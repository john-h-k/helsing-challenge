ANIMAL WELFARE (IMPORT OF DOGS, CATS AND FERRETS) BILL  
 
Memorandum from the  Department  for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  
to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee  
 
A. INTRODUCTION  
 
1. This memorandum has been prepared for the Delegated Powers and Regulatory 
Reform  Committee to assist with its scrutiny of the  Animal Welfare  (Import of Dogs, 
Cats and Ferrets ) Bill (“the Bill”). The Bill was introduced in the House of 
Commons  on 16th October 2024 and is schedule d for second read ing on 29 
November 2024 . This memorandum identifies the  provisions of the Bill that confer 
powers to make delegated legislation. It explains in  each case why the power has 
been taken and explain s the nature of, and the reason for, the procedure selected.  
 
B.  PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE BILL  
 
2. The Bill aims to address the issues of illegal puppy smuggling and the increasing 
volume of low -welfare movement of pet animals into the United Kingdom from 
third countries. These movements raise serious welfare issues, as evidence 
suggests that many imported puppies and kittens are being sourced from facilities 
with low welfare standards, with concerns about the way in which the animals 
have been kept and treated and the conditions in which they have been 
transported, which leads to poor health and welfare outcomes.  
 
3. The Bill aims to improve the welfare of imported dogs, cats and ferrets through : 
 
(1) making amendments to the pet travel scheme rules to prevent 
commercial imports being disguised  as non -commercial movements , 
specifically : 
 
a) reducing the number of dogs , cats  and ferrets that can travel under 
the non -commercial rules from five per person to five per vehicle, or 
three per foot or air passenger ; and 
b) ensuring that when a non -commercial movement of a dog, cat or 
ferret is carried out by an authorised person, it may only take place 
within five days of the movement of the owner ; and    
(2) introduc ing enabling powers to allow an appropriate national authority, 
for the purpose of promoting the welfare of dogs, cats and ferrets, to 
make regulations about the bringing of any of those animals into the 
United Kingdom  and related matters .

(3) a dog or cat that has been mutilated (i.e., a dog with cropped ears or a 
docked tail or a declawed cat).  
7. Pursuant to subsections ( 6) and ( 7), the appropriate national authority may make 
provision about dogs, cats or ferrets that are seized or detained for contravention 
of any animal welfare or health legislation that relates to the bringing of dogs, cats 
or ferrets into the United Kingdom , including in relation to meeting the costs of 
detention and transferring ownership of such animals . 
8. Pursuant to subsection ( 8), the appropriate national authority may  impos e 
monetary penalties for contravention of any animal welfare or health legislation 
that relates to the bringing of dogs, cats or ferrets into the United Kingdom . 
 
Justification for taking the power s 
 
9. The power s will ensure that the Department, the Welsh Ministers and the Scottish 
Ministers are able to act to prohibit the current main focus of our concerns, i.e. 
import s of young puppies and kittens , which , as well as raising welfare concerns, 
often do not comply with the current animal health rules, heavily pregnant dogs 
and cats , and those that have been mutilated.  
 
10. The powers will also enable the appropriate national authority to tackle low -
welfare imports of dogs, cats and ferrets through a range of enforcement tools 
and to tackle these imports dynamically. They will enable the appropriate national 
authority to address existing issues, for example , around how to proceed with an 
animal which has been seized and /or detained by the authorities for non -
compliance with relevant animal health and welfare rules, and subsequently 
abandoned , but they will also provide the mea ns to act in the future to close down 
emerging low -welfare practices, including attempts to circumvent restrictions. For 
example, t he powers will allow for the introduction of similar measures for ferrets 
in the future if low -welfare trade in this species escalates or evidence of welfare 
concerns is produced by stakeholders and regulators.  Illicit trade is quick to react 
to legislative and enforcement changes and so this ability to make future changes 
will be important to ensure that the policy aims are met.  Appropriate safeguards 
are included in relation to the powers of entry that may be conferred on 
enforcement authorities and the criminal offences that may be created.  
 
OFFICIAL – SENSITIVE  
4 
 11. The regulations setting out the prohibitions, exemptions, enforcement provisions , 
offences  and penalties made under the enabling power s will be complex and 
technical . The existing legislative regime governing the non -commercial 
movement and commercial import of dogs, cats and ferrets , and enforcement 
against non -compliance,  is complicated and involves the interaction of a  number 
of pieces of distinct but interlinked assimilated direct and domestic legislation.  
 
12. The Department believes that i ntroducing these measures in secondary 
legislation will be more suitable to the ir complexity, as well as  provid ing sufficient 
time to engage with Devolved Governments  and enforcement bodies to ensure 
that regulations are robust, comprehensive and can be implement ed effectively.   
 
13. Using power s, rather than including provisions on the face of the Bill, will also 
enable the U nited Kingdom  to meet its World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) 
obligations. The Department anticipates that the prohibitio ns that will be 
introduced under this power to address the kind of low -welfare imports currently 
entering the United Kingdom  may amount to technical regulations for the purposes 
of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. Where a WTO member is 
proposing to adopt technical regulations, which may have a significant effect on 
trade, it is obliged to consult other WTO members on the proposed technical 
regulations. The power will allow for appropriate consultation  with other WTO 
members to take place before any suc h technical regulations are adopted.  
Justification for the procedure  
 
14. The Department has considered the scope of the power s carefully and has 
balanced the need to be dynamic, and to be able to address new concerns 
regarding low -welfare imports quickly, against the need for Parliamentary 
oversight.  
 
15. Any measures delivered via the delegated power s will be made by Statutory 
Instrument subject to the draft affirmative procedure , except where the regulations 
only contain provision on the fees payable in relation to applications for permits . 
We consider the affirmative procedure to apply the appropriate level of scrutiny in 
its assessment of these measures, its impacts, and any evidence supplied, which 
must be actively approved in both Houses of Parliament.  We consider that the 
negative procedure is appropr iate for regulations which set fees, which will need 
to be set to recover the costs incurred in determining applications for permits and 
will need to b e adjusted to reflect those costs from time to time.

Context and Purpose  
 
16. This Clause provides that regulations  made under Clause 1 may amend , repeal 
or revoke primary legislation.  
 
Justification for taking the power  
 
17. This power may only be exercised in connection with exercising the powers in 
Claus e 1 of the Bill. It is not possible to establish in advance all supplementary, 
incidental and consequential provision that may be required, and these may 
include a future requirement to make consequential amendments to primary 
legislation , e.g. to create or amend offences and increase penalties, which may 
include imprisonment, and create powers of entry; or to  make further amendments 
to those provisions of the  pet travel scheme rules  that are  being amended by the 
Bill such as the maximum number of pets permitted to enter Great Britain non -
commercially in a vehicle . A power is needed to bring certainty to the statute book 
where a provision of the Bill might otherwise give rise to any legal uncertainty or 
legal lacunas after the Bill comes into force.   
 
Justification for the procedure  
  
18. The Department believes that, on balance, the increased parliamentary scrutiny 
of the affirmative procedure is appropriate and is consistent with the level of 
parliamentary scrutiny required of regulations to promote welfare under the Animal 
Welfare Act 2006 , the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006  and the 
Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 .  
 
Clause 6: Consequential provision  
 
(3) Power to make consequential provision  
 
Power conferred on:  the Secretary of State  
 
Power exercised by:  regulations  
 
Parliamentary Procedure:  negative procedure  
 
Context and Purpose  
 
19. This Clause gives a power to the Secretary of State to make regulations to make 
any provision which  is consequential on the provision made by Clause s 4 or 5 , 
which make  changes to the rules governing the non -commercial movement of pet 
animals .  
 
Justification for taking the power  
 
20. This power may only be exercised in connection with Clauses 4 or 5 ; it is not to 
be used in isolation to make unwarranted supplementary, incidental or 
consequential provisions. Given that the existing legislative regime governing the 
OFFICIAL – SENSITIVE

 non-commercial movement and commercial import of dogs, cats and ferrets, and 
enforcement against non -compliance, is complicated and involves the interaction 
of a number of pieces of distinct but interlinked assimilated direct and domestic 
legislation,  it is not possible to establish in advance all supplementary, incidental 
and consequential provisions that may be required. A power is needed to bring 
certainty to the statute book where a provision of the Bill might otherwise give rise 
any legal uncertaint y or legal lacunas after the Bill comes into force.  
 
Justification for the procedure  
 
21. The changes to legislation are likely to be technical matters for which the negative 
resolution procedure is appropriate ( e.g., making consequential amendments to 
existing secondary legislation).

Power exercised by:  regulations

contain provision on fees in relation to permit applications, negative procedure  
 
Context and Purpose  
 
22. This Clause provides that regulations made under the Bill may make 
consequential, transitional or saving provisions and make different provision for 
different purposes or different areas.  
 
Justification for taking the power  
 
23. Given that the existing legislative regime governing the non -commercial 
movement and commercial import of dogs, cats and ferrets, and enforcement 
against non -compliance, is complicated and involves the interaction of a number 
of pieces of distinct but inte rlinked assimilated direct and domestic legislation, i t is 
not possible to establish in advance all supplementary, incidental and 
consequential provisions that may be required. A power is needed to bring 
certainty to the statute book where a provision of t he Bill might otherwise give rise 
to any legal uncertainty or legal lacunas after the Bill comes into force.  
 
Justification for the procedure  
  
24. The Department believes that, on balance, the increased parliamentary scrutiny 
of the affirmative procedure is appropriate and is consistent with the level of 
parliamentary scrutiny required of regulations to promote welfare under the Animal 
Welfare Act 2006, the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and the 
Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ire land) 2011.

25. Sub-section (3) provides that Clauses 1 to 7 come into force on such day as the 
Secretary of State may by regulations appoint.   Pursuant to sub -section (6), this 
includes the power to make different provision for different purposes . 
 
26. Sub-section (5) provides that t he Secretary of State may by regulations make such 
transitional or saving provision as the Secretary of State considers appropriate in 
connection with the coming into force of any provision of the Bill.  
 
Justification for taking the power s 
27. It is appropriate to provide for commencement of the provisions of the Bill by 
regulations and to include transitional provision in relation to their commencement  
to allow for the provisions to be brought into force at an appropriate time . 
Commencement of provisions of a Bill by way of regulations is standard pr actice.   
 
Justification for the procedure  
 
28. Consistent with common practice in relation to commencement regulations and 
associated transitional provision, regulations made under this clause are not 
subject to any Parliamentary procedure. Parliament has approved the principle of 
the provisions to be commenced by enacting them; commencement by 
regulations enables the provisions to be brought into force at the appropriate time 
and in an orderly manner
