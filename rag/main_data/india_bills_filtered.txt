Further, it lays down the rates at which tax is to be deducted at source during the financial

1992. Further, sub-clause (c) of the said clause, provides that capital asset means any unit 
linked insurance policy to which exemption under clause (10D) of section 10 does not apply

It is proposed to amend sub-clause (b) of the said clause so as to insert the expression “or 
held by an investment fund specified in clause (a) of Explanation 1 to section 115UB” after

It is further proposed to amend sub-clause (c) of clause (14) of the said section so as to 
make it applicable for unit linked insurance policy to which exemption under clause (10D) 
of section 10 does not apply. 

These amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2026 and will, accordingly, apply in 

relation to the assessment year 2026-2027 and subsequent assessment years. 

Clause (22) of the said section provides the definition of dividend. Sub-clause (e) of the 
said clause, inter alia, provides that any payment by a company, not being a company in

to a fixed rate of dividend whether with or without a right to participate in profits) holding 
not less than ten per cent. of the voting power, or to any concern in which such shareholder 
is a member or a partner and in which he has a substantial interest (hereafter in this clause 
referred to as the said concern) or any payment by any such company on behalf, or for the 
individual benefit, of any such shareholder, to the extent to which the company in either case

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The  general  elections  to  the  House  of  the  People  and  all  State  Legislative 
Assemblies were held simultaneously in the years 1951-52, 1957, 1962 and 1967. 
However, due to premature dissolution of some Legislative Assemblies in 1968 and 
1969, the cycle of holding polls simultaneously with the House of the People got 
disrupted.  The  Law  Commission  of  India  in  its  170th  report,  on  “Reform  of  the 
Electoral  Laws”,  inter  alia,  suggested  that  holding  separate  elections  for  State 
Legislative Assemblies should be an exception rather than the rule. According to 
the Commission,  the general  rule  should  be to  conduct elections once every  five 
years for the House of the People and all State Legislative Assemblies together. The 
Department  related  Parliamentary  Standing  Committee  on  Personnel,  Public 
Grievances and Law and Justice, in its 79th report had also examined the feasibility 
of holding simultaneous elections to the House of the People (Lok Sabha) and State 
Legislative Assemblies and recommended an alternative and practicable methods of 
holding simultaneous elections is needed and expressed confidence that a solution 
would be found to reduce the frequency of electoral processes.  

2. There  is  an  imperative  need  for  holding  of  simultaneous  elections  for
various  reasons  and  given  that  elections  have  become  expensive  and  time 
consuming.  The  imposition  of  Model  Code  of  Conduct  in  several  parts  of  the 
country which are poll bound put on hold the entire development programmes, cause 
disruption of normal public life, impact the functioning of services and also curtail 
the  involvement  of  manpower  from  their  core  activities  for  deployment  for 
prolonged periods for election duties.  

3. The  High  Level  Committee  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Shri  Ram  Nath
Kovind,  former  President  of  India  was  constituted  on  2nd  September,  2023  to 
examine the issue of simultaneous elections and make recommendations for holding 
simultaneous elections in the country. After due deliberation and examination of all 
the  material  available  on  record  and  the  consultations  held  on  the  subject,  the 
the  Hon’ble  President  on 
Committee  submitted 
14th March, 2024. The Government has accepted the recommendations of the High 
Level Committee. 

its  recommendations 

to 

4. The High Level Committee, inter alia, has recommended that in the first
stage elections to the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies should be 
held simultaneously. For implementation of the recommendations of the High Level 
Committee,  a  Bill,  namely,  the  Constitution  (One  Hundred  and  Twenty-ninth 
Amendment) Bill, 2024 is proposed providing for holding of simultaneous elections 
to the House of the People and all Legislative Assemblies.  

5. The Bill proposes to insert a new article 82A (Simultaneous elections to the
House  of  the  People  and  all  Legislative  Assemblies)  and  to  amend  article  83 
(Duration of Houses of Parliament), article 172 (Duration of State Legislatures) and 
article  327  (Power  of  Parliament  to  make  provision  with  respect  to  elections  to 
Legislatures). 

6. The aforesaid Bill, inter alia, provides that after its enactment, a notification
is to be issued by the President on the date of the first sitting of the House of the 
People after a general election, and that date of the notification shall be called the 
appointed date. The tenure of the House of the People shall be five years from that 
appointed date. The tenure of all Legislative Assemblies, constituted by elections to 
the Legislative Assemblies after the appointed date and before the expiry of the full 
term of the House of the People, shall come to an end on the expiry of the full term 
of  the  House  of  the People.  Thereafter,  all  general  elections  to  the  House  of  the 
People and all Legislative Assemblies shall be held together simultaneously. In case 
of dissolution of the House of the People or a Legislative Assembly, sooner than the 

4 

5 

full term of the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly, the term of the 
House or Assembly constituted pursuant to elections shall be for the unexpired term 
of the House or the Assembly. 

7. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to a foreign vessel 

which has become, and is sought to be registered as, an Indian vessel. 

33. When a registered vessel is so altered as not to correspond with the 
particulars  relating  to  her  tonnage  or  description  contained  in  the  register 
book,  then,  if  the  alteration  is  made  at  any  port  having  a  Registrar,  that 
Registrar,  or  if  it  is  made  elsewhere,  the  Registrar  of  the  first  port  at  which 
the  vessel  arrives  after  the  alteration,  shall,  on  an  application  being  made  to 
him  by  the  owner  stating  the  particulars  of  the  alteration,  either  cause  the 
alteration to be registered or direct that the vessel be re-registered:  

Provided  that  in  case  the  vessel  so  altered  is  outside  Indian  port,  the 
Registrar  may  on  report  of  inspection  of  such  vessel  by  a  surveyor  or  the 
person  authorised  under  sub-section  (1)  of  section  9,  re-register  the  vessel 
without any requirement of the vessel to visit Indian port. 

34. Where any Registrar, not being the Registrar of the vessel’s port of 
registry, on an application as to an alteration in a vessel directs the vessel to 
be  re-registered,  he  shall  either  grant  a  provisional  certificate  describing  the 
vessel as altered, or provisionally endorse the particulars of the alteration on 
the existing certificate. 

35.  The  registration  of  any  vessel  may  be  transferred  from  one  port  or 
place  of  registry  to  another  on an  application  to  the Registrar  of  the  existing 
port  or  place  of  registry  of  the  vessel  made  by  declaration  in  writing  of  all 
persons  appearing  in  the  register  to  be  interested  therein  as  owners  or 
mortgagees,  but  that  transfer  shall  not  in  any  way  affect  the  rights  of  those 
persons  or  any  of  them  and  those  rights  shall  in  all  respects  continue  in  the 
same manner as if no such transfer had been effected.  

36.  Where  a  vessel  has  ceased  to  be  registered  as  an  Indian  vessel  by 
reason  of  having  been  wrecked  or  abandoned,  or  for  any  reason  other  than

expense of the applicant, been surveyed by a surveyor and certified by him to 
be seaworthy.

national  colours  for  all  Indian  vessels  and  for  all  vessels  owned  by  the 
Government  and  different  colours  may  be  declared  for  different  classes  of

vessel  on  which  any  colours  are  hoisted  contrary  to  this  Act  and  seize  and 
take away the colours which shall be forfeited to the Government.  

(4) No person  onboard  a vessel which  is not an  Indian  vessel  shall,  for 
the purpose of making it appear to be an Indian vessel, use the Indian national 
colours,  unless  the  assumption  of  Indian  character  has  been  made  for  the 
purpose of escaping capture by the enemy or by a foreign vessel of war in the 
exercise of some belligerent right.

38. No owner or master of an Indian vessel shall knowingly do anything 
or permit anything to be done, or carry or permit to be carried any papers or 
documents, with intent to conceal the Indian character of the vessel from any 
person entitled by any law for the time being in force to inquire into the same, 
or  with  intent  to  assume  a  foreign  character  for  the  vessel,  or  with  intent  to 
deceive any person so entitled. 

39.  Where  it  is  declared  by  this  Act  that  an  Indian  vessel  shall  not  be 
recognised as such, that vessel shall not be entitled to any privileges, benefits, 
advantages or protection usually enjoyed by Indian vessel or to use the Indian 
national  colours  for  Indian  vessel  or  to  assume  the  Indian  national  character 
but so far as regards the payment of dues, the liability to fine or penalty and 
forfeiture  and  the  punishment  of  offences  committed  onboard  such  vessel  or 
by  any  person  belonging  to  her,  such  vessel  shall  be  dealt  with  in  the  same 
manner in all respects as if she were a recognised Indian vessel. 

40.  Where  any  vessel  has  either  wholly  or  as  to  any  share  therein 
become subject to forfeiture under this Part, any commissioned officer of the 
Indian  Navy  or  Indian  Coast  Guard  or  an  Indian  ambassador  or  any  other 
officer  authorised  by  the  Central  Government,  may  seize  and  detain  the 
vessel,  under  the  directions  of  the  proper  officer  and  bring  her  for 
adjudication  before  the  High  Court  and  the  High  Court  may  thereupon 
adjudge the vessel with her equipment to be forfeited to the Government and 
make  such order  in  the case  as  the High Court  seems  just and  may  award  to 
the officer bringing in the vessel for adjudication such portion of the proceeds 
of the sale of the vessel or any share therein as the High Court thinks fit.

shall be  subject  to  all  the pecuniary penalties or  fine  imposed  by  this Act  or 
any  other  law  for  the  time  being  in  force  on  the  owners  of  vessel  or  shares 
therein,  and  proceedings  for  the  enforcement  of  any  such  penalties  or  fine

respect of wages which have been intimated.

commencement or during the progress of a voyage, or be absent at any time 
without leave and without sufficient reason from his vessel or from his duty.  

5 

(2) For the purposes of sub-section (1), the fact that the vessel on which the 
seafarer is engaged or to which he belongs is unseaworthy, shall be deemed to be 
a reasonable cause for desertion or absence without leave:

to proceed to sea in his vessel or before absenting himself or being absent from 
the  vessel  complained  to  the  master  or  a  shipping  master,  surveyor,  seafarer’s 
welfare officer, port health officer, Indian ambassador or any other officer at any 
port duly authorised in this behalf by the Central Government, that the vessel is 
unseaworthy.

deserted his vessel or has absented himself without leave and without sufficient 
reason from his vessel or from his duty, the shipping master shall forthwith make 
a report to that effect to the Director-General who may thereupon direct that the 
seafarer’s continuous discharge certificate and seafarer identity document shall be 
withheld for such period as may be specified in that direction, or may suspend or 
withdraw  the  certificate  of  competency  or  certificate  of  proficiency  of  the 
deserting  seafarer,  if  it  is  established  that  such  desertion  was  without  leave  or 
sufficient reason: 

 Provided that no order of withholding, suspension or cancellation shall be 

passed unless the seafarer has been given an opportunity of being heard. 

(4)  If  a seafarer  deserts his vessel  or  is  absent without  leave and without 
sufficient reason from his vessel or from his duty, the master, any seafarer, the 
ship owner or his agent may, without prejudice to any other action that may be 
taken against the seafarer under this Act, convey him onboard his vessel and may 
for  that  purpose  cause  to  be  used  such  force  as  may  be  reasonable  in  the 
circumstances of the case.  

(5) If, either at the commencement or during the progress of any voyage, a 
seafarer  engaged  in  an  Indian  vessel  commits  outside  India,  the  offence  of 
desertion or absence without leave or any offence against discipline, the master 
or the ship owner or his agent may, if and so far as the laws in force in the place 
permit, arrest him without procuring a warrant.  

(6)  No  person  shall  convey  onboard  or  arrest  a  seafarer  on  improper  or 

insufficient grounds. 

(7) Where a seafarer is brought before a court on the ground of desertion or 
of absence without leave or of any offence against discipline, and the master or 
the ship owner or his agent so requires, the court may, in lieu of committing and 
sentencing him for the offence, cause him to be conveyed onboard his vessel for 
the purpose of proceeding on the voyage, or deliver him to the master or the ship 
owner or his agent to be by them so conveyed, and may in such case order any 
costs and expenses properly incurred by or on behalf of the master or ship owner 
by reason of the conveyance to be paid by the offender and, if necessary, to be 
deducted  from  any  wages  which  he  has  then  earned  or  by  virtue  of  his  then 
existing engagements may afterwards be earned.

102.  Whenever  any  seafarer  engaged  outside  India  on  an  Indian  vessel 
deserts  or  otherwise  absents  himself  in  India  without  leave,  the  master  of  the 
vessel  shall,  within  forty-eight  hours of discovering  such  desertion  or absence, 
report  the  same  to  the  shipping  master  or  to  such  other  officer  as  the  Central 
Government  specifies  in  this  behalf,  unless  in  the  meantime,  the  deserter  or 
absentee returns.

10 

103. (1) In every case of desertion from an Indian vessel whilst such vessel 
is at any place out of India, the master shall produce the entry of desertion in the 
official logbook to the Indian ambassador at the place, who shall thereupon make 
and certify a copy of the entry which shall be admissible in evidence in any legal 
proceeding relating to such desertion. 

(2) The master shall forthwith transmit such copy of entry certified under 
sub-section  (1)  to  the  shipping  master  at  the  port  at  which  the  seafarer  was 
shipped, and the shipping master shall, if required, cause the same to be produced 
in any legal proceeding.  

104. (1) Whenever a question arises whether the wages of any seafarer are 
forfeited for desertion from a vessel, it shall be sufficient for the person insisting 
on the forfeiture to show that the seafarer was duly engaged in or belonged to the 
vessel, and either that he left the vessel  before the completion of the voyage or 
engagement  or,  if  the  voyage  was  to  terminate  in  India  and  the  vessel  has  not

made in the official logbook.  

(2) The desertion shall thereupon, so far as relate to any forfeiture of wages

certificate of discharge or otherwise show to the satisfaction of the court that he 
had sufficient reasons for leaving his vessel.  

105.  Where  any  wages  or  other  property  are  under  this  Act  forfeited  for 
desertion from a vessel, they shall be applied towards reimbursing the expenses 
caused by such desertion to the master or the ship owner or his agent, which may 
be recovered by the master, or the ship owner or his agent in the same manner as 
the  deserter  could  have  recovered  them  if  not  forfeited,  and  subject  to  that 
reimbursement, shall be paid to the Central Government.  

106. Any question concerning the forfeiture of or deductions from the wages 
of a seafarer may be determined in any proceeding lawfully instituted with respect 
to those wages, notwithstanding that the offence in respect of which the question 
arises, though by this Act made punishable by imprisonment as well as forfeiture 
has not been made the subject of any criminal proceeding.  

107. (1) Every fine imposed on a seafarer for any act of misconduct under 

his agreement shall be deducted and paid as follows, namely:— 

(a) if the offender is discharged at any port or place in India and the

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (the 1958 Act) was enacted to foster the 
development and ensure the efficient maintenance of an Indian mercantile marine 
in  a  manner  best  suited  to  serve  the  national  interests  and  establish  a  National 
Shipping Board and to provide for the registration, certification, safety and security 
of  Indian  ships.  The  1958  Act  contains  561  sections,  as  a  result  of  various 
amendments carried out in the Act from time to time.  

2.  The  merchant  shipping  industry  has  experienced  significant  changes 
internationally in recent years, presenting various challenges to Indian shipping. To 
address these challenges and promote ease of doing business, reforms in the 1958 
Act  became  essential.  These  reforms  include,  inter  alia,  to  reduce  compliance 
burden while improving operational efficiency; enhance the quality and quantity of 
tonnage  under  Indian  flag  to  strengthen  India’s  presence  in  the  global  shipping 
market; improve the rights, privileges, and  protections for seafarers, ensuring their 
welfare  and  dignity;  ensure  the  safety  and  security  of  vessels  and  life  at  sea  by 
adhering  to  safety  protocols;  prevent  marine  pollution  and  safeguard  the  marine 
environment;  provide  for  maritime  liabilities  and  compensation  mechanisms  to 
address  contingencies  effectively;  align  with  global  best  practices  by  adopting 
India’s  obligations  under  international  conventions  comprehensively;  boost  the 
sector’s  attractiveness  as  an  investment  destination  by  creating  a  conducive 
regulatory  environment  and  promoting  transparency  and  accountability  in  the 
shipping  industry.  These  reforms  aim  to  modernise  the  sector,  enhance  its 
competitiveness, and align it with global standards to meet evolving international 
demands. 

3.  In  view  of  the  above,  it  has  become  imperative  to  repeal  the  Merchant 
Shipping Act, 1958, and to provide for contemporaneous, futuristic and dynamic 
legislation, namely, the Merchant Shipping Bill, 2024 to meet the requirements of 
India as an emerging economy. The Merchant Shipping Bill, 2024, inter alia, seeks 
to provide for the following, namely:— 

(i)  expanding  the  eligibility  criteria  for  ownership  of  the  vessels  and 

increasing tonnage under the Indian flag;

indemnity under a contract or otherwise. It also specifies certain claims which shall 
not be subject to limitation. The explanations clarify that the invocation of limitation 
of liability shall not be an admission of liability; and the ship owner includes owner,

further provides that if the limitation amount in respect of claims of loss of life or 
personal injury is insufficient, the limitation amount in respect of any other claims 
shall be used to pay the unpaid balance of the former claim. It further provides for 
the  hierarchy  in  which  the other  claims  are  to  be  paid,  that  is,  first  by  claims  in 
respect of loss of life or personal injury followed by claims in respect of damage to 
harbour works, basins, waterways and aids to navigation. It also provides that the 
limit of liability in case of salvor not operating from any vessel or for any salvor

at a rate notified by the Central Government, from the date of occurrence giving 
rise to the liability until the date of the constitution of the fund. It also provides

available  only  for  the  payment  of  claims  in  respect  of  which  limitation  of 
liability  may  be  invoked and  the  fund so  constituted by  one  of  the persons  or 
ship owners or salvors specified in clause 166 or his insurer, shall be deemed to

settles  a  claim  before  the  fund  is  distributed,  then  the  right  of  the  claimant 
against the fund is subrogated to that person or insurer. It further provides that 
the right of subrogation exists even for persons other than the person liable or 
his insurer, in respect of any amount of compensation which such person may 
have paid. It also provides that the High Court or the Central Government, as 
the  case  may  be,  may  order  a  sufficient  sum  to  be  provisionally  set  aside  to 
enable a person liable or any other person to enforce his claim against the fund 
at a later date when this person liable or any other person proves that he needs 
to pay at  a  later  date wholly or  partly any such  amount of  compensation with 
regard  to  which  such  person  would  have  enjoyed  a  right  of  subrogation  as

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

Coastal shipping in India holds great potential owing to vast coastline of around 
7500  kilometers  and  proximity  to  important  global  shipping  routes.  It  has  been 
recognised  that  maritime  transportation,  particularly  coastal  shipping  is  cheaper 
compared  to  other  modes  of  transportation.  There  is  a  need  to  improve  transport 
connectivity and supporting infrastructure in the coastal maritime transport sector. 
The cost of transportation and logistics directly impacts the production cost and there 
has been a concerted policy effort to improve efficiencies in this regard. 

2.  The  regulation  of  the  coastal  maritime  sector  in  India  lacks  uniformity.     

Non-mechanised vessels engaged in coastwise trade are governed by the Coasting 
Vessels Act, 1838 which only provides for registration of such vessels. The measures 
pertaining  to  regulation,  safety,  security  and  pollution  prevention  also  need  to  be 
addressed. The mechanised vessels on the other hand fall under the purview of the 
Merchant Shipping Act, 1958. 

3. The present regulatory framework under Part XIV of the Merchant Shipping 
Act,  1958,  requires  Indian  ship  as  well  as  ships  chartered  by  Indian  citizens  and 
foreign  vessels  to  obtain  licence  before  taking  ship  to  sea,  including  for  coasting 
trade. However,  the  licencing  requirement  for  all  vessels including  Indian  vessels 
and  exclusion  of  foreign  flag  non-propelled  vessels  from  the  coasting  trade  has 
proven  to  be  a  hindrance  to  competition  and  efficiency  of  the  sector.  It  is  felt 
necessary  to  bring  foreign  flag  non-propelled  mobile  offshore  drilling  units, 
accommodation barges, etc., also within the purview of the regulatory requirements. 

4.  In  view  of  the  challenges  arising  in  the  regulation  of  coasting  trade,  it  is 
considered  necessary  to  strengthen  the  regulation  of  vessels  engaged  in  coasting 
trade  by  adopting  the  best  global  practices,  to  meet  the  present  and  future 
requirements of the maritime coastal shipping sector. 

5.  The  Coastal  Shipping  Bill,  2024,  inter  alia,  seeks  to  provide  for  the 

following, namely:— 

(i)  to  repeal  Part  XIV  of  the  Merchant  Shipping  Act,  1958  relating  to 
control  of  Indian  ships  and  ships  engaged  in  coasting  trade  (except             
section 411A thereof); 

(ii) to include the term “service” in the definition of “coasting trade” so 
as to bring offshore vessels which generally provide services without engaging 
in transportation of goods and passengers, within the ambit of the Bill; 

(iii) prohibition of coasting trade in the coastal water without licence by 
vessels other  than  Indian vessels and  permitting  Inland vessels to  engage in 
coastal trading subject to certain conditions; 

(iv) empowering the Director-General to issue licence after taking into 
consideration  certain  factors  including  citizenship  of  the  crew  and  building 
requirements of the vessel so as to create more jobs for Indian seafarers and to 
promote ship building in India; 

(v)  requirement  of  licence  by  vessels  chartered  by  Indian  entities  for 

purposes other than coasting trade; 

(vi) creation of a National Database of Coastal Shipping so as to ensure 

transparency of procedure and aid in information sharing; 

(vii) preparation of a National Coastal and Inland Shipping Strategic Plan 

for development, growth and promotion of coastal shipping; 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
15 

(viii) provision for compounding of certain offences and imposition of 

penalty by the principal officer; and 

(ix)  provision  for  empowering  the  Director-General  to  call  for 

information in respect of certain matters. 

6. The Notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions contained in 

the Bill. 

7. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

are  matters  of  procedure  and  administrative  details,  and  as  such,  it  is  not 
practicable  to provide  for  them  in  the Bill  itself. The delegation  of  legislative 
power is, therefore, of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Ever  since  India  attained  independence  in  1947  the  country  has  progressed  in  many 
fields.  There  has  been  considerable  development  and  growth  in  industry,  infrastructure, 
employment  opportunities,  medical  facilities  and  education  facilities  and  social  welfare 
schemes. The standard of living of population has seen a positive growth in last 75 years. 
The poverty level has been contained and the literacy level has increased to a great level. 
The export from the country has been increasing rapidly over the years. The Make in India 
concept  has  been  successful  and  our  imports  of  various  products  has  seen  a  significant 
decline in the recent years.

However it may be seen that the growth is restricted mainly to metropolitan cities, a 
few  select  States  and  Union  Territories.  There  is  considerable  regional  imbalance  in  the 
country. There are many districts in the country which do not even have a single industry. 
People of these areas have to migrate to other places in search of their livelihood, medical 
and educational facilities, etc. Therefore it is necessary that an Action Plan be carried out for 
the speedy development of these backward regions.

It is accordingly proposed to set up a Board which would recommend the steps to be 

taken by the Government for the development of backward areas.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to make provision for setting up of a Board for development 
of  backward  areas  in  the  country.  The  Bill  further  seeks  to  provide  for  appointment  of 
Chairman  and  members  of  the  Board.  Clause  6  provides  for  the  Central  Government  to 
provide adequate fund. The Bill, therefore, if enacted, would involve expenditure from the 
Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated that a recurring expenditure of about rupees one 
lakh crore per annum would be involved from the Consolidated Fund of India. 

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees three lakh crore is also likely to be involved.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause 8 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out 
the purposes of the Bill.  As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, the delegation of

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The rapid growth of the transportation industry has led to an increase  in the number 
of passengers who rely on various modes of transportation, such as airlines, railways, and 
roadways,  to  travel  across  the  country.  However,  there  have  been  numerous  instances  of 
passengers  facing  inconvenience  and  difficulties  due  to  delays,  cancellations,  denied 
boarding,  and  loss  or  damage  to  baggage.  Despite  the  existence  of  various  laws  and 
regulations,  passengers  often  struggle  to  enforce  their  rights  and  receive  proper 
compensation for such issues. 

Therefore,  the  purpose  of  this  Private  Members  Bill  is  to  establish  an  All  India 
Passenger Services Authority to ensure the protection of the rights of passengers traveling 
through various modes of transportation. The proposed authority will serve as a regulatory 
body that will oversee the functioning of passenger services provided by airlines, railways, 
and roadways. 

The  authority  will  have  the  power  to  enforce  strict  guidelines  for  the  protection  of 
passengers’ rights, including compensation for flight delay, cancellation, denied boarding, 
and baggage loss or damage. The authority will also ensure that passengers who frequently 
travel to different destinations feel protected under the regulations. 

The proposed bill aims to provide passengers with a sense of security and protection 
when  traveling  across  the  country.  It  is  essential  to  establish  a  regulatory  body  that  can 
safeguard  passengers’  rights  and  enforce  strict  guidelines  to  ensure  that  transportation 
service providers comply with the regulations. 

Therefore, the proposed All India Passenger Services Authority Bill seeks to address 
the issue of protecting passengers’ rights and improving the quality of passenger services 
provided by transportation service providers in the country.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  loss  of  lives  and  damages  to  dwelling  units,  commercial  spaces,  machines, 

tools,  crops,  livestock,  etc.  due  to  lightning  strikes  across  the  country  have  increased  in 

recent times. 

There  has  been  nearly  a  35  per  cent.  increase  in  the  overall  count  of  lightning 

strikes and 40 per cent. increase in incidents of cloud to ground lightning in the country. 

Thunderstorms and lightning have emerged as major weather hazards in recent years, killing 

about  2,500  people  annually  and  the  most  affected  are  people  in  rural  areas  or  working 

outdoors are most at risk. 

Because of the climate change constituting heat waves further in coming years, the 

lightning strikes are also expected to increase more.  

India suffers huge human casualties from lightning compared to other developed 

countries and about two people in a million die from lightning and properties worth several 
crores get damaged in India each year. 

A bolt from the blue that kills thousands in India and yet the Central Government 

is yet to declare lightning a natural disaster, saying that deaths caused by lightning can be 

avoided  through  education  and  awareness.  This  justification  by  the  Central  Government 

cannot  and  will  not  be  accepted    as  every  disaster  can  be  prevented  by  education  and 

awareness and not only the lightning disaster alone. 

Many  States  have  been  demanding  the  Central  Government  to  declare  lightning 

strike  a  natural  disaster.  Therefore,  the  Central  Government  should  declare  lightning  a 

natural  disaster  or  calamity  to  get  compensation  for  the  victims  of  this  lightning  natural 

disaster.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  appointment  of  an  Appropriate  Authority 
for  providing  financial  assistance  and  rehabilitation  measures  to  the  victims  of  lightning 
disaster.  Clause  4  provides  for  financial  assistance  of  rupees  ten  lakh  to  the  next  of  kin 
of a person who dies in any lightning disaster and medical treatment for injured persons 
and  other  welfare  measures  for  the  victims  of  lightning  disaster.    The  Bill,  therefore,  if 
enacted, will involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is not possible to 
give an exact estimate of the actual expenditure to be involved to meet any unpredictable 
eventuality. However, it is estimated that recurring expenditure of rupees one thousand crore 
per annum would be involved from the Consolidated Fund of India. 

A non-recurring expenditure to the tune of rupees five thousand crore is also  likely 

to be involved.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Internships plays a crucial role in shaping the career of the students, particularly to those 
enrolled in professional and technical courses. The Internship not only helps the students to 
gain real exposure to the working environment but also helps to develop requisite skills for 
their future avenues. In the Indian perspective, the need is to  enhance the quality of education 
in  professional  and  technical  courses  by  providing  students  with  structured  internship 
opportunities.  By  ensuring  that  companies  offer  internships  based  on  their  capacity  and 
provide basic remuneration, students will gain practical experience and financial support. 
The proposed establishment of a National Internship Portal will streamline the application 
process, making it easier for students to find suitable internships and for companies to find 
qualified interns.

The Bill aims to bridge the gap between academic learning and professional practice, 
thereby  improving  employability  and  career  readiness  among  students  enrolled  in 
professional and technical course.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 6 of the Bill provides that the Central Government shall establish a National 
Internship  Portal  to  facilitate  internship  applications  and  placements  of  the  Students.  
Clause 8 provides for establishment of a Monitoring mechanism by the Central Government. 
Clause 9 provides for the Central Government to provide adequate funds. The Bill, therefore, 
if enacted, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated 
that a recurring expenditure of about rupees five hundred crore per annum is likely to be 
involved from the Consolidated Fund of India. 

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees fifty crore is also likely to be involved.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The Polavaram Project is a National Project and is considered the lifeline of the people 
of Andhra Pradesh, having grave important to the State’s people. As per the Andhra Pradesh 
Reorganisation Act,  2014,  it  is  upon  the  Central  Government  to  execute  the  project  and 
obtain  all  requisite  clearances  including  environmental,  forests  and  rehabilitation  and 
resettlement norms.

The estimated cost was Rs. 16,010.45 crore at the 2010-11 Price Level and has increased 
multi folds considering time and cost overruns, the inclusion of command area development 
works and increased compensation under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency 
in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Owing to the inflation and 
severe cost overruns, it is difficult to execute the project in 2022 at the 2011-12 Price Level.

The Andhra Pradesh Government submitted the 2nd Revised Cost Estimate (REC-II) 
for  Rs.  57,297.42  crore  at  2017-18  Price  Level  in  2018  with  the  provisions  required  for 
completion of the Polavaram Irrigation Project as recommended by the Polavaram Project 
Authority.  The  Technical Advisory  Committee  (TAC)  of  the  Central  Water  Commission 
approved RCE-II for Rs. 55,548.87 crore at the 2017-18 Price Level in 2019. Further, the 
same dispensation is sought for funding the water supply component from the centre, as it is 
an integral part of the irrigation component. But regardless of the submission, these issues 
are yet to be placed before the cabinet for their approval. The Bill, therefore seeks to amend 
the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 to achieve the stated objectives.

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

As the banking sector has evolved over the years and with a view to improve 
bank governance and investor’s protection, it has become necessary to make certain 
amendments  in  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  Act,  1934,  the  Banking  Regulation        
Act,  1949  (the  “BR  Act”),  the  State  Bank  of  India  Act,  1955,  the  Banking 
Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 and the Banking 
Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act,1980.  

2.  The  proposed  Bill  seeks,  inter  alia,  to  improve  governance  standards, 
provide  consistency  in  reporting  by  banks  to  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  ensure 
better protection for depositors and investors, improve audit quality in public sector 
banks,  bring  customer  convenience  in  respect  of  nominations  and  to  provide  for 
increase in the tenure of the directors in co-operative banks.  

3.  Therefore,  it  is  felt  necessary  to  amend  the  said  enactments  and  for  that 
purpose to introduce the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 in Parliament. The 
salient features of the amendments proposed in the said Bill, inter alia, are— 

(a) to amend clause (ne) of  section 5 of the BR Act so as to redefine 
“substantial interest”, increasing the threshold for shareholding of a beneficial 
interest by an individual, etc., from five lakhs rupees to two crore rupees, to 
reflect the present value, as the same was last fixed in 1968; 

(b) to amend clause (i) of sub-section (2A) of section 10A of the BR Act, 
increasing  the  tenure  of  directors  (excluding  the  chairman  and  whole-time 
director) in co-operative banks from eight years to ten  years, so as to align 
with the Constitution (Ninety-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2011; 

(c) to amend sub-section (3) of section 16 of the BR Act, so as to allow 
a  director  of  a  central  co-operative  bank  to  serve  on  the  board  of  a  state            
co-operative bank; 

(d) to amend sections 18, 24, 25 and section 56 of the BR Act, to revise 
the  reporting  dates  for  the  submission  of  statutory  reports  by  banks  to  the 
Reserve Bank of India, so as to align them to the last day of the fortnight or 
month or quarter, to ensure consistency in reporting; 

(e) to amend sections 45ZA, 45ZC, and 45ZE of the BR Act, so as to allow 
for the nomination of up to four persons, including provisions for simultaneous 
and successive nominations, to ease services for depositors and their nominees, 
particularly regarding deposits, articles in safe custody, and safety lockers; 

(f) to amend section 38A of the State Bank of India Act, 1955, section 10B 
of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 
and  section  10B  of  the  Banking  Companies  (Acquisition  and  Transfer  of 
Undertakings) Act, 1980, so as to provide for the transfer of unclaimed dividends, 
shares, and interest or redemption of bonds to the Investor Education and Protection 
Fund, and allow individuals to claim transfers or refunds from that fund; 

(g) to amend section 41 of the State Bank of India Act, 1955, section 10 
of  the  Banking  Companies  (Acquisition  and  Transfer  of  Undertakings)         
Act, 1970 and section 10 of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer 
of Undertakings) Act, 1980, so as to provide discretion to public sector banks 
in the matter of remuneration of auditors. 

4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The Indian Bills of Lading Act, 1856 (the said Act) was enacted to amend the 

Law relating to Bills of Lading with a view to address two aspects, namely,–– 

(a) transferring of all rights in respect of the contract contained in the
bill of lading along with the property to the consignee or endorsee of the bill 
of lading; and  

(b) ensuring that a transferred bill of lading in the hands of a bona fide
holder be treated as conclusive evidence of the goods being laden on board. 

2. Since endorsement of rights over bills of lading is an important aspect of
its use in carriage of goods by sea, the provisions of the said Act have extensive 
commercial applicability and is crucial to determine the transfer of rights of suit 
and liabilities to endorsees and consignees to whom any bill of lading has been 
transferred.  

3. Though  the  substantive  aspects  of  the  said  Act  continue  to  remain
relevant, being a pre-independence statute, it is imperative that the provisions of 
the said Act require to be revisited without changing the substance or spirit of the 
said Act, so as to bring it in line with modern legislations in order to facilitate 
simplification and ease of understanding. Further, a new provision is proposed to 
be incorporated to empower the Central Government to issue directions to carry 
out the provisions of the proposed legislation. 

4. Accordingly, it is proposed to repeal and reenact the said Act with a new
legislation and for the said purpose, to introduce the Bills of Lading Bill, 2024 in 
Parliament. 

5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

the same; 

10 

15 

(d) “goods” includes any property including live animals as well as 
containers, pallets or similar articles of transport or packaging supplied by 
the consignor, irrespective of whether such property is to be or is carried on 
or under deck; 

20 

        (e) “ship” means any vessel used for the carriage of goods by sea.

ARTICLE II: Risks.––Subject to the provisions of Article VI, under every

stowage, carriage, custody, care, and discharge of such goods, shall be subject to 
the  responsibilities  and  liabilities,  and  entitled  to  the  rights  and  immunities 
hereinafter set forth. 

ARTICLE  III:  Responsibilities  and  liabilities.––(1)  The  carrier  shall  be 
bound, before and at the beginning of the voyage, to exercise due diligence to — 

(a) make the ship seaworthy;

(b) properly man, equip, and supply the ship; and

30 

(c) make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts

carriage and preservation. 

(2) Subject  to  the  provisions  of  Article  IV,  the  carrier  shall  properly  and
carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods carried. 

35 

(3) After receiving the goods into his charge, the carrier, or the master or
agent of the carrier, shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of 
lading showing among other things—   

(a) the leading marks necessary for identification of the goods, as the
same  are  furnished  in  writing  by  the  shipper  before  the  loading  of  such 
goods starts, provided such marks are stamped or otherwise shown clearly

goods are contained, in such a manner as should ordinarily remain legible

40 

(b) either the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity, or weight,

be not apparent, within three days, such removal shall be prima facie evidence of 
the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading.  

(b) The notice in writing need not be given if the state of the goods has at 

the time of their receipt been the subject of joint survey or inspection. 

(c) In any event the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability 
in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year after delivery of

tallying the goods. 

(7) After the goods are loaded, the bill of lading to be issued by the carrier, 
master or agent of the carrier, to the shipper shall, if the shipper so demands, be a 
“shipped” bill of lading, provided that, if the shipper shall have previously taken 
up any document of title to such goods, he shall surrender the same as against the 
issue of the “shipped” bill of lading, but at the option of the carrier, such document 
of title may be noted at the port of shipment by the carrier, master, or agent with 
the name or names of the ship or ships upon which the goods have been shipped 
and  the  date  or  dates  of  shipment,  and  when  so  noted  the  same  shall  for  the

(8) Any clause, covenant or agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the 
carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to or in connection with goods 
arising from negligence, fault or failure in the duties and obligations provided in 
this  Article  or  lessening  such  liability  otherwise  than  as  provided  in  these

relieving the carrier from liability.

inherent defect, quality, or vice of the goods;  

(n) insufficiency of packing;  

(o) insufficiency or inadequacy of marks; 

(p) latent defects not discoverable by due diligence; 

(q) any  other cause  arising without  the actual  fault or  privity of  the 
carrier, or without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier,

exception to show that neither the actual fault nor privity of the carrier nor 
the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the 
loss or damage. 

25 

30 

35 

(3) The shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the

neglect of the shipper, his agents, or his servants. 

(4) Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea, or

per kilogram of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is higher 
or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, unless the nature and value of such 
goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill 
of lading. This declaration if embodied in the bill of lading shall be prima facie 
evidence, but shall not be binding or conclusive on the carrier. 

(b) Where a container, pallet or similar article of transport is used to consolidate
goods, the number of packages or units enumerated in the bill of lading and as packed 
in such article of transport shall be deemed to be the number of packages or units for 
the purposes of this paragraph as far as these packages or units are concerned.  

(c) Neither  the  carrier  nor  the  ship  shall  be  entitled  to  the  benefit  of
limitation of liability provided for in this paragraph if it is proved that the damage 
resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with intent to cause damage, 
or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.  

5 

10 

15

exceed the value so stated.  

(e) By agreement between the carrier, master or agent of the carrier and the
shipper, another maximum amount than that mentioned in this paragraph may be 
fixed, provided that such maximum shall not be less than the figure above named.

or damage to or in connection with goods if the nature or value thereof has been 
knowingly mis-stated by the shipper in the bill of lading.

50 

(6) (a)  Goods  of  an  inflammable,  explosive  or  dangerous  nature  to  the
shipment whereof the carrier, master or agent of the carrier, has not consented, 
with knowledge of their nature and character, may at any time before discharge 
be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without 
compensation, and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and 
expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment. 

(b) If  any  such  goods  shipped  with  such  knowledge  and  consent  shall
become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may in like manner be landed at any 
place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without liability on the 
part of the carrier except to general average, if any. 

ARTICLE  V:  Surrender  of  Rights  and  Immunities,  and  Increase  of 
Responsibilities  and  Liabilities.—A  carrier  shall  be  at  liberty  to  surrender  in 
whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any of his 
responsibilities and liabilities under the applicable rules contained in any of these 
Articles,  provided  such  surrender  or  increase  shall  be  embodied  in  the  bill  of 
lading  issued  to  the  shipper.  The  provisions of  these  applicable  rules  shall  not 
apply to charterparties, but if bills of lading are issued in the case of a ship under 
a charterparty they shall comply with the terms of these applicable rules. Nothing 
in these applicable rules shall be held to prevent the insertion in a bill of lading of 
any lawful provision regarding general average. 

ARTICLE VI : Special conditions.––Notwithstanding the provisions of the 
preceding Articles, a carrier, master or agent of the carrier, and a shipper shall, in 
regard  to  any  particular  goods be  at  liberty  to  enter  into  any  agreement  in  any 
terms to the responsibility and liability of the carrier for such goods, and as to the 
rights and immunities of the carrier in respect of such goods, or his obligation as 
to seaworthiness, so far as this stipulation is not contrary to public policy, or the 
care  or  diligence  of  his  servants  or  agents  in  regard  to  the  loading,  handling, 
stowage,  carriage,  custody,  care,  and  discharge  of  the  goods  carried  by  sea, 
provided that in this case no bill of lading has been or shall be issued and that the 
terms  agreed  shall  be  embodied  in  a  receipt  which  shall  be  a  non-negotiable 
document and shall be marked as such. Any agreement so entered into shall have 
full legal effect: 

8 

Provided that this Article shall not apply to ordinary commercial shipments 
made in the ordinary course of trade, but only to other shipments where the charter 
or  condition  of  the  property  to  be  carried  or  the  circumstances,  terms  and 
conditions under which the carriage is to be performed, are such as reasonably to 
justify a special agreement. 

5 

ARTICLE VII: Limitations on the application of the applicable rules.–– 
Nothing herein contained shall prevent a carrier or a shipper from entering into 
any  agreement,  stipulation,  condition,  reservation  or  exemption  as  to  the 
responsibility and liability of the carrier or the ship for the loss or damage to or in 
connection with the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading 
on and subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried 
by sea. 

10 

ARTICLE VIII: Limitation of liability.––The provisions of these applicable 
rules shall not affect the rights and obligations of the carrier under any statute 
for the time being in force relating to the limitation of the liability of owners of  
sea-going vessels. 

15 

ARTICLE  IX:  Gold  value.––The  monetary  units  mentioned  in  these 

applicable rules are to be taken to be gold value. 

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The Indian Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1925 (the said Act) was enacted 
to  amend  the  law  with  respect  to  carriage  of  goods  by  sea,  with  a  view  to 
establishing  the  responsibilities,  liabilities,  rights  and  immunities  attaching  to 
carriers  under  bills  of  lading.  The  said  Act  is  substantially  based  on  the 
International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to 
Bills  of  Lading  of  August  1924  (“Hague  Rules”),  which  was  amended  by  the 
Protocol signed at Brussels on 23rd February, 1968 and on 21st December, 1979 
(“Visby  Rules”).  The  Schedule  to  the  said  Act,  provided  the  Hague  Rules,  as 
amended by the Visby Rules, with modifications, to be referred to as “Rules” in 
the said Act.  

2. The said Act is applicable to outward cargo, that is, ships carrying goods
from Indian port to any other port, whether in or outside India. Every bill of lading, 
or similar document of title, issued in India, which contains or is evidence of any 
contract to which the rules apply, shall contain an express statement that it is to 
have effect subject to the provisions of the rules as applied by the said Act. 

3. Though the substantive aspects of the said Act continue to remain relevant
for maritime trade, being a pre-independence statute, it is imperative that some 
new provisions need to be incorporated therein without changing the substance or 
spirit of the said Act, so as to bring it in line with modern legislations in order to 
facilitate simplification and ease of understanding. 

4. Accordingly, it is proposed to repeal and re-enact the said Act with a
new legislation and for the said purpose, to introduce the Carriage of Goods by 
Sea Bill, 2024 in Parliament.  The salient features of the modifications proposed 
in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill, 2024, inter alia, are–– 

(a) to substitute the term “Rules” with “applicable rules”, which provides

for Hague Rules, as amended by the Visby Rules, with modifications; 

(b) to  empower  the  Central  Government  to  amend  the  Schedule  by
notification in the Official Gazette and to provide for laying of every such 
notification before Parliament; 

(c) to empower the Central Government to issue such directions as it

may deem fit to carry out all or any of the provisions of the Act; 

(d) to omit the transitional provision relating to non-applicability of
the Rules under the said Act, proposed to be repealed, to contract for the 
carriage of goods by sea before the first day of January, 1926; 

(e) to provide for necessary repeal and savings.

5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

Establishment  of  railway  network  started  as  a  branch  of  the  Public  Works 

Department before independence.  

2. When the network expanded, Indian Railways Act, 1890, was enacted to

enable proper functioning of different railway entities. 

3. As  railways  gained  popularity,  many  Princely  States  and  other  entities

came up to establish and expand railway network. 

4. Soon  it  was  realised  that  railways  need  a  structure  different  from  the

Public Works Department because of two major reasons, namely:— 

(a) First, railway is an operating organisation and therefore, it requires

flexibility and independent policy making. 

(b) Second,  railway  has  network  effect  and  therefore,  uniform

standards are needed for harmonious development. 

5. Based on the aforesaid reasons, railway organisation was separated from

the Public Works Department. The Railway Board Act, 1905 was enacted. 

6. A contemporary railway law, the Railways Act, 1989 was enacted in 1989 
by  repealing  the  Indian  Railways  Act,  1890.  That  time  itself,  the  Indian 
Railway Board  Act,  1905  could  also  have  been  merged  with  the  main  law  to 
make  it comprehensive.  

7.  The  current  Bill  proposes  to  simplify  the  legal  framework  by 
incorporating the proposals of the Indian Railway Board Act, 1905 in the Railways 
Act, 1989. This will reduce the need to refer to two laws. Instead reference will be 
required only to one law. 

8.  The  functioning  and  independence  of  Railway  Board  will  be  enhanced 
with  this  Bill.  All  the  provisions  in  the  Indian  Railway  Board  Act,  1905  are 
proposed to be incorporated in the Railways Act, 1989 through this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

The  Bill  seeks  to  repeal  the  Indian  Railway  Board  Act,  1905  by  suitably 
incorporating the provisions for constitution and composition of Railway Board into 
the Railways Act, 1989. The Railway Board is already in existence. The expenditure 
of Railway Board will continue to be met from yearly Budgetary provision under 
revenue  Budget  of  Indian  Railways  as  being  done  presently.  The  Bill  does  not 
propose  to  create  any  new  Board  or  body  resulting  in  additional  financial 
implication. 

2. The  provisions  regarding  the  terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  the
Chairman, Members of the Board, Secretary and the officers and other employees’ 
are already in place and no change is proposed in the proposed Bill. These provisions 
may result in expenditure in the discharge of statutory functions of the Government 
in regular course of business, which would be met from yearly budgetary provision 
under  revenue  segment  of  Railway’s  budget.  However,  any  additional  financial 
implication at this stage is not quantifiable.  

3. The expenditure for Railway Board proposed to be constituted as statutory
body  under  the  Railways  Act,  1989  would  continue  to  be  met  from  budgetary 
provision under revenue segment of Railway’s budget. The Budget allocation for 
the Railway Board for financial year 2024-25 is Rs. 440.01 crore under Revenue 
Head.  

5 

6 

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Sub-clause (3) of clause 3 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to 
make rules for providing the qualification, experience and terms and conditions of 
appointment of the Chairman and the other Members of the Railway Board and the 
manner of filling up the said posts. 

2. Sub-clause  (4)  of  the  said  clause  empowers  the  Central  Government  to

make rules for providing the Board with such number of Members. 

3. Sub-clause  (6)  of  the  said  clause  empowers  the  Central  Government  to
make rules for providing the terms and conditions of service of the Secretary and 
other officers and employees of the Board. 

4. The  matters  in  respect  of  which  rules  may  be  made  are  matters  of
procedure and administrative detail and it is not practicable to provide for them in 
the  Bill  itself.  The  delegation  of  Legislative  power  is,  therefore,  of  a  normal 
character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Around 50 Lakh Indians are overseas worker. More than ninety per cent. of this work 
force is in the Gulf countries.  There has been a consistent and steady increase in the number 
of  persons  going  abroad  in  search  of  employment.  There  are  about  five  million  Indians 
employed outside the country. Indian workers who migrate for work legally also face many 
problems  like  non-payment  or  delay  in  payment  of  wages,  harsh  working  and  inhuman 
living conditions, retention of passport by owners, cheating by intermediaries, incidents of 
physical abuse and sexual exploitation, etc. In most of the countries access to legal recourse 
is denied to such workers. Moreover, in some countries legal recourse is so expensive that 
in most cases employees are not able to afford such options. The Central Government is 
required  to  take  care  of  those  who  contribute  to  Indian  economy  by  sending  their  hard 
earned money to their family members in India.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a legislation providing for the management and 

welfare of Indian citizens working abroad.  The Bill, inter-alia, seeks to provide for:—

(i)  registration  of  all  Indian  citizens  who  migrate  from  the  country  in  search  of 

employment;

(ii)  entering  into  bilateral  agreement  with  other  government  of  other  nations  to 

safeguard the interest of Indian workers in those respective countries;

(iii) compulsory registration of recruitment agencies for overseas employment;

(iv) insurance and disability cover;

(v)  old  age  protection  including  pension  to  those  who  returned  to  India  in  their  

old age;

(vi) orientation and skill upgradation;

(vii)  meeting  expenditure  on  airlifting  of  mortal  remains  of  deceased  overseas 
Indians to India or for cremation/burial of such persons if the employer is unable or 
unwilling to do so and the family is unable to meet the cost;

(viii) welfare of persons who become victims of human trafficking; and

(ix) emergency medical care to overseas Indians in need and other welfare measures 

as are required to meet the needs of Indian workers abroad.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL  MEMORANDUM

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  maintenance  of  a  register  of  overseas  workers.  
Clause 4 provides for an assessment study in the countries where there are overseas Indian 
workers.  Clause  5  provides  for  formulation  and  implementation  of  welfare  schemes  for 
welfare  of  overseas  workers.    Clause  7  provides  for  constitution  of  a  Overseas Workers’ 
Welfare Fund for welfare of overseas workers. The Bill, therefore, if enacted, will involve 
expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India.  At this stage, it is difficult to give an 
exact estimate of expenditure likely to be involved as the exact amount of expenditure likely 
to be involved will depend upon the number of schemes formulated by the Government.  
However, it is estimated that an annual recurring expenditure of about rupees two thousand 
crore is likely to be involved from the Consolidated Fund of India.

A non-recurring expenditure of rupees one thousand crore is also likely to be involved.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  State  of  Tamil  Nadu  needs  assistance  from  the  Central  Government  for 
the successful completion of various schemes being undertaken at present with an 
aim to improve the standard of life of the people, improve the level of education 
and health condition of the girls, to encourage the girl students of families living 
below poverty line to pursue higher education and also to provide incentives for 
people  living  below  poverty  line  to  pursue  higher  education.  The  condition  of 
farmers and agricultural labourers in the State, their welfare and protection are of 
paramount importance. Central assistance to the State is also needed for the holistic 
development and further reduction in the maternal and infant mortality rates.

Recurring  droughts  have  made  the  State  farmers  to  seek  support  from  the 
Government.  The  situation  is  where  droughts  have  been  a  frequent  occurrence 
during the past fifty years has to be stopped through massive water conservation 
with check dams and other structures to arrest rain water run off.

The traditional methods of water conservation through digging of open wells, 
ponds,  lakes  and  such  other  bodies  and  time  to  time  desiltation  of  such  water 
bodies needs to be undertaken. Rain water harvesting has to be promoted as a mass 
movement in this region. Afforestation on a large scale particularly on barren lands 
and wastelands has to be promoted in these regions involving villagers and village 
panchayats by providing incentives. This can certainly arrest the desertification in 
these  regions.  Unfortunately  certain  backward  regions  of  the  State  are  not  much 
developed in comparison to other urban regions of the State in terms of infrastructure 
facilities such as potable water, roads, electricity, sanitation and other development 
indicators such as employment, per capita income and education particularly of the 
girl child. Welfare measures for the senior citizens, widows, physically handicapped 
or infirm do not exist in these regions of the State. Tamil Nadu has to be allocated 
its  fair  share  of  resources  by  the  Central  Government.  As  a  welfare  State,  the 
Government has to provide all these facilities and work towards giving a requisite 
push for overall and all round development of the State.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 2 of the Bill provides that there shall be paid such sums of moneys out of 
the Consolidated Fund of India, every year, as Parliament may by due appropriation 
provide, as special financial assistance to the State of Tamil Nadu to meet the costs 
of such schemes of development, as may be undertaken by the State of Tamil Nadu 
with  the  approval  of  the  Central  Government. The  Bill,  therefore,  on  enactment, 
will involve expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund of India for providing special 
financial assistance to the State of Tamil Nadu. As the sums of moneys which will 
be given to the State of Tamil Nadu as special financial assistance by appropriation 
by  law  made  by  Parliament  will  be  known  only  after  the  welfare  schemes  to  be 
implemented by the State Government are identified, it is not possible to give the 
estimates of recurring or non-recurring expenditure, which would be involved out 
of the Consolidated Fund of India at this stage.

  No non-recurring expenditure is likely to be incurred from the Consolidated Fund  
of India.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

ASHA  workers  the  accredited  social  health  activists  are  working  under 
the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare  as  part  of  National  Health  Mission 
contributing remarkable service in Health sector. The ASHA workers working as 
link between Health Department and Common man so as to create awareness and 
promote  health  activities  in  the  country.    The  contribution  of ASHA  workers  is 
helpful to improve the health standard of the country. The ASHA workers are good 
promoters of various schemes of the Central Government and State Government and 
ensuring the health of common man. The duties and service rendered by the ASHA 
workers  are  very  important  for  the  protection  of  the  health.  The ASHA  workers 
do not have job security and the honorarium given to them are not sufficient for 
meet their immediate requirement.  This may adversely affect the working of the 
integrated child development scheme.  

The ASHA workers are one of the main link between Government and general 
public. They are helping the Government for the effective implementation of health 
programmes.  Considering  the  importance  of  their  duties  and  service,  it  is  highly 
necessary to protect their service and welfare. 

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides the regularization of service of ASHA workers and 
confer the status, wages and welfare not less than the status, wages and welfare of 
Group “C” employees of the Central Government.  Clause 4 provides for provision 
of accommodation to ASHA workers. The Bill, therefore, if enacted would involve 
expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated that a recurring 
expenditure of about rupees three thousand crore per annum is likely to be incurred 
from the Consolidated Fund of India.

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees five thousand crore is also likely 

to be involved.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The framers of the Constitution of India made a giant leap of faith when they incorporated 
universal adult suffrage into the design of India’s founding document and enshrined it in 
article 326 of the Constitution.

In  1947  India’s  literacy  rate  was  only  twelve  per  cent.  in  other  words  eighty-eight  
per  cent.  of  India  was  illiterate.  What  this  decision  meant  was  that  all  Indian  citizen’s 
irrespective  of  caste,  colour,  creed,  sex,  place  of  birth  or  any  other  disability  including 
illiteracy  would  henceforth  be  qualified  to  participate  in  the  great  Indian  democratic 
experiment that was set to unfold in 1952.

With every election since 1952 our democracy has deepened and got more broad based. 
In 1988 the voting age was lowered to eighteen years. By the 73rd and 74th amendment 
to the Indian Constitution, Parliament institutionalized democracy at the third tier or at the 
grass root level.

However there remains a very serious infirmity in the functioning of India’s democratic 
model and that is the functioning of political parties that underpin our democratic edifice. The 
internal functioning and structures of an overwhelming number of these political parties are 
very opaque and ossified . There is a need to make their functioning transparent, accountable 
and rules based. At the last count there are 2858 political parties registered with the Election 
Commission of India. Out of these 8 are national parties, 54 are state parties and 2797 are 
unrecognised parties. On the 13th of August 1996 the Election Commission had issued a 
circular to all political parties registered with it whether national, state or unrecognised that 
they must hold regular elections in accordance with their respective constitution’s. Under 
Section 29-A of the Representation of People’s Act 1951 the Commission has the powers to 
register a political party but not deregister it. 

While  the  Election  Commission  of  India  has  superintendence,  direction  and  control 
of  elections  under  Part  XV  of  the  Constitution  of  India  it  has  repeatedly  argued  before 
various Courts of Law that this does not extend to the supervision or superintendence of 
internal elections and functioning of political parties. This bill seeks to provide the Election 
Commission of India with the necessary wherewithal to regulate, monitor and superintend 
the  internal  functioning  of  all  political  parties  registered  with  and  withdraw  recognition 
as national or state parties and to take such appropriate action under section 16-A of the 
Election Symbols (Reservation and allotment order) 1968 if they fail to comply with the 
directions of the Commission with regard to their internal functioning.

There is growing concern with regard to the independence and autonomy of the Election 
Commission. To maintain the impartiality and integrity of the Commission, it has become 
imperative that the Chief Election Commission and such other Election Commissioners as 
are deemed necessary be appointed by a Panel consisting of the Prime Minister of India, 
Union  Home  Minister,  Leader  of  Opposition  or  Floor  Leader  in  Lok  Sabha,  Leader  of 
Opposition or Floor Leader in Rajya Sabha and Chief Justice of India and two senior most 
puisne judges of the Supreme Court of India.

It is also pertinent that the Chief Election Commissioner, Election Commissioners shall 
be given a fixed term of six years and the Regional Commissioners fixed term of three years 
from the dates of their respective appointments. They should not be removed from office 
except  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  laid  down  for  the  removal  of  a  Supreme  Court 
Judge. Also, after retirement they should not be eligible for any reappointment to any office 
under the Government of India, State Governments and the Constitution.

This is the second wave of Democratic Reforms that India requires.

The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The price of glucose test strips in India exhibits significant variation due to multiple 
factors  such  as  brand,  quality,  availability,  distribution  channels,  and  regional  economic 
conditions. Typically, the cost of glucose test strips ranges from ₹300 to ₹1,500 for a pack 
of 50 strips, but this can fluctuate based on several key determinants. 

Firstly,  brand  reputation  plays  a  crucial  role  in  pricing.  Established  brands  like  
Accu-Chek,  OneTouch,  and  Dr.  Morepen  generally  command  higher  prices  due  to  their 
perceived  reliability  and  widespread  recognition.  These  brands  often  invest  heavily  in 
research  and  development,  ensuring  accuracy  and  consistency  in  their  products,  which 
justifies  the  premium  pricing.  Conversely,  lesser-known  or  generic  brands  offer  more 
affordable  options,  though  they  may  lack  the  same  level  of  trust  and  reliability  among 
consumers. 

Secondly, the quality and features of the test strips impact their cost. Strips that offer 
advanced  features  such  as  faster  reading  times,  smaller  blood  sample  requirements,  and 
compatibility with mobile apps or data management systems tend to be priced higher. These 
features  cater  to  users  looking  for  convenience  and  more  integrated  health  management 
solutions. 

Availability and distribution channels also influence prices. In urban areas with numerous 
pharmacies and healthcare providers, competition can drive prices down. However, in rural 
or  remote  areas  where  access  to  medical  supplies  is  limited,  prices  might  be  higher  due 
to  logistical  challenges  and  reduced  competition.  Online  marketplaces  like Amazon  and 
Flipkart  often  offer  competitive  pricing  and  discounts,  potentially  lower  than  brick-and-
mortar stores, due to reduced overhead costs and bulk purchasing advantages. 

Regional  economic  conditions  and  government  policies  further  affect  pricing.  States 
with  better  healthcare  infrastructure  and  higher  purchasing  power  may  see  lower  prices 
due to economies of scale and better supply chain management. Additionally, government 
initiatives to make healthcare more affordable, such as subsidies or price controls on essential 
medical supplies, can also help in stabilizing or reducing the cost of glucose test strips. 

Therefore,  this  Bill  aims  to  address  the  disparities  in  the  availability  and  pricing  of 
glucotest  strips  across  India.  By  establishing  uniform  standards,  regulating  prices,  and 
providing  subsidies  to  low-income  groups,  the  Bill  seeks  to  make  diabetes  management 
more  accessible  and  affordable.  The  increasing  prevalence  of  diabetes  necessitates  such 
measures to ensure the well-being of the affected population.

Hence, this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  5  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  establishment  of  a  Committee  to  regulate  and 
monitor the prices of glucotest strips in the country. Clause 10 of the Bill provides for the 
Central Government to provide necessary funds for carrying out the purpose of this Act. 
The Bill, therefore, if enacted and brought into operation will involve expenditure from the 
Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated that a sum of rupees two thousand crore, may be 
involved as recurring expenditure per annum.

Non recurring expenditure to the tune of rupees two thousand crore may also involve 

from the Consolidated Fund of India.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) 
is  a  flagship  programme  of  the  Government  of  India  aimed  at  providing  employment  to 
rural  households  in  the  country. The  success  of  the  programme  depends  on  the  efficient 
functioning of its employees. However, person employed under the  MGNREGS are often 
subject to payment delays, technological impositions, and paucity of funds, which affect 
their efficiency and morale.

The  need  is  to  protect  the  persons  employed  under  the  MGNREGS  from  payment 
delays, technological imposition, and paucity of funds. It is the responsibility of the Central 
Government and the State Governments concerned to take necessary steps to ensure that 
the persons employed under the MGNREGS are paid their wages on time, technological 
changes and innovations are not imposed on the employees without proper consultation and 
training, and there is no paucity of funds for the implementation of MGNREGS. It is also 
required to have a requisite penalty for non-compliance for timely payment to the persons 
employed under the MGNREGS.

The Bill therefore, seeks to amend the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment 
Guarantee Act, 2005 with a view to put an obligation on the Central Government and the 
State  Governments  for  the  timely  payment  of  wages  to  the  persons  employed  under  the 
Scheme, etc.

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The non-formal schooling and early childhood care is predominantly in private sector. 
The play schools have mushroomed all over the country, especially in urban areas. They 
are being governed by laws relating to Establishment of Shops of the concerned States. The 
early days of kids are spent in these schools as many parents are now putting their kids in 
these schools as early as one year of age. Foundation of mental and physical development 
of little children is laid in play schools. Play school now-a-days has become a big business 
opportunity.  In  the  absence  of  any  legislative  check,  complaints  of  parents  and  non-
Governmental Organisations are not addressed by these schools. As play schools are laying 
foundation of a child’s future, they should not be governed by any business Act but by an 
education Act. 

The Bill, therefore, seeks to regulate the functioning of play schools in the country not 
only to ensure quality education and guidance in play schools, but also to protect the parents 
from unnecessary exploitation.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM           

Clause 3 of the Bill provides that the appropriate Government shall, within its territorial 
jurisdiction, constitute Play Schools Education Authority to regulate the functioning of the 
play schools. The expenditure relating to the States shall be borne out of the Consolidated 
Funds of the respective States. However, the expenditure in respect of Union territories shall 
be borne out of the Consolidated Fund of India. The Bill, therefore, if enacted, will involve 
expenditure  from  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  India.  It  is  estimated  that  sum  of  rupees  one 
crore will be involved as recurring expenditure per annum from the Consolidated Fund of 
India. 

A non-recurring expenditure to the tune of rupees ten lakh is also likely to be involved.

and 10B.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 aims to provide for 
facilitating  the  promotion  and  development  and  enhancing  the  competitiveness  of  micro, 
small and medium enterprises in the country. The said Act, as well as the guidelines issued 
by the Reserve Bank of India in its circular dated 1st July, 2011 and the recommendations 
of various committees and task groups have brought about considerable positive changes in 
various areas of development of competitiveness of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
(MSMEs). 

However, the MSMEs, that contribute to nine per cent. of the country’s Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP), forty-five per cent. of the manufactured output, forty per cent. of our exports 
and that employs an estimated ten million people, continue to face serious bottlenecks in its 
development. Lack of access to adequate and timely credit at a reasonable cost is the most 
critical problems faced by this sector. Hence, there is an urgent need to make it mandatory 
by law for scheduled commercial banks to provide affordable lending rates to MSMEs. 

The Bill, hence, aims to ensure lowest lending rates to MSMEs, fixed at one per cent. 
plus the rate of interest for fixed deposits of the scheduled commercial banks in the country. 
This would ensure more credit flow to the MSME sector, without hurting commercial banks, 
as they will continue to have freedom to fix lending rates to other sectors or units. The Bill 
also aims to make it mandatory for scheduled commercial banks to offer MSMEs, collateral 
free loans, up to rupees two crore. These two key changes in the principal Act would revive 
MSMEs through increased credit flow.

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Anganwadi Centres were started in this country by the Central Government and State 
Governments for implementation of the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme. 
It includes the comprehensive development of health awareness among women and child 
welfare.  The contribution of Anganwadi Centres is remarkable and has become an integrated 
and  essential  part  of  life  in  rural  areas.  The Anganwadi  workers  are  good  promoters  of 
various schemes of the Central Government and State Government and ensuring the health 
and welfare of child and women. The duties and service rendered by the Anganwadi workers 
are  very  important  for  the  protection  of  the  health  and  welfare  of  women  and  children. 
The Anganwadi  workers  do  not  have  job  security  and  the  honorarium  given  to  them  are 
not  sufficient  to  meet  their  immediate  basic  requirements. This  may  adversely  affect  the 
working of the Integrated Child Development Scheme.  

The Anganwadi workers are one of the main links between Government and general 
public. They are helping the Government for the effective implementation of women and 
children health and welfare scheme. Considering the importance of their duties and service 
it is highly necessary to protect their service and welfare. 

Hence this Bill.

New Delhi;                                                                                         N. K. PREMACHANDRAN

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for regularisation of the services of anganwadi workers 
and confer the status not less than those of Group ‘C’ employees of the Central Government 
on all such anganwadi workers. It also provides for such wages and welfare measures as are 
available to or not less than Group ‘C’ employees of the Central Government to anganwadi 
workers. The Bill, therefore, if enacted would involve expenditure from the consolidated 
Fund of India. A recurring expenditure of about rupees three thousand crore is likely to be 
involved per annum from the Consolidated Fund of India.

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees three thousand crore is also likely to be 

involved.

STATEMENT  OF  OBJECTS  AND  REASONS

Sanskrit, the mother of all Indo-Aryan languages, which has also helped in development 
and enrichment of almost all languages across the globe is fighting a tough battle in its own 
country of origin i.e. India. The language, acknowledged and documented to be the most 
structured and scientific language in the entire world, and which was once the lingua-franca, 
has now been reduced to a vanishing minority with just about 14,000 speakers left, across  
a country of over 1.2 billion population. 

India's  official  education  policy  specifically  mentions  that  facilities  for  the  intensive 
study of Sanskrit have to be encouraged. Still, the apathy, neglect and propaganda against 
Sanskrit went on to such an extent that the Supreme Court of India had to intervene in 1994 
to declare that Sanskrit had to be a part of education. However, the various States of India 
are still disadvantaging, discouraging and discriminating with teaching of Sanskrit language 
at school, college and University level. 

It  is  absolutely  essential  that  Sanskrit  be  taught  as  language  in  all  schools  and 
institutions of higher learning. State must ensure that institutions of higher learning produce 
good Sanskrit teachers and that all vacancies of Sanskrit teachers in schools are filled-up 
immediately. It is highly deplorable that such a language which has a vast literature is being 
neglected in its own country. 

It  is  high  time  now  to  make  sincere  efforts  to  increase  awareness  in  the  younger 
generation about the importance of Sanskrit. Teaching of Sanskrit as a compulsory language 
in schools at least upto eighth standard will enable the younger generation to enrich their 
personality and to be aware of the noble traditions and thoughts of India which would help 
them become better citizens.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 5 of the Bill provides that the total expenditure incurred on teaching of Sanskrit 
as a compulsory language in every school upto eighth standard shall be borne equally by 
the Central Government and the State Governments. The Bill, therefore, if enacted, would 
involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. Although, the exact amount of 
expenditure cannot  be  estimated,  however,  it  is  estimated that  a  recurring  expenditure of 
about twenty crore rupees per annum is likely to be involved from the Consolidated Fund 
of India. 

No non-recurring expenditure is likely to be involved.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

Intelligence  agencies  are  responsible  for  maintaining  internal  security  and  combating 

external threats to the sovereignty and integrity of the nation.  These responsibilities range from 

counter-terrorism  measures  tackling  separatist  movements  to  critical  infrastructure  protection.  

These agencies are operating without an appropriate statutory basis delineating their functioning 

and  operations.    This  tends  to,  among  other  things,  compromise  operational  efficiency  and 

weakens  the  professional  fabric  of  these  agencies.    It  also  results  in  intelligence  officers  not 

having due protection when performing their duties. 

Assessments and gathering of information by intelligence agencies are catalysts for law 

enforcement  units  to  act,  necessitating  that  these  be  reliable,  accurate  and  in  accordance  with 

law.  This kind of efficiency has been hindered by obscured responsibilities that have plagued the 

functioning of the agencies. 

Article  21  of  the  Constitution  provides  that  no  person  shall  be  deprived  of  his  life  and 

personal  liberty  except  according to  the  procedure established  by  law.    The  Supreme  Court  of 

India  has  carved  a  right  to  privacy  from  the  right  to  life  and  personal  liberty.    Such  rights  to 

privacy  are  compromised  when  agencies  undertake  surveillance  operations.    In  Re:  Peoples 

Union  of  Civil  Liberties  v.  Union  of  India,  the  Supreme  Court  issued  detailed  guidelines 

regarding  telephone tapping.    A  proper  legal  framework  is  required  to  regulate  surveillance  of 

other  forms,  using  different  technologies,  as  well.    There  is  an  urgent  need  to  balance  the 

demands  of  security  and  privacy  of  individuals,  by  ensuring  safeguards  against  the  misuse  of 

surveillance powers of intelligence agencies.  Therefore, legislation is imperative to regulate the 

possible infringement of privacy of citizens, while giving credence to security concerns. 

In view of the reasons stated, the Bill seeks to enact a legislation pursuant to Entry 8 of 

List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India to provide: - 

(a) 

A legislative and regulatory framework for the Intelligence Bureau, the Research 

and Analysis Wing and the National Technical Research Organisation; 

…2/- 

 
 
 
 
 
 
-2-  

(b) 

Designated  Authority  regarding  authorization  procedure  and  system  of  warrants 

for operations by these agencies; 

(c)   A National Intelligence Tribunal for the investigation of complaints against these 

agencies. 

(d) 

A  National  Intelligence  and  Security  Oversight  Committee  for  an  effective 

oversight mechanism of these agencies; and 

(e) 

An  Intelligence  Ombudsman  for  efficient  functioning  of  the  agencies  and  for 

matters connected therewith. 

The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objectives.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the constitution of a Research and Analysis Wing under the 

control  of  the  Prime  Minister.  Clause  4  provides  for  the  establishment  of  an  Intelligence  Bureau 

under the control of the Prime Minister. Clause 5 provides for appointment of a Director for day-to-

day operation of the  IB.  Clause 6 provides for the establishment of a National Technical Research 

Organisation  under  the  control  of  the  Prime  Minister.  Clause  7  provides  for  appointment  of  a 

Chairman in whom shall be vested the day-to-day operations of the NTRO.  Clause 12 provides for 

the  constitution  of  a  National  Intelligence  and  Security  Oversight  Committee  to  examine  and 

administer and ensure compliance of the policies laid down under the Act. Clause 16 provides that an 

Intelligence  Ombudsman  shall  be  appointed  by  the  Central  Government.  Clause  21  provides  for 

remedies including compensation to the persons aggrieved by the actions of the intelligence agencies. 

Clause  23  provides  that  a  National  Intelligence  Tribunal  shall  be  established  by  the  Central 

Government. Clause 24 provides  for appointment of  the  Chairperson  and members  of  the Tribunal. 

Clause 28 provides for salaries and other expenses of the Chairperson and members of the Tribunal. 

Clause 30 provides for the staff for the effective functioning of the Tribunal. Clause 34 provides for 

the payment of compensation to the persons who have suffered loss by any action of the R&AW or 

the IB or the NTRO.   

The Bill, therefore, if enacted, will involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India.  

It  is  estimated  that  sum  of  rupees  ten  thousand  crore  will  be  involved  as  recurring  expenditure  per 

annum.  

A non-recurring expenditure to the tune of rupees five hundred crore is also likely to be incurred 

from the Consolidated Fund of India. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 36  of  the Bill  gives power to the  Central  Government to make  rules for  carrying out the 

purposes of the Bill. As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, the delegation of legislative power is 

of  a  normal character.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Air pollution is a growing concern across India, with the adverse effects of air pollution 
on  human  health  and  the  environment  becoming  increasingly  evident.  The  emission  of 
greenhouse gases from various human activities is contributing to climate change, which 
poses a significant threat to the planet.

The proposed Bill seeks to address these issues by promoting clean air, better air quality, 
and  encouraging  the  adoption  of  green  practices  in  various  sectors  of  the  economy.  The 
need is also to establish a National Clean Air Plan, which will be implemented by the State 
Governments in a time-bound manner. The National Clean Air Plan shall include measures 
to reduce emissions from polluting industries and transportation sectors, promote the use of 
clean energy sources, electric vehicles, and public transport, and encourage the use of non-
motorized transport such as cycling and walking.

The proposed Bill also aims to establish a network of air quality monitoring stations 
across the country and the data from these stations will be made available to the public in 
real-time. The State Governments will be required to take necessary measures to ensure that 
the air quality meets the standards set by the Central Pollution Control Board.

The Bill further encourages industries to adopt green practices by providing incentives 
such as tax breaks and subsidies. The State Governments will also be required to impose 
penalties on polluting industries that violate the permissible limits of air pollutants.

The  Bill  seeks  to  promote  the  use  of  public  transport  by  providing  incentives  such 
as reduced fares and promoting the use of electric vehicles in public transport. The State 
Governments  will  also  be  required  to  promote  the  use  of  non-motorized  transport  such 
as  cycling  and  walking  by  providing  infrastructure  such  as  cycle  tracks  and  pedestrian 
walkways.

The  Bill,  therefore,  seeks  to  amend  the  Air  (Prevention  and  Control  of  Pollution)                
Act,  1981  with  a  view  to  establish  National  Clean Air  Plan  and Air  Quality  monitoring 
Stations to promote clean air, better air quality, and encourage the adoption of green practices 
across various sectors of the economy. By doing so, it aims to contribute towards a healthier 
and more sustainable future for India.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  vide    proposed  section  19B  provides  for  the  Central  Pollution 
Control Board to establish a network of air quality monitoring stations across the country in 
such manner as may be prescribed. The Bill, therefore, if enacted would involve expenditure 
from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated that a recurring expenditure of about 
rupees eight thousand and five hundred crore is likely to be involved per annum from the 
Consolidated Fund of India. 

A non-recurring expenditure of rupees seven hundred crore is also likely to be involved.

Shri Shrirang Appa Barne, M.P.

A

BILL

to provide for compulsory military training in schools and other educational institutions

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The Bill seeks to introduce compulsory military training in schools and other educational 
institutions to foster discipline, physical fitness, national unity, and a sense of preparedness 
among  the  youth.  This  initiative  aims  to  imbue  students  with  essential  life  skills  and  a 
deeper  understanding  of  national  security  and  defense  mechanisms.  Through  structured 
military training, it is sought to create a disciplined, aware, and resilient generation ready to 
contribute positively to the nation’s progress and security. 

Compulsory  military  training  in  schools  and  other  educational  institutions  in  India 
could  be  advocated  for  several  reasons,  but  it  is  also  important  to  consider  the  potential 
drawbacks and the complexity of implementation. 

Military training instills a sense of discipline, responsibility, and respect for authority, 
which can positively influence students’ personal and academic lives and regular physical 
training can improve students’ health, fitness levels, and overall well-being. It can also help 
combat the growing issue of sedentary lifestyles and obesity. 

Military  training  can  foster  a  sense  of  patriotism  and  national  pride.  Understanding 
the sacrifices made by armed forces can enhance students’ respect for their country and its 
values with Students can acquire various skills such as leadership, teamwork, survival skills, 
and crisis management, which are valuable in both personal and professional contexts. 

Military training can prepare students to respond effectively in emergency situations, 
such  as  natural  disasters,  by  equipping  them  with  basic  first  aid  and  survival  skills  and 
exposure  to  military  training  can  open  up  career  opportunities  in  the  defense  sector  and 
related fields. It can also help students make informed decisions about pursuing a career 
in the armed forces. Shared experiences in training can build camaraderie and break down 
social barriers among students from diverse backgrounds, promoting social cohesion and 
mutual respect. 

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

It  is  estimated  that  more  than  ten  lakh  tonnes  of  waste  is  generated  in  our  country.  
The waste is largely composed of bio wastes, metals, plastics, paper, food, glass and presently 
majority of the waste is sent to the landfills with only a portion being used in waste-energy 
plants or recycled or reused. For this every municipal corporation should be provided with 
incinerators of different capacities depending upon the waste generated. This energy from 
waste can be used as an alternative to the depleting petroleum products and it would also 
keep the environment safe and clean. Waste is not a waste until it is wasted. 

The Bill seeks to ensure that waste from landfills is segregated and recycled, reused as 
input to waste-energy projects. Non-recyclable wastes and hazardous wastes can be dumped 
in  the  notified  landfills.  Proper  handling  and  disposal  of  municipal  waste  could  result  in 
generating employment and serve as an opportunity for entrepreneurs in the waste-energy 
sector. In various countries there are laws for proper disposal of wastes.

Hence this Bill.

Clause 4 of the Bill provides for certain steps to be taken by the municipal authorities

waste-energy plants and non-recyclable waste to the notified landfills. 

Clause 6 of the Bill provides that the Central Government shall provide requisite funds 
to  State  Governments  to  carry  out  the  purposes  of  this Act.  The  Bill,  if  enacted,  would 
involve  expenditure  from  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  India.  It  is  estimated  that  a  sum  of

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  State  of  Tamil  Nadu  is  one  of  the  most  favourite  destinations  of  tourists,  both 
domestic and foreign, famous for its rich ancient architecture, art, culture and tradition, fairs 
and  festivals  worldwide.  The  different  tourist  destinations  attract  the  tourists  because  of 
various reasons including its ancient and historical monuments and archaeological sites and 
remains.

At  present,  the Archaeological  Survey  of  India  is  looking  after  the  maintenance  and 
conservation of 242 centrally protected monuments/sites in the State of Tamil Nadu. Besides 
more than 500 monuments and buildings have been notified as  protected monuments in the 
State of Tamil Nadu. These monuments and archaeological remains of diverse nature are 
located in the region since prehistoric times and are scattered from the Palaeolithic site at 
Gudiyam in Tiruvallur District to the Microlithic or Mesolithic sites in Teri Sand in Southern 
districts of Tirunelveli and Thuthukudi. There are splendid array of Megalithic monuments, 
pre-historic and historic monuments, the exquisite stone architecture of the Pallavas, Cholas, 
Pandiyas and the Nayaks. There are hundreds of archaic buildings constructed during the rule 
of Nawabs of Arcot and the British. The great repertoire of ancient monuments and plethora 
of  ancient  temples  makes  Tamil  Nadu  the  greatest  treasure  of  ancient  world.  The  grand 
Vellore Fort and the Jalakandeswarar temple complex situated in my Vellore Parliamentary 
constituency is world renowned and attracts great attention.

Taking care of the monuments is an important duty that devolves on the respective State 
Government as well as the Central Government. It needs adequate funds to engage people 
who can look after monuments, ensure that the miscreants do not harm them, as also to get 
the damaged portion repaired from expert designers and engineers. The Central Government 
must provide adequate funds for each monument.

The  proper  upkeep  and  maintenance  of  ancient  and  historical  monuments  and 
archaeological  sites  and  remains  in  the  State  of Tamil  Nadu  shall  boost  heritage  tourism 
which  will  in  turn  increase  employment,  revenue  generation  and  local  business  in  
Tamil Nadu.

It  is,  therefore,  necessary  that  the  Central  Government  should  provide  special 
financial  assistance  to  the  State  of  Tamil  Nadu  to  meet  the  costs  of  repairs,  renovations 
and preservation of ancient and historical monuments and archaeological sites and remains 
including  excavation  of  new  archaeological  sites  and  remains  situated  in  the  State  of  
Tamil Nadu.

 Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides that there shall be paid such sums of money out of the 
Consolidated Fund of India, every year, as Parliament may by due appropriation provide, 
as  special  financial  assistance  to  the  State  of  Tamil  Nadu  to  meet  the  costs  of  repairs, 
renovations and preservation of ancient and historical monuments and archaeological sites 
and  remains  including  excavation  of  new  archaeological  sites  and  remain  situated  in  the 
State of Tamil Nadu, as may be undertaken by the State with the approval of the Government 
of India.

The Bill, therefore, on enactment, will involve expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund 
of India. As the sums of moneys which will be given to the State of Tamil Nadu as special 
financial assistance by appropriation by law made by Parliament will be known only after 
the plans to be implemented by the State Government with the approval of Government of 
India are identified, it is not possible at present to give the estimates of recurring expenditure, 
which would be involved out of the Consolidated Fund of India at this stage.

commencement.

Insertion of new 
section 3A.

Establishment 
of 
All  India  Institute  of 
Medical  Sciences  at 
Palakkad  in the State 
of Kerala.

 
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

It has been a long pending of the people of Kerala to establish an All India Institute of 

Medical Sciences in Kerala.

The Union Government has so far sanctioned 22 All India Institutes of Medical Sciences 
(AIIMS) under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) across the country, but 
sorry to note that not a single such institution has been sanctioned for the State of Kerala and 
it is an injustice or discrimination towards the people of Kerala and against the spirit of our 
Constitution which provides equality to all.

Generally,  the  people  of  Kerala  are  very  health  conscious,  but  not  now,  from  time 
immemorial.  However,  the  new  diseases  one  after  the  other,  further  accelerated  their 
consciousness on health, and therefore, there is always a huge rush in all government-run 
hospitals which are the only source for the poor people.

The two deadly viruses were first detected in the State of Kerala i.e. Nipah outbreak 
in  the  year  2018  and  the  Covid-19  in  the  year  2020  and  on  both  the  occasions  the 
Union Government had to depute a central team to take control of the situation, and therefore, 
such an institution like AIIMS is a must in the State of Kerala, to tackle such a situation, if 
arises in the future, in addition to providing world-class treatment. Recently cases of Nipah 
and Zika viruses were reported in Kerala.

While I demand to set up an AIIMS in the State of Kerala, I recommend a place for the 
same, which is Palakkad. Palakkad would be an ideal place as such an institution at Palakkad 
will fill the gaps in tertiary healthcare infrastructure in this part of Kerala, since Palakkad 
lacks healthcare infrastructure is not matching with the other places, the people of Palakkad 
district now have to undertake a journey ranging from 60 kms. to 120 kms. to get treatment 
from specialty hospitals located at either Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode or Coimbatore.

Therefore, looking into the gaps in tertiary healthcare infrastructure in the district of 

Palakkad, I urge upon the government to establish an AIIMS at Palakkad in Kerala.

Hence this Bill.

Sciences at Palakakd in the State of Kerala. The Bill, therefore, if enacted would involve  
expenditure  from  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  India.  It  is  estimated  that  an  expenditure  of  
about rupees 50 crore would be incurred per annum from the Consolidated Fund of India. 

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees one thousand crore is likely to be involved.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

India resides in villages and eighty-five per cent. of its rural population earns its livelihood 
from agriculture. There are cultivators, orchard owners, poultry owners, agricultural workers 
and home based workers in the rural areas. Their number runs into crores. However, their 
wages and income are meagre and many of them do not get employment throughout the 
year. These rural labourers also become an easy prey to the debt trap of the landlords and 
moneylenders who force them to become bonded labourers. Most of them remain very poor 
throughout their lives and live in distress for generations. In a welfare State like ours, there 
are no welfare schemes or funds for these helpless rural labourers whereas in the industrial 
sector there are Labour Welfare Boards and cess is levied and collected through legislative 
measures  in  order  to  provide  them  various  amenities  including  housing,  education  and 
medical care. But the rural labourers are unorganized, poverty stricken and neglected, even 
by the State.

It is, therefore, necessary that the deteriorating plight of rural workers be felt at national 
level  and  the  Central  Government  should  constitute  a  Rural  Labour  Welfare  Fund  for 
financing adequately and systematically the welfare measures to be carried out for the rural 
and agricultural labour throughout the country so as to achieve the goals of a welfare State 
in its true sense.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the constitution of the Rural Labour Welfare Fund. 
Clause  5  provides  for  the  constitution  of  Advisory  Committees.  Clause  6  provides  for 
constitution  of  a  Central  Advisory  Committee.  Clause  7  provides  for  appointment  of 
Rural  Labour  Welfare  Commissioners,  Inspectors  and  officers  and  staff  for  carrying  out 
the purposes of this Bill. The Bill, therefore, if enacted, will involve expenditure from the 
Consolidated Fund of India but it is not possible at this stage to give the precise details of the 
expenditure that would be involved. It is, however, estimated that it will involve a recurring 
expenditure of about rupees two hundred crore per annum.

It will also involve a non-recurring expenditure of about rupees sixty lakh.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause 9 of the Bill provides that the Central Government may make rules for carrying 
out the purposes of this Bill. As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, the delegation 
of legislative power is of a normal character.

STATEMENT	OF	OBJECTS	AND	REASONS

Life	is	impossible	without	water.	All	living	beings	including	human,	animals	and	plants	
need	 water	 for	 their	 survival.	 Therefore,	 it	 is	 desirable	 that	 requisite	 amount	 of	 water	 is	
available	without	any	hindrance	for	drinking	and	irrigation.	

Around	ninety-seven	per	cent	of	the	water	on	the	Earth	is	salty	water	and	only	three	
per	cent	is	fresh	water;	slightly	over	two	thirds	of	this	fresh	water	is	frozen	in	the	form	of	
glaciers	and	polar	ice	caps.	The	remaining	unfrozen	fresh	water	is	found	mainly	as	ground	
water. 

Ground	water	is	a	renewable	resource,	yet	the	world’s	supply	of	ground	water	is	steadily	
decreasing	with	the	depletion	of	water	table,	most	prominently	in	Asia	and	North	America.	
It	 is	 still	 not	 clear	 that	 how	 much	 natural	 renewal	 balance	 of	 fresh	 water	 is	 available	 or	
whether	ecosystem	will	be	threatened	for	want	of	fresh	water	in	near	future.	The	framework	
for	allocating	water	resources	to	water	users	where	such	a	framework	exists	is	known	as	
water	rights.	

At	present,	water	is	a	State	subject	and	is	considered	as	primary	responsibility	of	the	

State	Governments.	

The	 Bill	 seeks	 to	 amend	 that	 Seventh	 Schedule	 to	 the	 Constitution	 with	 a	 view	 to	
transfer	entry	17	of	List	II-State	List	pertaining	to	‘Water’,	to	List	III-Concurrent	List	so	
that	the	Parliament	and	the	Central	Government	can	also	play	their	due	role	for	conservation	

and	sustainable	use	of	water	to	meet	the	growing	needs	of	the	society.

Hence	this	Bill.

BILL

further to  amend  the  Constitution of  India.

B(cid:3454) it enacted by Parliament in the Seventy-fifth Year of the Republic of India as follows:—

1. This Act may be called the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 2024. 

Short title.

2. In article 80 of the Constitution, in clause (5), the following proviso shall be added 

at the end, namely:—

Amendment of 
article 80.

“Provided  that  the  representative  of  the  Union  territory  of  Chandigarh  in  the 
Council of States shall be elected by an electoral college consisting of elected members 
of the Municipal  Corporation of Chandigarh constituted under  the Punjab Municipal 
Corporation (Extension to Chandigarh) Act, 1994.”.

 
 
Amendment 
of the Fourth 
Schedule.

3. In the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, in the Table—

(a) after entry 31, the following entry shall be inserted, namely:—

“32. 

Chandigarh………………... 

1”;

(b) for the figures “233”, the figures “234” shall be substituted.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Article  79  of  the  Constitution  provides  for  the  Constitution  of  Parliament.  Article 
80  stipulates  the  Composition  of  the  Council  of  States.  Article  80  (5)  states  that  the 
representatives of the (Union territories) in the Council  of States shall be chosen  in such 
manner as Parliament may by law prescribe. The words “States specified in Part C of the 
First Schedule” were omitted and replaced by Union territories by section 3 (1) (d) of the 
Constitution  (Seventh) Amendment Act  1956  with  effect  from  the  1st  day  of  November, 
1956.

The  Union  territories  of  Puducherry,  Jammu  and  Kashmir  and  the  National  Capital 
territory of Delhi find representation in the Council of States. While the Union territories 
of Ladakh, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli – Daman and Diu, Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands and Lakshadweep are unrepresented in the Council of States.

A special law in terms of article 80 (5) of the Constitution therefore needs to be enacted 
to  provide  representation  to  the  unrepresented  Union  territories  in  the  Council  of  States. 
The proposed Bill is however specific to providing representation to the Union territory of 
Chandigarh in the Council of  States.

The Bill provides that one person shall be elected to the Council of States from 
Chandigarh. Just as the Delhi Metropolitan Council served as the  electoral college 
for  electing  three  persons  to  the  Council  of  States  from  Delhi  from  1966  to  1990, 
similarly it is proposed that an electoral college consisting of the elected members of 
the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh as brought into existence by an Ordinance, 
namely,  the  Punjab  Municipal  Corporation Act, 1976 as  extended  to Union territory 
Chandigarh  by  the  Punjab  Municipal  Corporation  Law  (Extension  to  Chandigarh) 
Ordinance, 1994 and promulgated by the President of the India with effect from the 
24th day of May, 1994 bringing the said Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh into 
existence,  shall  for  the  purposes  of  providing  representation  to  Chandigarh  in  the 
Council of States  constitute the electoral college for the  same.

The said ordinance was replaced by the Punjab Municipal Corporation Law (Extension 
to Chandigarh) Act, 1994 as  further  amended by the Punjab  Municipal  Corporation  Law 
(Extension to Chandigarh) Amendment Act, 2017.

The  Bill  seeks  to  amend  the  Constitution  with  a  view  to  provide  one  seat  to  Union 
territory of Chandigarh in the Council of States. The representative would be elected by an 
electoral college consisting of elected members of the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh 
constituted under the Punjab Municipal Corporation (Extension to Chandigarh) Act, 1994.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for allocation of one seat in the Council of States to the 
Union territory of Chandigarh. The Bill, therefore, if enacted, would involve expenditure 
from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is likely to involve an annual recurring expenditure 
of about rupees two lakhs from the Consolidated Fund of India.

No non-recurring expenditure is likely to be involved.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Transparency and accountability in the collection and utilization of income tax in India 
is  required  to  be  done.  By  providing  a  visual  representation  of  collected  income  tax,  the 
proposed  Bill  aims  to  make  tax  data  more  accessible  and  understandable  to  the  general 
public,  thus  fostering  greater  trust  in  the  tax  system.  Furthermore,  it  seeks  to  educate 
taxpayers and encourage a more informed and engaged citizenry. 

In  recent  years,  transparency  and  accountability  have  become  crucial  elements  in 
governance, particularly concerning the collection and utilization of public funds. This Bill 
addresses the need for greater clarity in how income taxes are collected and spent by the 
government. Transparency is pivotal in ensuring that taxpayers know exactly where their 
contributions are going and how they are being used to benefit society. By mandating the 
creation of a visual representation of income tax data, the Bill aims to demystify the tax 
system and make information more readily available to all citizens. 

The  visual  representation  aspect  of  this  Bill  is  a  significant  step  forward.  Numbers 
and  statistics,  while  informative,  can  often  be  overwhelming  or  incomprehensible  to  the 
average  person.  By  translating  these  figures  into  easily  digestible  charts,  graphs,  and 
infographics, the government can convey complex information in a more straightforward 
and  engaging  manner.  This  approach  not  only  aids  in  understanding  but  also  highlights 
key areas where tax revenue is being utilized, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, 
and defense. When taxpayers see a clear and direct correlation between their contributions 
and the improvements in their community or country, it fosters a sense of ownership and 
responsibility towards the nation’s development. 

One of the primary goals of this Bill is to build and sustain trust between the government 
and its citizens. Taxation is often seen as a burden, and the lack of visible impact can lead to 
skepticism and reluctance to comply. By implementing transparent measures and providing 
clear, visual insights into the collection and spending of income tax, the government can 
demonstrate  its  commitment  to  integrity  and  responsible  governance.  This,  in  turn,  can 
lead to higher compliance rates and a more robust tax base, as citizens are more likely to 
contribute when they trust that their money is being used effectively and ethically. 

Beyond  transparency,  this  Bill  places  a  strong  emphasis  on  education.  It  recognizes 
that an informed taxpayer is a crucial asset to the nation. By making tax data accessible and 
understandable, the Bill aims to educate citizens about the importance of taxes in Nation 
building. Educational campaigns and resources, alongside visual data representations, can 
help demystify the tax process, elucidate the various facets of income tax, and highlight the 
significance  of  timely  and  accurate  tax  payments.  Such  education  can  empower  citizens, 
making them more knowledgeable about their fiscal responsibilities and the impact of their 
contributions on national development. 

An informed citizenry is more likely to be engaged and participative in the democratic 
process. By providing clear, visual tax data and educational resources, this Bill encourages 
citizens to take a more active role in civic life. When people understand how their taxes are 
collected and used, they are better equipped to hold their government accountable, advocate 
for necessary changes, and participate in policy discussions. This engagement can lead to 
more  responsive  governance  and  policies  that  better  reflect  the  needs  and  desires  of  the 
populace.

5

For  the  successful  implementation  of  this  Bill,  several  key  components  must  be  in 
place. Firstly, there must be a robust system for collecting and processing tax data accurately 
and efficiently. This system should be integrated with technological tools that can generate 
visual representations of the data in real time. Secondly, a comprehensive public awareness 
campaign  should  be  launched  to  inform  citizens  about  the  availability  of  these  new 
resources and how to access and interpret them. Thirdly, an oversight committee should be 
established to ensure that the data presented is accurate, unbiased, and regularly updated. 
In conclusion, this Bill represents a significant advancement in promoting transparency and 
accountability in the collection and utilization of income tax in India. By providing a visual 
representation of tax data, it aims to make information more accessible and understandable, 
thereby fostering greater trust in the tax system. Furthermore, by educating taxpayers and 
encouraging a more informed and engaged citizenry, the Bill supports the development of 
a more robust, participatory democracy. Ultimately, the successful implementation of this 
Bill has the potential to transform the relationship between the Government and its citizens, 
leading to more effective governance and a stronger, more united nation.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the Central Government to publish visual representation 
of  the  income  tax  collected  in  each  financial  year.  Clause  4  provides  for  the  Central 
Government to publish on the official website of the Income Tax Department of the visual 
representation of income tax collected. Clause 7 provides for the Central Government to 
provide requisite funds for carrying out purposes of this Act. The Bill, therefore, if enacted 
will involve expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated that an annual 
recurring expenditure of about rupees two hundred crore is likely to be involved.

A  non-recurring  expenditure  of  about  rupees  one  hundred  crore  is  also  likely  to  be 

involved.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause 9 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out 
the purposes of the Bill. As the rules will relate to matters of details only the delegation of 
legislative power is of a normal character.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Increasing  exposure  to  variety  of  fast  foods  has  led  to  rise  in  consumption  of  food 
products  which  are  largely  detrimental  to  the  health  of  the  persons.  While  adults  can 
recognise  the  harmful  effects  the  targeted  advertising  of  such  unhealthy  food  products 
towards younger population has led to poor lifestyle standards amongst youth. The need is 
to regulate the sale and advertising of such food products so as to save children from their 
harmful effects.

Childhood  obesity  is  a  major  challenge  in  the  battle  against  rising  rate  of  non-
communicable  diseases  in  India.  While  India  is  already  facing  challenges  in  providing 
affordable  healthcare  access  to  its  citizens,  the  effects  of  poor  lifestyle  habits  among  its 
urban  citizens  adds  further  burden  on  the  country’s  resources.  The  establishment  of 
Nutrition Council under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare with adequate 
representation  of  professionals  will  be  vital  in  regulating  use  of  ingredients  resulting  in 
obesity. A  warning  label  on  food  products  having  more  than  permissible  limit  of  certain 
ingredients would caution the consumers about their ill-effects. 

It is also necessary to place restriction on advertisement of food products which cause 
obesity and sale of such food products near educational institutions.  The Bill, accordingly,  
seeks to amend the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 with a view to reduce consumption 
of unhealthy food products by children.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  constitute  a  Nutrition  Council  to  regulate  the  sale  and 
advertising  of  food  products  which  cause  obesity  amongst  children.  It  also  provides  for 
appointments of experts, officers and employees to the Nutrition Council. The Bill, therefore, 
if enacted, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated 
that a recurring expenditure of about rupees fifty crore per annum would be involved from 
the Consolidated Fund of India.

A  non-recurring  expenditure  of  about  rupees  one  hundred  crore  is  also  likely  to  be 

involved.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

As of now, India did not have an official figure on the number of orphans in this country. 
The latest number is estimated around 20 million, based on a study carried out by the SOS 
Children’s Village Faridabad based NGO by analyzing data from the National Family Health 
Survey-3, in 2011. This vacuum is itself a testament to the treatment orphans face. 

Though orphans have an identity while staying at orphanages, once they turn 18, society 
renders  them  useless.  Without  government  identification,  birth  certificates,  or  residential 
proofs,  it  is  almost  impossible  for  them  to  access  higher  opportunities  for  education  or 
employment. Therefore, it is important for the Government to recognize orphans as socially 
and economically deprived groups and provide them with reservations. Additionally, given 
that  India  has  the  world’s  largest  youth  population  it  is  imperative  that  the  Government, 
through Job reservation, brings orphans one step close towards empowerment and the youth 
of our country towards a brighter future.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  10  of  the  Bill,  inter  alia,  provides  for  formulation  of  welfare  schemes  and 
programmes  for  the  orphans,  rehabilitation  of  orphans  and  developing  and  organizing 
training programmes to advance the competence of the orphans for appointment to services 
and posts. Clause 12 provides for the maintenance of records by the appointing authority.

The Bill, therefore, if enacted, will involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of 
India. However, it is not possible at this stage as to the exact amount which is likely to be 
incurred towards recurring and non-recurring expenditure for the purpose.

7

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause 17 of the Bill empowers the appropriate Government to make rules for carrying 
out the provisions of the Bill. As the matters in respect of which rules may be made under 
the  aforesaid  provisions  are  matters  of  procedure  and  administrative  details  and  it  is  not 
practicable  to  provide  for  them  in  the  Bill  itself.  The  delegation  of  legislative  power  is, 
therefore, of a normal character.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Continuous use of chemical fertilizers leads to soil degradation, reducing its fertility and 
productivity over time. Chemical fertilizers often cause soil acidification, which adversely 
affects the growth of crops. Excessive use of chemical fertilizers leads to water pollution due 
to runoff, contaminating rivers, lakes and groundwater. Nitrogen-based fertilizers contribute 
to the emission of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. 

Over-reliance on chemical fertilizers creates a dependency cycle, requiring increasing 
amounts for the same yield. The cost of chemical fertilizers imposes a financial burden on 
farmers, reducing their profitability. Residues of chemical fertilizers on crops can pose health 
risks to consumers, including various chronic diseases such as cancer, endocrine disruption, 
and developmental disorders. Chemical residues in food can lead to acute poisoning and 
long-term health issues for consumers. The need is to promote organic farming in India as a 
sustainable agricultural practice, reducing the dependency on chemical fertilizers. 

The proposed Bill seeks to address the adverse effects of chemical fertilizers on soil 
health,  environment  and  human  health  and  to  provide  a  framework  for  supporting  and 
encouraging organic farming across the country. 

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for establishment of the National Organic Farming Board 
for carrying out the purpose of the Act. Clause 4 provides for the Central Government to 
formulate schemes to provide financial and technical assistance to farmers adopting organic 
farming  including  subsidies,  financial  assistance  and  training  programs  to  the  farmers 
aimed  at  encouraging  organic  farming  practices.  Clause  5  provides  for  the  appropriate 
Government to establish a certification process for certifying any agricultural produce as 
an organic product to ensure their authenticity and quality under their jurisdiction. Clause 
6  provides  for  the  Central  Government  to  promote  research  and  development  in  organic 
farming through various agricultural research institutions. Clause 8 provides for the Central 
Government to provide adequate funds for carrying out the purpose of the Act. The Bill, 
therefore, if enacted will involve expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund of India. It is 
estimated that a sum of rupees twelve hundred crore would involve as recurring expenditure 
per annum from the Consolidated Fund of India. 

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees fifty crore is also likely to be involved.

the household affixing their photographs for extending the benefit of Employees’ State 
Insurance Scheme as may be prescribed by the State Government.”.

15

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  Mahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee Act,  2005  is  a  social 
security legislation that provides employment for rural  population and ensuring minimum 
number of employment days.

Keeping in view the changing needs of the society, it is essential to amend the law for 
providing more working days, high wages and health amenities to the registered persons 
under  the Act.  The  present  number  of  days  of  employment  wages  are  very  less  and  the 
registered persons are not able to find out their primary needs  depending on the employment 
and salary as per the scheme formulated under the parent Act. The social security welfare 
measures provided to the workers are also less. It is highly necessary to increase the number 
of working days and wages. Moreover, providing health protection to the registered persons 
under Employees’ State Insurance Fund constituted under the Code on Social Security, 2020 
is also inevitable. 

The Bill, therefore, seeks to amend the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment 

Guarantee Act, 2005 with a view to–

(a) increase the maximum number of days of employment to the registered persons 

from hundred days to two hundred days;

(b) increase the wages per day to a minimum of rupees eight hundred; and

(c) extend the benefit of Employees’ State Insurance Fund constituted under the 

Code on Social Security, 2020 to all the registered persons under the Act.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  2  of  the  Bill  provides  for  increasing  the  number  of  days  of  employment  of 
the registered persons from one hundred days to two hundred days under the Act. It also 
provides for ensuring minimum wage of registered persons to rupees eight hundred for each 
day  of  work.  Clause  3  provides  for  extending  the  benefit  of  Employees’  State  Insurance 
Fund constituted under the Code on Social Security, 2020 to all the registered persons under 
the Act. The Bill, therefore, if enacted would involve expenditure from the Consolidated 
Fund of India. It is estimated that a recurring expenditure of about rupees ten lakh crore per 
annum is likely to be involved from the Consolidated Fund of India.

No non-recurring expenditure is likely to be involved.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  vide  proposed  paragraph  37  empowers  the  State  Government  to

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Our country has one of the largest youth population in the world. According to census 
data we have a population of forty-two crores (approx.) in the age group of fifteen to thirty-
five years out which male youth population is 21.76 crores and female youth population is 
20.43 crores (approx). 

The purpose of bringing this Bill is to have a National Youth Commission for the purpose 
of evolving and implementing programmes for educating and empowering the youth. The 
National Youth Commission can work on motto of “Atmavat Manyet Jagat” which means 
“Consider World Like your own self”.

With the vision of inculcation of values of patriotism, nationalism among youth and 
strive for world peace, promotion and protection of physical, moral, spiritual and intellectual 
well-being of the youth as well as developing innovative and scientific attitude among the 
youth with traditional value system, the need for setting of a National Youth Commission 
has been felt for a long time. 

 The aim of the constitution of National Youth Commission is to mobilize and organize 
dynamic youth of nation for resolution of problems of community and to undertake issues 
pertaining  to  their  constructive  development  and  hence  to  utilize  this  power  for  overall 
sustainable development of nation. 

In view of the above, our Nation needs an institutional mechanism with the objectives to 
formulate skilled and flourished youths especially from rural and tribal areas, to devise young 
generation for their perennial and overall development, to mould energetic young human 
resources for sustainable development of the community, to manoeuvre competent youths 
in  policy  making,  involvement  in  different  welfare  activities  of  Government  for  national 
building and also to make available platform on national level as well as globalisation of 
traditional Indian eco friendly skill. 

World’s superpowers are struggling for the young workforce whereas our country is the 
youngest country in the world and in India there is wide human resources which is youth. 
But the fact is these human resources are not utilized in proper way and grievously youth of 
our nation has neutrality about participation in Government initiatives mainly in supporting 
good governance and policy making. Youth are the nation builders and they have capacity 
to transform the face of the nation.

In  order  to  organize  the  youth  in  proper  way  with  achieving  the  both  goals  of  their 
development and nation building, it demands a powerful focused system comprehend all the 
youth development activities under common aegis.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  provides  for  constitution  of  the  National  Youth  Commission. 
Clause 5 provides for appointment of Officers and employees of the Commission. Clause 
6  provides  for  payment  of  salaries,  allowances  and  administrative  expenses  in  respect 
of the National Youth Commission. Clause 12 provides for the payment of grants by the  
Central  Government  to  the  Commission.  The  Bill,  therefore,  if  enacted,  would  involve 
expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated that a recurring expenditure 
of about rupees five crore may be incurred per annum.

A non-recurring annual expenditure of about rupees ten crore is also likely to be incurred.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause  19  of  the  Bill  empowers  the  Central  Government  to  make  rules  for  carrying 
out the purposes of the Bill. As the rules relate to matters of detail only, the delegation of 
legislative power is of a normal character.

Shri P.P. Chaudhary, M.P.

A

BILL

further to amend the Constitution of India.

Be  it  enacted  by  Parliament  in  the  Seventy-fifth  Year  of  the  Republic  of  India  as  

follows:–

1. This Act may be called the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 2024.

Short title.

Amendment 
of the Seventh 
Schedule.

2. In the Seventh Schedule to Constitution,—

(i) in List II–State list, entry 14 shall be omitted; and

2

(ii) in List III–Concurrent List, after entry17B, the following entry shall be inserted, 

namely:—

“17C. Agriculture, including agricultural education and research, protection against 

5

pests and prevention of plant diseases.”.

 
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Agriculture has got pivotal role in Indian economy. Though the share of agriculture in 
the national income is declining, it has a substantial share in Gross Domestic Product of the 
country. Agriculture is the mainstay of livelihood in rural areas. As nearly as 65 per cent. to 
70 per cent. of our total population is engaged in agriculture related activities. Agriculture 
sector can be revitalized by concerted efforts to be made by the State Government as well 
as the Union Government. However, the role of the Union Government is negligible in the 
development of agriculture sector for the reason that agriculture has been listed in the State 
list and is considered as primary responsibility of the State Governments. 

The Bill seeks to amend the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution with a view to transfer 
entry 14 of List II—State List pertaining to ‘Agriculture’, to List III—Concurrent List so 
that the Parliament and Central Government can also play their due role for development of 
agriculture.

Hence this Bill.

A

BILL

to  provide  for  ban  on  entrance  examinations  to  all  professional  courses  in

follows:— 

1. (1) This Act may be called the Ban on Entrance Examination in  Professional Courses 

Act, 2024.

Short title and 
commencement.

  (2)  It  shall  come  into  force  on  such  date,  as  the  Central  Government  may,  by

  2. Notwithstanding anything contained in any order, judgement or direction of any Court 
or any other law for the time being in force or any rule, notification or order issued in this 

behalf, on and from the academic year 2024-25, no entrance examination to the professional

removing the difficulty:

Provided that no such order shall be made after the expiry of the period of two years

(2) Every order made under this section shall, as soon as may be, after it is made, be laid

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

In the recent years, entrance examination are held for admission to various professional 
courses including medical and engineering, etc. Though a student, scores very high marks 
in the 12th examination he shall be given admission only if he scores high percentage in 
the entrance examination. Though the student is intelligent, he will not be able to crack the 
entrance examination as the syllabus is different from what he studied in the school.

Moreover, he has to spend a great amount of money by way of taking admission in 
coaching institutes to pass the entrance examination. But the poor students especially from 
rural areas cannot afford such huge fees in coaching institutes. Therefore, their ambition of 
becoming a doctor or an engineer remains a dream.

There are may instances of students committing suicide due to failure in the entrance 
examination.  Due  to  this  intelligent  students  are  discouraged  to  take  these  examinations. 
Besides  in  the  current  times,  there  has  been  an  alleged  irregularities  in  the  entrance 
examination conducted by Nation Testing Agencies.

To avoid such instances, it is proposed to ban entrance examination to all professional 
courses to facilitate intelligent and poor students to have access to professional courses in 
the country.

Hence this Bill.

2

Establishment of a 
Permanent Bench 
of High Court of 
Kerala at Palakkad.

  2. There shall be established a Permanent Bench of the High Court of  Kerala at Palakkad 
and  such  Judges of  the  High  Court  of Kerala,  being not  less than  five  in  number,  as  the 
Chief Justice of that High Court  may, from time to time nominate, shall sit at Palakkad in 
order to  exercise the jurisdiction and power for the time being vested in that High Court at 
Ernakulam in respect of cases arising in the district of Palakkad and other districts falling 
in the Malabar region of Kerala and such other territories within that State as the President 

5

may by notification specify.   

  
STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The principal seat of the Kerala High Court is at Ernakulam, which is situated at a 
distance  of  nearly  150  kilometres  from  Palakkad  and  more  distance  from  other  districts 
falling in the Malabar region of Kerala to Ernakulam.

Palakkad is the second most industrial district in the State of Kerala, having industrial 
units of both Central and State Governments, apart from private sector units. Palakkad is also 
the divisional headquarter of Southern Railways. In addition to the above, the density of the 
population in the district is also quite high as also in the neighbouring districts. Therefore, 
the  litigations  are  bound  to  be  quite  high  here.  However,  since  the  present  seat  of  the 
High Court of Kerala is far away from here, the litigants are not able to pursue their legal 
cases  as  promptly  as  they  should  be.  Even  if  the  litigants  manage  to  reach  the  present 
High Court at Ernakulam, after sparing their valuable time and money, it is not sure that the 
case will be heard on that day, the case is either postponed for many reasons or the sitting 
is cancelled in the absence of judges, and this way the litigations take years to come to a 
conclusion and this creates a question mark on our judicial system. Moreover, it is the duty 
of a State to make judicial system at the doorstep to provide justice to its citizens and to erase 
the saying that justice delayed is justice denied.

It  will  be,  therefore,  appropriate  if  a  Bench  of  the  High  Court  is  established  at 

Palakkad in the State of Kerala. 

Hence this Bill.

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2024

By

Shri P. P. Chaudhary, M.P.

A

BILL

further to amend the Constitution of India. 

Be  it  enacted  by  Parliament  in  the  Seventy-fifth  Year  of  the  Republic  of  India  as 

follows:— 

1. (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 2024.

Short title and 
commencement.

(2)  It shall come into force on such date, as the Central Government may, by notification 

5

in the official Gazette, appoint. 

2.  In article 58 of the Constitution, in clause (2), for the words ''local or other authority'', 

the words ''local or other authority or institution of self-government'' shall be substituted.

Amendment of 
article 58.

                   
                                                       
          
STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments passed by Parliament in 1992 introduced 
local  self  governance  throughout  the  territory  of  India.  The Acts  came  into  force  as  the 
Constitution  (73rd Amendment) Act,  1992  on April  24,  1993  and  the  Constitution  (74th 
Amendment) Act, 1992 on June 1, 1993.

These amendments added two new parts to the Constitution, namely,—

•  73rd  Amendment  added  Part  IX  titled  “The  Panchayats”  adding  Articles  243  to  

243 (O) dealing  with Panchayats; and 

•  74th Amendment added Part IXA titled “The Municipalities” adding Articles 243(P) 

to 243 (ZG) dealing with Municipality.

Articles 243(G) and 243(W) prescribe the powers, authorities and responsibilities etc. 
of Panchayats and Municipalities respectively. The XI and XII schedule of the Constitution 
define the matters in respect of which schemes for economic development and social justice 
are to be implemented by Panchayats with regards to Article 243(G) and by Municipalities 
with regards to Article 243(W) respectively. The Constitution, hence, deals with Panchayats 
and Municipalities in great detail.

The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments substantially changed the Constitution 
of India and the manner in which representation of the citizens, governance and devolution 
of powers in the nation was to be conducted. 

However,  while  monumental  in  themselves,  the  amendments  failed  to  change  the 

qualifications for the election of the President of the Union of India. 

Article 58(2) states the ineligibility for election as President of India by cause of holding 
an Office of Profit and the above two chapters were introduced without reflecting within the 
article the change in the makeup of the State as undertaken by the institution of the third 
level of governance under Panchayats and Municipalities by these amendments.

The  inclusion  of  Panchayats  and  Municipalities  as  separate  and  distinct  bodies  in 
the Constitution as established by the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments requires 
their inclusion as a disqualification under Office of Profit for the election to the nation’s 
Presidency. This is because the highest holder of office in the nation should not be influenced 
in any manner by any authority in the discharge of his/her duties.

Now  in  view  of  the  above  mentioned  proposed  amendment  the  Panchayats  and 
Municipalities will also be enshrined within the executive offices of the State as offices of 
profit for the Presidency of the nation as distinct bodies rather than their present inclusion 
under ‘any local or other authority’.

Hence  it  has  become  expedient  to  introduce  the  words  ''or  Institution  of  Self  

Government'' within Article 58(2) of the Constitution of India.

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The Waqf Act, 1995, was enacted to provide for the better administration of 
Auqaf and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. However, during 
the  course  of  implementation  of  the Act,  it  is  felt  that  the Act  has  not  proved 
effective in improving the administration of auqaf.  

2. Based on the recommendations of the High-Level Committee under the
chairmanship  of  Justice  (Retired)  Rajinder  Sachar  and  the  Report  of  the  Joint 
Parliamentary  Committee on Waqf  and Central Waqf  Council  and after  having 
detailed consultation with other stakeholders, comprehensive amendments were 
made in the Act in the year 2013. Despite the amendments, it has been observed 
that the Act still requires further improvement to effectively address issues related 
to the powers of the State Waqf Boards, registration and survey of waqf properties, 
removal of encroachments, including the definition of the “waqf” itself.   

3. In view of the above, it has been felt necessary to amend the said Act with
the  aim  to  overcome  the  shortcomings  and  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  the 
administration and management of the waqf properties. Therefore, it is proposed 
to  introduce  in  Parliament  a  Bill  which  seeks  to  address  these  issues 
comprehensively and achieve the intended objectives for effective management, 
empowerment, and development of waqf properties. The Bill, inter alia, provides 
for the followings, namely:— 

(a)

renaming  of  the  Waqf  Act,  1995  as  the  Unified  Waqf

Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act, 1995; 

(b) clearly define “waqf” as waqf by any person practicing Islam for

at least five years and having ownership of such property; 

(c) ensuring that the creation of waqf-alal-aulad does not lead to the

denial of inheritance rights to women; 

(d) omitting the provisions relating to the “waqf by user”;

(e) providing  the  functions  of  the  Survey  Commissioner  to  the
Collector or any other officer not below the rank of Deputy Collector duly 
nominated by the Collector for the survey of waqf properties; 

(f) providing  for  a  broad  based  composition  of  the  Central  Waqf
Council  and  the  State  Waqf  Boards  and  ensuring  the  representation  of 
Muslim women and non-Muslims; 

(g) providing  for  establishment  of  separate  Board  of  Auqaf  for

Boharas and Aghakhanis; 

(h) providing for representation of Shia, Sunni, Bohra, Agakhani and

other backward classes among Muslim communities; 

(i) streamlining the manner of registration of waqfs through a central

portal and database; 

(j) providing  for  a  detailed  procedure  for  mutation  as  per  revenue
laws with due notice to all concerned before recording any property as waqf 
property; 

15 

16 

(k) omitting section 40 relating to the powers of Board to decide if a

property is waqf property; 

(l) decreasing the annual contribution from seven per cent. to five per
cent.  payable  to  the  Board  by  mutawalli  of  every  waqf  having  the  net 
annual income of not less than five thousand rupees; 

(m) providing  for  filing  of  accounts  of  waqf  by  mutawallis  to  the

Board through a central portal for better control over their activities; 

(n) reforming the Tribunal structure with two members and providing
for appeals against the orders of the Tribunal to the High Court within a 
specified period of ninety days; 

(o) omission of section 107 so as to make the Limitation Act, 1963
applicable to any action under the Act; and omission of sections 108 and 
108A relating to special provision as to evacuee waqf properties and Act to 
have overriding effect. 

4. The notes on clauses explain the various provisions of the Bill.

5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

notice of the application to the person administering the waqf property and shall 
hear him if he desires to be heard. 

(8) In the case of auqaf created before the commencement of this Act, every

40  (1)  The  Board  may  itself  collect  information  regarding  any  property 
which  it  has  reason  to  believe  to  be  waqf  property  and  if  any  question  arises

regard to such property and if after such inquiry the Board is satisfied that such 
property is waqt property, call upon the trust or society, as the case may be, either 
to register such property under this Act as waqt property or show cause why such 
property should not be so registered:

under this sub-section shall be given to the authority by whom the trust or society 
had been registered.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The  Boilers  Act,  1923  (the  1923  Act)  was  enacted  with  the  objective  of 
ensuring  uniformity  throughout  India  in  all  technical  aspects  pertaining  to  the 
regulation of boilers. This included standards of construction, maximum pressure 
specifications as well as the registration and periodic inspection of all boilers with 
particular focus on matters concerning the safety of life and property. 

2.  Recently,  the  Government  of  India  has  initiated  a  comprehensive 
examination of pre-Constitutional Acts to assess their relevance and suitability in 
the contemporary context. In this context, the 1923 Act was examined and it has 
been considered necessary to review the provisions of the said Act. As a result, it 
is felt necessary, inter alia, to remove redundant or obsolete provisions; introduce 
certain substantive provisions to enable framing of the rules and regulations that 
were  previously  lacking  and  to  define  certain  terms  and  expressions.  These 
modifications aim to enhance the clarity of the provisions of the Bill.  

3. Therefore, it is considered necessary to repeal the 1923 Act and for that 
purpose  to  introduce  the  Boilers  Bill,  2024  in  Parliament.  The  Bill  seeks  to 
provide  for  the  regulation  of  the  manufacture  and  use  of  boilers,  ensuring  the 
safety of life and property of persons from the danger of explosions of boilers. It 
further  prohibits  the  use  of  unregistered  and  uncertified  boilers,  mandates 
reporting of accidents and promotes uniformity in the registration and inspection 
processes  throughout  the  manufacturing,  erection  and  use  of  the  boilers  in  the 
country. The Bill also proposes independent third-party inspecting authorities for 
inspection and certification purposes.  

4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

clause  32;  (i)  the  manner  of  holding  inquiry  and  imposing  penalty  under               
sub-clause (1) of clause 35; and (j) the form and manner of preferring appeal under 
sub-clause (1) of  clause 36. 

4. The matters in respect of which rules or regulations may be made under 
the aforesaid provisions are matters of procedure and administrative detail and it 
is not practicable to provide for them in the Bill itself. The delegation of legislative 
power is, therefore, of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The Government has received multiple representations from various sources, 
with a request to direct the initiation of the process to identify and determine the 
seats  to  provide  for  reservation  to  the  Scheduled  Tribes  community  in  the 
Legislative Assembly of the State of Goa, as the same is not presently available to 
them.  Since,  the  exercise  of  delimitation  was  initiated  in  the  year  2002,  the 
population of the Schedules Tribes in the State of Goa was recorded at that time in 
the census figures of the year 2001 as only 566, whereas the total population of the 
State of Goa was more than thirteen lakhs, the Scheduled Tribes communities of 
Goa, were not able to avail the benefit of reservations of seats as per the Constitution 
for their communities in the Legislative Assembly. 

2. Subsequently, three new communities, namely, Kunbi, Gawda and Velip 
were  included  in  the  List  of  Scheduled  Tribes  of  the  State  of  Goa  vide  the 
Constitution  (Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  Orders)  Amendment  Act, 
2003  which  increased  the  number  of  Scheduled  Tribes  population  in  the  State 
considerably.  Thus,  a  peculiar  situation  has  arisen  in  the  State,  wherein  the 
population of the Scheduled Tribes in the State vis-à-vis the population of Scheduled 
Castes is considerably higher (as per the Primary Census Abstract, 2011 for the State 
of  Goa, the Total  Population  was  14,58,545;  the population  of  Scheduled Castes 
was 25,449 and the population of Scheduled Tribes was 1,49,275) but no seats are 
reserved for Scheduled Tribes and they are unable to avail the constitutional benefit 
of reservation afforded to them by article 332. 

3. Further, there is no provision in the Representation of the People Act, 1950 
or in the Representation of the People Act, 1951, or in the Delimitation Act, 2002, 
enabling the Election Commission to carry out further delimitation of constituencies 
or to determine constituencies for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes in 
the States/Union territories where the delimitation exercise was carried out by the 
Delimitation Commission constituted under the Delimitation Act, 2002 and in terms 
of the provisions of the Constitution on the basis of 2001 census. 

4. The Delimitation Commission has since ceased to exist after completion of 
its assigned task in the year 2008. Under articles 82 and 170 of the Constitution, 
further delimitation stands frozen until the figures for the first census taken after the 
year  2026  have  been  published.  Therefore,  no  readjustment  of  seats  can  be 
undertaken to provide the reservation of seats for the Scheduled Tribes in the State 
of Goa where the population of the Scheduled Tribes has increased considerably as 
per 2011 census vis-à-vis 2001 census figures.  

5. Therefore, it is imperative to enact a law to provide for enabling provisions 
empowering  the  Election  Commission  of  India  to  make  amendments  in  the 
Delimitation  of  Parliamentary  and  Assembly  Constituencies  Order,  2008  and 
readjust the seats in the Legislative Assembly of the State of Goa for the Scheduled 
Tribes of the State.  

6. In view of the above, it has been decided to introduce in Parliament a Bill 
for enabling reservation of seats in accordance with article 332 of the Constitution 
for  effective  democratic  participation  of  members  of  Scheduled  Tribes  and  to 
provide for  the readjustment  of  seats in  the Legislative Assembly of  the State of 
Goa,  in  so  far  as  such  readjustment  is  necessitated  by  inclusion  of  certain 
communities in the list of the Scheduled Tribes in the State of Goa and for matters 
connected therewith or incidental thereto. 

7. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

The Bill, if enacted, does not involve any expenditure either recurring or 

non-recurring from and out of the consolidated fund of India.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Sub-clause  (1)  of  clause  4  of  the  Bill  confers  powers  upon  the  Election 
Commission  to  make  necessary  amendments  it  in  the  Delimitation  Order  having 
regard to the relevant provisions of the Constitution, the Delimitation Act and the 
provisions of this Bill. 

2.  Sub-clause  (1)  of  clause  7  of  the  Bill  confers  powers  upon  the  Election 
Commission to make, by notification, correction of printing mistake or any error in 
the Delimitation Order and also to make necessary amendments therein, pursuant to 
any change in boundaries and name of any district or territorial division. 

3.  Sub-clause  (1)  of  clause  8  of  the  Bill  confers  powers  upon  the  Central 
Government to issue orders to remove any difficulty which may arise to give effect 
to the provisions of the proposed enactment within a period of two years. 

4. The notification issued by the Election Commission shall be laid, as soon 
as,  it  is  issued,  before  each  House  of  Parliament  and  before  the  Legislative 
Assembly of the State. The order made by the Central Government shall be laid, as 
soon as, it is issued, before each House of Parliament. 

5. The matters in respect of which the notification may be issued or the order 
may be made are matters of procedure and administrative detail. The delegation of 
legislative power is, therefore, of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

Originally,  oilfields,  mines  and  minerals  were  comprehensively  regulated 
together through the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948. 
Subsequently,  in  1957,  the  Mines  and  Minerals  (Development  and  Regulation)    
Act, 1957 was enacted for the development and regulation of mines and minerals 
under the control of the Union. The original Act of 1948 was also renamed as the 
Oilfields  (Regulation  and  Development)  Act,  1948  (the  said  Act)  and  made 
applicable to mineral oils only.  

2. The  said Act, which  provides  for  a very  different  global  energy  context,
requires to be amended to meet the needs and aspirations of the country for energy 
access,  energy  security  and  energy  affordability.  Further,  there  is  an  urgent  and 
pressing  need  to  increase  domestic  production  of  oil  and  gas  to  meet  the  rising 
demand for energy and reduce import dependence of the country. In order to unlock 
valuable mineral oil resources, it is necessary to attract investment in the sector to 
infuse necessary capital and technology for expediting petroleum operations in the 
country by creating an investor friendly environment that promotes ease of doing 
business,  prospects  for  exploration,  development  and  production  of  all  types  of 
hydrocarbons, ensures stability, promotes adequate opportunities for risk mitigation, 
addresses  energy  transition  issues  including  next-generation  cleaner  fuels  and 
provides  for  a  robust  enforcement  mechanism  for  ensuring  compliance  of  the 
provisions of the said Act.  

3. Therefore, it is felt necessary to amend the said Act and for that purpose to
introduce  the  Oilfields  (Regulation  and  Development)  Amendment  Bill,  2024  in 
Parliament.  The  salient  features  of  the  amendments  proposed  in  the  said  Bill,      
inter alia, are— 

(a) delinking of petroleum operations from mining operations;

(b) broadening the scope of the expression “mineral oils”;

(c) Introducing the concept of “petroleum lease”;

(d) granting lease on stable terms;

(e) strengthening  petroleum  operations  through  rules  framed  for
governing various functional aspects, such as, grants of leases or licences, their 
extension or renewal, sharing of production and processing facilities including 
infrastructure and safety at oilfields; 

(f) providing for efficacious dispute resolution;

(g) decriminalising  the  provisions  of  the  said  Act  by  introducing
penalties, adjudication by an adjudicating authority and appeal as against the 
order of adjudicating authority; 

(h) creating an environment for facilitating energy transition by enabling
development of comprehensive energy projects for harnessing wind and solar 
energy along with mineral oils at oilfields. 

4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to empower the Central Government to make rules 
for the purposes of regulating various aspects of petroleum leases such as the grant, 
extension and renewal thereof, including the terms subject to which they may be 
merged or combined. The clause also provides for residuary powers to frame rules 
relating to matters connected therewith. 

2. Clause  6  of  the Bill  seeks  to  empower  the  Central  Government  to  make
rules regarding matters connected with mineral oil development including safety, 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and facilitating development of comprehensive 
energy projects at oilfields. The clause also provides for residuary powers to frame 
rules relating to matters connected therewith. 

3. Clause 8 of the Bill provides for insertion of new sections 9A and 9B so as
to  empower  the  Central  Government  to  make  rules  for  providing  the  eligibility 
criteria for designation of an adjudicating authority and for providing the manner in 
which the adjudicating authority shall conduct inquiry and impose the penalties. 

4. The matters in respect of which rules may be made are matters of procedure

or detail. The delegation of legislative power is, thus, of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The Disaster Management Act, 2005 (the Act) was enacted to provide for the 
effective  management  of  disasters  and  for  matters  connected  therewith  or 
incidental thereto. 

2.  The  main  purpose  of  the  Act  was  to  put  in  place  necessary  institutional 
mechanisms  for  drawing  up  and  monitoring  the  implementation  of  disaster 
management  plans,  ensuring  measures  by  various  wings  of  Government  for 
prevention of and mitigating the effects of disasters and for undertaking a holistic, 
coordinated and prompt response to any disaster or threatening disaster situation.  

3. For achieving the said purpose, certain Authorities and Committees were 
established at the national level, state level and District level.  In addition, the Act 
enumerated the measures to be taken up by the Ministries and Departments of the 
Government of India and mandated that every Ministry or Department would carry 
out the nodal responsibilities in respect of disaster management. 

4.  Due  to  the  constant  endeavour  of  the  Central  Government  for 
mainstreaming the Disaster Management in the development plans, aligning with 
the  recommendations  of  the  Fifteenth  Finance  Commission,  learnings  from  past 
disasters, and experience gained during the implementation of the Act, the Disaster 
Management  Act,  2005  has  been  reviewed  in  consultation  with  all  stakeholders 
including State Governments.  

5. In view of above, it has become necessary to amend certain provisions of 
the Act in the form of a Bill, namely, the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill, 
2024 which, inter alia, provides for the following, namely:— 

(i) to bring more clarity and convergence in the roles of Authorities and 

Committees working in the field of disaster management; 

(ii) to provide statutory status to certain pre-Act organisations like the 

National Crisis Management Committee and the High Level Committee; 

(iii)  to  strengthen  the  efficient  working  of  the  National  Disaster 

Management Authority and the State Disaster Management Authorities; 

(iv) to empower the National Disaster Management Authority and the 
State  Disaster  Management  Authorities  to  prepare  the  disaster  plan  at 
national  level  and  state  level  instead  of  the  National  Executive  Committee 
and the State Executive Committee; 

(v)  to  provide  for  creation  of  disaster  database  at  national  and  state 

level; 

(vi) to make provision for constitution of “Urban Disaster Management 
Authority” for State Capital and large cities having Municipal Corporation; 
and 

(vii)  to  make  provision  for  constitution  of  “State  Disaster  Response 

Force” by the State Government.   

6. The Notes on Clauses explain in detail the various provisions contained in 

the Bill. 

7.  The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

regulations, bilateral and multilateral agreements and arrangements to which India 
is a contracting party or which has been acceded to or ratified by India. 

3. The Aircraft Act, 1934 has been amended several times to enhance safety,
oversight and to meet requirements for sustainable growth of aviation sector and 
to  give  effect  to  the  provisions  of  international  conventions.  As  a  result  of 
numerous amendments over a period of ninety years, a need is felt to address the 
ambiguities  and  confusion  experienced  by 
to  remove 
redundancies, to enable ease of doing business and to provide for manufacture and 
maintenance in the aviation sector and to re-enact the aforesaid Act in the form of 
a Bill, namely, the Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak, 2024.

standards and recommended practices) as amended from time to time. Sub-clause 
(2) of  the  said  clause  empowers  the  Central  Government  to  make  rules  as  may
appear  to  it  to  be  necessary  or  expedient  for  the  issuance  of  Radio  Telephone

International Telecommunication Convention as amended from time to time.

means of any aircraft leaving an aerodrome; and to make, with respect to aircraft 
and aerodromes or any specified aerodrome, rules providing for any of the matters 
for which rules under sub-clauses (i) to (viii) of clause (p) of sub-section (1) of 
section 6 of the Indian Ports Act, 1908, may be made with respect to vessels and 
ports. 

Sub-clause (2) of clause 14 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to 
make  temporary  rules  with  respect  to  aircraft  and  persons  travelling  or  things 
carried therein and aerodromes as it deems necessary in the circumstances. 

Clause 16 of the Bill inter alia empowers the Central Government to make 
rules  which  may  provide  for  securing  the  safe  custody  and  redelivery  of  any 
property which, while not in proper custody, is found on any aerodrome or in any 
aircraft on any aerodrome. 

Sub-clause (2) of clause 17 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to 
make  rules  regulating  all  matters  incidental  or  subsidiary  to  the  exercise  of  the 
power to detain the aircraft.  

Clause 19  of  the Bill  empowers  the  Central  Government  to  make  rules  to

make rules to provide for the form and manner in which an appeal may be filed 
and the documents and fee it may accompany. 

2. The matters in respect of which rules may be made are matters of procedure 
and administrative detail and it is not practicable to provide for them in the Bill 
itself. The delegation of Legislative power is, therefore, of a normal character.

be of no effect, as the case may be; so, however, that any such modification or annulment 
shall be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under that rule.

  
  
  
  
  
  
 
STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Certain areas of our country have large population of the Scheduled Castes and the 
Scheduled Tribes.  But there are not enough educational facilities in those areas.  The children 
belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, being generally poor, cannot 
afford good education in private schools and the number of good Government schools are 
limited in number.

Therefore,  it is  proposed  that free  residential schools should  be  set  up exclusively 
for children belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes with all facilities in those 
areas where the population the Scheduled  Castes or  the Scheduled Tribes  is significantly 
high.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to set up residential schools exclusively for children belonging 
to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in areas where their concentration is high. 
The Bill, therefore, if enacted, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of 
India. It is likely to involve an annual recurring expenditure of about rupees three hundred 
crore. 

A  non-recurring  expenditure  of  about  rupees  five  hundred  crore  would  also  be 

involved.

 
 
 
MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 7 of the Bill seeks to empower the Central Government to make rules for 
carrying out the purposes of the Bill.  As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, the 
delegation of legislative power is of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The Government implements several Central Sector Schemes and Centrally Sponsored 
Schemes  to  supplement  the  efforts  of  the  State  Government  financially.  These  are  also 
implemented to align the objectives of the National Development Agenda with that of the 
State’s as well as to ensure inclusive development of all States by targeting key structural 
objectives like poverty elimination, social inclusion and livelihood guarantee. 

However,  it  has  been  witnessed  that  the  systems  of  compliance  and  accountability 
for  efficient  and  time  bound  implementation  of  these  schemes  have  been  lacking.  Many 
problems  like  appropriate  dispensation  of  funds  or  governance  problems  with  respect  to 
availability of land, impede the potential progress of these schemes. 

Therefore, to strengthen these mechanisms and for the effective dispensation of public 
goods,  the  District  Development  and  Monitoring  Committees  are  being  instituted. These 
committees comprise the Members of Parliament who would monitor the progress of the 
Central  Sector  and  Centrally  Sponsored  Schemes  in  the  districts  of  their  constituencies. 
The  Committees  include  representations  from  the  District  Collectors,  Members  of  State 
Legislative Assemblies, State Governments, Municipalities and Gram Panchayats, hence, 
covering all wings of the Government to ensure coordination and alignment of objectives. 

The  functions  of  these  Committees  include  coordination  between  all  wings  of  the 
Government  to  solve  problems  of  governance,  resolving  matters  of  land  and  space, 
recommending  improvements  in  system  design  of  the  schemes,  looking  into  appropriate 
dispensation  of  funds  and  following  up  with  the  Parliament,  State Assembly  and  Local 
Government. 

The  present  Bill  institutes  mechanisms  to  ensure  accountability  of  the  Committees 
themselves. The  minutes  of  the  meeting  are  required  to  be  recorded  and  uploaded  on  an 
MIS portal by the Central Government as well as information distributed to all the relevant 
stakeholders. Additionally,  a  randomized  audit  is  also  required  to  be  conducted  of  a  few 
districts each year to oversee whether the meetings are being conducted as per the prescribed 
mandate. 

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  present  Bill  respects  and  keeps  intact  the  division  of 
power under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India by having an advisory nature 
and a monitoring role of schemes with the Central Government’s involvement. 

The Bill, therefore, seeks to provide for a smooth flowing system of accountability to 
effectively achieve universal coverage of all development schemes that have the involvement 
of the Central Government. 

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  constitution  of  the  District  Development  and 
Monitoring Committees at the district level by the Central Government.  Clause 4 provide for 
the meetings of the Committees. The Bill, therefore, if enacted would involve expenditure 
from  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  India.  It  is  estimated  that  about  rupees  four  crores  and  
eight lakh per annum would involve from the Consolidated Fund of India. Clause 7 provides 
for deputing five officers from the Central Government to oversee the timely conduct of 
meetings of the Committee. In respect of this clause, an indicative recurring expenditure of 
about rupees eight lakh per annum is estimated.

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees sixty lakh is also likely to be involved.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause 9 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out 
the purposes of the Bill. As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, the delegation of 
legislative power is of a normal character.

Act, 2024.

Short title and

Insertion of new 
section 8A.

Reservation in

Insertion of new 
section 13A.

Reservation

universities (including a technical, trade, or vocational school) shall reserve at least of 
one per cent. of the total seats in each class or course for the transgender persons in such 
manner as may be prescribed.”.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

For centuries, the transgender community has been ostracized across the world leading 
to  denial  of  basic  human  rights  that  cisgender  individuals  enjoy.  This  extreme  social 
exclusion has translated to increased marginalisation and limited access to opportunities. 

Offering a glimmer of hope, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India passed a landmark 
judgement on the April 15, 2014 which acknowledged the rampant discrimination faced by 
the transgender community and recognised their constitutional rights to equality, liberty and 
dignity. As a means to uplift the trans people, the Court further directed the Central and State 
Governments  to  take  proactive  steps  towards  the  advancement  of  their  community.  This 
included extending “all kinds of reservation in cases of admission in educational institution 
and for public appointments” as the community is “entitled to reservation in the matter of 
appointment, as envisaged under Article 16(4) of the Constitution”. 

In 2021, the Central Government had moved a Cabinet note proposing to add transgender 
persons  to  the  list  of  Other  Backward  Classes  (OBCs). Although  created  with  the  right 
intentions of addressing the plight of the transgender community, the proposed legislation 
amounts to vertical reservation for the community which fails to account for the intersection 
between caste identities and the diverse notion of gender.

Such an arrangement results in certain caste groups left with entrenched discrimination 
and stigma on both these accounts. According to a study conducted by the Centre for Law 
and Policy Research on the experience of intersectionality, Dalit transgender persons faced 
the most violence in school and were especially vulnerable to sexual violence at work with 
33 per cent. reporting sexual assault and harassment at work. They also faced harassment 
in  their  interactions  with  police  officials:  23  per  cent.  of  Dalit  transgender  persons  were 
forcibly denuded or stripped by the police and 19 per cent. were sexually assaulted when 
they approached the police seeking assistance. It extended to matters pertaining to accessing 
public  transport  and  public  spaces  as  well  such  as  parks  (50  per  cent.),  police  stations  
(46 per cent.) and Government hospitals (43 per cent.). Furthermore, 56 per cent. of Dalit 
transgender respondents were forced to engage in sexual activity to access shelter, food or 
gain employment. 

In the state of Karnataka, horizontal reservation has been implemented for transgender 
persons in the state civil services across all caste categories by providing 1 per cent. separate 
reservation  for  transgender  persons  within  each  ‘vertical’  SC/ST/OBC/General  category. 
This adequately tries to redress the discrimination received by the community of complex 
social and economic dimensions. 

A policy of horizontal reservation recognises the intersectionality of caste, class and 
gender  and  the  nuances  of  discrimination,  creating  an  environment  that  is  inclusive  and 
allows every individual of the transgender community to thrive in every space of society

Hence this Bill.

BILL

 to provide for the establishment of a Permanent Bench of the High Court of Kerala at 
Thiruvananthapuram.

B(cid:3454)  it  enacted  by  Parliament  in  the  Seventy-fifth  Year  of  the  Republic  of  India  as 

follows:— 

1. (1) This Act may be called the High Court of Kerala (Establishment of a Permanent 

Bench at Thiruvananthapuram) Act, 2024.

Short title and 
commencement.

in the Official Gazette, appoint.

Permanent Bench 
of High Court of
Kerala at 
Thiruvananthapuram.

  2.  There  shall  be  established  a  permanent  Bench  of  the  High  Court  of  Kerala  at 
Thiruvananthapuram and such Judges of the High Court of Kerala, being not less than five 
in number, as the Chief Justice of that High Court may, from time to time nominate, shall 
sit at Thiruvananthapuram in order to exercise the jurisdiction and power for the time being 
vested in that High Court in respect of cases arising in the district of Thiruvananthapuram 
and such other territories within that State as the President may by notification specify.

  
STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  principal  seat  of  the  Kerala  High  Court  is  at  Ernakulam,  which  is  situated  at 
a distance of 200 kilometers from the  State Capital, Thiruvananthapuram. Ever since the 
formation of the State of Kerala in 1956, there has been a demand for the establishment of a 
permanent Bench at the State Capital.

It has been observed that the State is a principal litigant in a majority of cases pending 
in  the  High  Court  of  Kerala.  This  leads  to  the  State  Government  incurring  considerable 
expenditure on account of travelling allowance and leave allowance given to the Government 
employees  for  travelling  from  Thiruvananthapuram,  the  state  capital  to  Ernakulam  for 
depositions.

Moreover, it has been the policy of the successive Governments that justice should 
be taken to the doors of the litigants and therefore the litigants should not be compelled to 
go long distance to the Court. In the interest of administration of justice, the court must be 
easily accessible to the litigants and witnesses.

It  will  be,  therefore,  appropriate  if  a  Bench  of  High  Court  is  established  at    

Thiruvananthapuram.

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

There are millions of traditional fishermen spread across various parts of our country.  
In the State of Uttar Pradesh the traditional fishermen are termed as ‘nishad’ or ‘mallah’. 
Their main occupation and means of livelihood is catching fish and selling it in the market 
and they are doing this for generations. However, the fishermen and their families live in 
abject poverty nearly hand to mouth. There are many problems experienced by traditional 
fishermen, including a lack of skills, limited facilities, and extreme competition.

For most of the traditional fishermen, it is their family profession which passes on from 
one generation to other and their entire families are involved in this profession. For them, 
fishing is the only source of their livelihood and prosperity. 

Since these poor fishermen are part and parcel of our society and ours being a welfare 
State,  it  is  necessary  that  the  fisherman  too  are  provided  with  adequate  insurance  cover 
against accidents, healthcare, financial assistance in case of need, educational, vocational 
facilities for their children, etc.

Urgent remedial measures have to be taken for the welfare and protection of traditional 
fishermen. It has, therefore, been proposed to establish the National Traditional Fishermen 
Authority and also the Traditional Fishermen Welfare Fund to improve the lot of traditional 
fishermen and save them from starvation in various parts of our nation.

 Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  4  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  constitute  the  National  Traditional  Fishermen  Welfare 
Authority. Clause 5 provides for certain steps to be taken by the Authority for welfare of 
traditional fishermen. Clause 6 provides for the constitution of the Traditional Fishermen 
Welfare  Fund.  Clause  7  provides  for  the  appropriate  Government  to  establish  adequate 
number of schools and vocational training institutes and healthcare centres in and around 
the  areas  inhabitated  by  traditional  fishermen  for  their  benefit  including  their  families. 
Clause 8 provides that the Central Government shall provide Funds to the Authority. The 
Bill, therefore, if enacted, will involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It 
is estimated that a sum of rupees five hundred crore may involve as recurring expenditure 
per annum.

A non-recurring expenditure of rupees two hundred crore is also likely to be incurred.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause 12 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out

STATEMENT  OF  OBJECTS  AND  REASONS

In several parts of our vast nation floods are a regular phenomenon caused by mother 
nature fury every year. Even this year floods have  wreaked  havoc  in various States  such 
as  Bihar,  Uttar  Pradesh,  Punjab,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Uttarakhand,  Madhya  Pradesh, 
Chhattisgarh,  Maharashtra, Assam  and  Odisha.  It  has  not  spared  even  desert  States  such 
as Gujarat and Rajasthan. Bihar, Assam and eastern Uttar Pradesh which face the fury of 
floods every year caused by rivers emanating from Nepal and China. Apart from the fury of 
mother nature humans too have contributed immensely in the matter. Polluted environment, 
unplanned and uncontrolled development in the cities particularly those which are near the 
rivers and sea, ruthless destruction of jungles, rampant use of plastic, toxic gases, chemicals, 
etc.  lead  to  disruption  in  the  weather  cycle  in  the  country  frequently  culminating  in  the 
fury  of  floods.  The  floods  devastate  quite  a  large  number  of  villages,  cities  and  damage 
properties,  crops,  roads  and  kill  human  being  and  livestock.  The  agricultural  land  also 
undergoes severe soil erosion. Due to these floods country suffers huge losses in terms of 
human lives, livestock, properties, crops, etc. thereby increasing the financial burden of the 
Governments of the day. At the same time persons become homeless and get displaced and 
face innumerable problems including safety of their lives. 

Though  the  Central  Government  and  State  Governments  and  their  agencies  do  their 
level  best  to  provide  relief  to  the  victims  of  floods  and  their  kins  by  making  temporary 
arrangements of shelter, food etc. for them, it is felt that there still is need to have a permanent 
statutory body to suggest measures to control floods. As such a National Board needs to be 
established to exclusively deal with natural calamity of floods in the country.  

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the establishment of a National Board for Rehabilitation 
and  Welfare  of  Flood  Victims.  Clause  8  seeks  to  provide  requisite  funds  by  the  Central 
Government for effective implementation of the provisions of the Bill. The Bill, if enacted, 
will involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India.  However, at this stage, it is 
not possible to quantify the amount but it is estimated that an amount of one thousand crore 
rupees may involve as recurring expenditure per annum. 

A non-recurring expenditure to the tune of five hundred crore rupees may also involve 

for creating assets.

 further to amend the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950.  

Be  it  enacted  by  Parliament  in  the  Seventy-fifth  Year  of  the  Republic  of  India  as 

follows:—    

1. This Act may be called the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Act,

2.  In  the  Schedule  to  the  Constitution  (Scheduled Tribes)  Order,  1950,  in  Part  XIV, 

Tamil Nadu, for entry 18, the following entry shall be substituted, namely:— 

Amendment of 
the Schedule.

"18.  Kuruma,  Kuruman,  Kurumba,  Kurmbagounder,  Kurumban  and 
Kurumbar.”. 

                   
                                                       
          
 
 
 
STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The Kurumans is aboriginal tribe of Tamil Nadu and are dwelling throughout the State 
of Tamil Nadu with their tradition, culture, custom, traits, etc. but still being denied the ST 
categorisation and other affirmative actions in the better interest of the tribe community. 

As per the article 366(25) of the Constitution of India, Scheduled Tribe means such tribe 
or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribe for the purpose of Constitution 
of  article  342(2)  to  specify  the  Tribe.  Kurumans  synonyms  are  presently  deprived  and 
denied their constitutional rights being extended to tribes. The said community is tribal by 
birth, culture, customs, traits, as concluded, under an ethnographic detailed study by the 
Tribal Research Centre, Ooty, Tamil Nadu. Moreover, as early as Meckenzie Manuscript's 
1816, First India Surveyor General of India and other Tribal Literature viz. Madras General 
of  Literature  and  Science  support  the  Kurumans  Tribes  synonyms  with  common  and 
generic name & culture, customs, history and origination, therefore, to be identified under 
ST Categorisation. 

In order to render the social justice and affirmative actions without further loss of time, 
this bill seeks to amend 'The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950' for inclusion 
of Kurumans synonyms names such as “Kuruma, Kuruman, Kurumba, Kurmbagounder, 
Kurumban, Kurumbar tribes” in the ST List in order to render social justice to oppressed 
and suppressed Kurumans & its synonyms names. That will ensure constitutional protection 
to the adivasi's Kurumans tribal synonyms against all sorts of socio-economic exploitation. 
Moreover it will confer all Constitutional and Legal Rights to Kuruman generic tribes as 
guaranteed under article 46 of the Constitution. 

Hence this Bill.

 FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

The Bill seeks to include Kuruma, Kuruman, Kurumba, Kurmbagounder, Kurumban 
and  Kurumbar  as  the  synonym  name  of  Kurumans  to  the  list  of  Scheduled  Tribes  with 
respect to the State of Tamil Nadu by way of amending the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) 
Order, 1950. The Bill, if enacted, would involve recurring and non-recurring expenditure on 
account of the benefits to be given under the schemes and programmes of the Government 
meant for social, educational and economic development of the Scheduled Tribes. At this 
stage, it is not possible to mention the exact amount which may be incurred on this account. 
However, it is estimated that a sum of approximately rupees thirty-five crore is likely to be 
involved as a recurring expenditure per annum. 

A  non-recurring  expenditure  of  about  rupees  seventy  crore  is  also  likely  to  be 

involved.

As introduced in Lok Sabha

THE RAILWAYS (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2024

Bill No. 31 of 2024

By

Dr. Alok Kumar Suman, M.P.

a

BILL

further to amend the Railways Act, 1989.

Be  it  enacted  by  Parliament  in  the  Seventy-fifth  Year  of  the  Republic  of  India  as 

follows:—  

1. (1) This Act may be called the Railways (Amendment) Act, 2024.

(2) It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification 

5

in the Official Gazette, appoint. 

24 of 1989.

2. After section 24 of the Railways Act, 1989, the following section shall be  inserted, 

namely:—

10

“24A. Notwithstanding anything contained in section 22, 23 and 24 of the Act, 
the Central Government may, by notification, sanction the running or extension or 
diversion of super fast trains via Thawe junction in the State of Bihar by approving 
the proposal received from the Railway Division of the North-Eastern Region and 
extension of train no. 22411/22412 (Arunachal Express) via route Siwan-Thawe-
Kaptanganj-Gorakhpur.”.

Short title and 
commencement.

Insertion of new 
section 24A.

Special 
Provisions 
of railway at 
Thawe junction 
in the State of 
Bihar.

 
 
 
 
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The section of Varanasi division of North-Eastern Railway which comprises Thawe-
Gopalganj junction is facing number of challenges and disadvantage due to non-availability 
of superfast trains for various metropolitan cities of the country. To overcome such difficulties 
and to make railway connectivity from this neglected section by providing the train facilities 
would certainly provide ample revenue to railways. 

At Thawe junction in the Thawe-Gopalganj section, there is one of the most important 
and  reverable  religious  peeth.    Seeing  the  rush  of  pilgrims  during  normal  days  and  huge 
rush during auspicious days, and considering the fact that this area is the native to  lakhs 
of migrant labours who are working in different parts of country, especially, NCR and the 
States of Haryana, Punjab, J&K, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, 
Kerala, West-Bengal, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh etc., the train facilities to this junction is 
must. Apart from the above, people of this area depends on bigger cities of country for any 
specialized medical facilities and education too.  This section/area does not have any direct 
train for Delhi or any other metropolitan cities. 

The Bill, therefore, seeks to amend the Railways Act, 1989 with a view to implement 
the proposal of North-Eastern Railway once received for approval without any further delay 
to augment the train services to cater the need of the neglected Thawe Junction which is a 
long awaited demand of lakhs of people of the various districts of the State of Uttar Pradesh 
and Bihar. 

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 2 of the Bill vide proposed section 24A seeks to provide diversion or extension 
of the superfast trains via Thawe junction by giving the approval of the proposal received 
from the railway division of the North-Eastern Region. The Bill, therefore, if enacted, will 
involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is likely to involve an annual 
recurring expenditure of about rupees two hundred and fifty crore from  the Consolidated 
Fund of India.

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees three hundred crore is also likely to be 

involved.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Usually, when we talk of an orphan, we mean a child who has been either abandoned 
deliberately by their parents or a child who has lost his/her parents in an accident or mishap. 
As per the United Nations Conventions on Rights of the Child (UNCRC), a child is anyone 
who  is  below  the  age  of  18  years  or  unless  under  the  law  applicable  to  the  child,  the 
majority is attained earlier. Every child has the right to family care. This provision is found 
in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, the UN Guidelines for Alternative Care 
2009, the Indian Constitution and the jurisprudence of the Indian Supreme Court on child 
rights.

India is home to approximately 29.6 million orphan children, which amounts to nearly 
four  percent  of  the  youth  population.  This  alarming  figure  underscores  the  urgent  need 
for  comprehensive  and  effective  legislation  to  safeguard  the  rights  and  welfare  of  these 
vulnerable children.

The Bill seeks to provide social security and welfare measures to orphan children and 
to address the needs of special needs children who are orphans, who are among the most 
vulnerable  sections  of  our  society.  Moreover,  the  existing  provisions  do  not  adequately 
address the issue of overcrowding in orphan care homes or orphanages. Overcrowding can 
lead to inadequate care and attention for each child, compromising their development and 
well-being. The proposed amendments also include the establishment of a Central Registry 
of all orphan children by the Central Government to streamline the adoption process and 
ensure  transparency.  This  will  help  in  the  efficient  tracking  and  placement  of  orphan 
children in suitable homes.

In India, there is no separate legislation dealing with Orphans. Orphans and vulnerable 
groups  are  included  under  the  Juvenile  Justice Act. According  to  the  concept  of  Parens 
Patriae,  the  State  is  your  parent  if  you  have  none.  This  statement  is  truer  for  no  other 
category of citizens but orphans. Therefore, the bill has been brought exclusively for the 
Orphans to ensure that they are provided with their fundamental right to life, as guaranteed 
under our Constitution.

Hence this Bill.

 FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for survey of orphan children. Clause 4 of the Bill provides 
for social security to orphan child, monthly bank savings for child welfare in future, free 
education, food, clothing and lodging, medical and other healthcare facilities, free travel and 
free legal assistance may be provided to orphan child. Clause 5 provides for constitution of 
an Orphan Children Welfare Fund. Clause 6 provides for establishment of foster care homes 
to provide free food, lodging and other requisite amenities to orphans. The Bill, therefore, if 
enacted, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated that 
a sum of rupees two thousand crore would be involved as recurring expenditure per annum. 

A  non-recurring  expenditure  of  about  rupees  ten  thousand  crore  is  also  likely  to  be 

involved.

5

 
 
 
 MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 8 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out 
the provisions of the Bill. As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, therefore, the 
delegation of legislative power is of a normal character.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Information technology industry is one of the fastest growing industries of the country. 
There is tremendous potential for further growth  of this industry. What is  needed  is  the 
formulation  of  a  proper  policy  and  assistance  from  the  Government.  If  these  are  put  in 
place, there is no doubt that our country will rank number one in terms of export of software 
and hardware. 

At present, there is no clear policy for the development of information technology in 
the country. The Government does not give any assistance to the companies working in this 
field. Several foreign companies are willing to set up their offices in our country but due to 
lack of required infrastructure they prefer to stay away. As a result these companies go to 
other countries who offer better infrastructure. This industry can prove to be a major source 
of revenue for the Government and also provide immense employment opportunities to our 
people but so far the Government has not done much to tap the huge growth potential of 
Information Technology industry. 

Therefore, it is proposed that a National Commission on Information Technology be 
set up to regulate and promote the development of information technology industry in the 
country. It is also proposed that a national policy on information technology be formulated. 

Hence this Bill.

 FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  establishment  of  a  Information  Technology 
Commission  for  Regulation  and  Development  of  Information  Technology  Industry.  It 
also provides for the composition of the Commission  and  salaries and allowances of  the 
Chairperson  and  members  of  the  Commission.  Clause  4  provides  that  the  Commission 
shall  set  up  information  technology  parks  in  cities  with  population  of  one  million  or 
more.  Clause  5  provides  that  the  appropriate  Government  shall  provide  all  assistance  to 
the Commission in setting up of information technology parks. Clause 7 provides for the 
Central Government to provide adequate funds. The expenditure relating to States shall be 
borne out of the Consolidated Funds of the respective States. However, the expenditure in 
respect of Union territories shall be borne out of the Consolidated Fund of India. The Bill, 
therefore, if enacted, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is 
estimated that an annual recurring expenditure of about rupees ten thousand crore will be 
involved.

A non-recurring expenditure  of  about  rupees five  thousand  crore  is also  likely  to  be 

involved.

 
 
 
 
 MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 10 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out 
the purposes of the Bill. As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, the delegation of 
legislative power is of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Dogs  have  been  the  companions  of  humans  for  a  long  time.  They  deserve  just  and 

humane treatment. At the same time, they also deserve to be cared for at a place under good 

human supervision. If such a supervision is not available, they could turn into a menace. 

While  individual  dogs  actually  help  humans  and  live  in  a  symbiotic  relationship, 

uncontrolled  expansion  of  canine  population  could  lead  to  their  packs  turning  into  more 

and more territorial and aggressive behaviour. There has been many documented cases in 

which dogs from such packs attacking humans without any provocation. In many States like 

Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir, stray dog menace has reached epic proportions. There are 

legislations  on  force  in  States  like  Sikkim  where  there  are  measures  available  to  control 

the  stray  dog  menace.  Such  a  legislation  also  helps  to  control  the  population  and  ensure 

quality care to existing dog population. Instituting a mechanism to ensure control of canine 

population and also control spread of rabies is in the best interest of people and dogs living 

with them.

The  Bill,  therefore,  seeks  to  regulate  the  destruction  of  rabid  animals  and  for  the 

prevention and control of the disease in the interest of the public health.

Hence this Bill.

Clause  7  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  constitution  of  the  Licensing  and  Registering 

Authority  for  the  purpose  of  registration  of  dogs  over  the  age  of  three  months  and 

thereafter  annually.  The  Bill,  therefore  if  enacted,  would  involve  expenditure  from  the

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The State of Bihar is socially and economically backward. The low pace of development in 
the State has resulted in the impoverishment of the State and its people. The development of Bihar 
is the need not only of that State but of the entire country as a whole.  

The development of the State can be ensured only with the active involvement of the Central 
Government.  For  this,  it  is  necessary  that  the  Central  Government  provides  special  economic 
assistance to the State for its all round development including the welfare of weaker sections and 
for  the  development  and  exploitation  of  its  vast  resources.  Such  a  step  would  go  a  long  way  in 
building our nation more and more strong.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Education  is  a  fundamental  right  of  every  child,  which  is  essential  for  their  growth 
and development. The importance of education cannot be overstated, as it enables children 
to  acquire  knowledge,  skills,  and  values  that  are  necessary  for  their  personal  and  social 
development. The right to education for children is enshrined in various international and 
national laws, including the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) 
and the Indian Constitution. Article 26 of the UNCRC recognizes the right of every child 
to  an  education,  which  should  be  directed  to  the  development  of  the  child’s  personality, 
talents, and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential. The Indian Constitution 
also recognizes the right to education as a fundamental right under article 21A, which was 
inserted by the 86th Amendment Act in 2002. This amendment made free and compulsory 
education a fundamental right for children between the ages of 6 and 14 years.

It has been more than a decade since the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 
2009  (RTE Act)  was  enacted  to  enforce  the  fundamental  right  to  education  for  children 
between six and fourteen years of age. Since then, India’s disability rights framework has 
also evolved to enforce obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. With the passage of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 
2016 (RPWD Act), inclusive education got statutory backing in India.

However,  even  as  legal  standards  that  guarantee  the  right  to  education  for  children 
with  disabilities  have  evolved  in  India,  several  inconsistencies  exist.  As  a  result  of  the 
inconsistencies,  there’s  a  lack  of  clarity  in  what  ‘inclusion’  means  in  terms  of  quality 
education for children with disabilities, leading to challenges in on-ground implementation 
of the laws.

The Bill seeks to focus on inclusive education by amending the definition of children with 
disability who have been identified as specially abled or divyangjan by the Honorable Prime 
Minister and we need to reform laws concerning education to provide them accessibility and 
a feasible environment which will take care of their special needs. We also need to focus on 
pre school education and the Bill also makes pre school education mandatory and the onus 
for the same is on the government.

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

At present, reservation is available for persons belonging to the Other backward Classes, 
the  Scheduled  Castes  and  the  Scheduled  Tribes  in  service  and  posts  under  the  Central 
Government.  The  number  of  posts  and  appointments  in  Government  sector  come  down 
considerably, especially after the economic liberalization. Today, private sector has become 
more important and job oriented. In such scenario, the private sector is more involved in 
the  nation  building  activities  alongwith  infrastructure  and  economical  projects.  People 
belonging to Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes find it very 
difficult to get into Government service due to availability of less number of posts.

Under  the  provisions  of  article  16(4)  and  16(4A)  of  the  Constitution,  Public  Sector 
Undertakings  (PSU)  including  Public  Sector  Banks  under  the  Central  Government  and 
Financial  Institutions  are  following  the  instructions  issued  by  the  Government  of  India 
mutatis  mutandis.  Implementation  of  the  Provisions  or  reservation  is  a  pre-requisite  for 
such voluntary organizations, autonomous bodies/institutions etc. where the body receiving 
grant-in-aid, employs  more than twenty people on regular basis and minimum fifty per cent. 
of its recurring expenditure is met by grant-in-aid of the Central Government and such body 
should be a registered society of any cooperative society and should be in receipt of rupees 
two lakh or more from the Consolidated Fund of India as annual grant-in-aid for general 
purpose. 

There are several schemes and special provision in the country for the welfare of the 
people belonging to the Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. 
However, in spite of all these measures, there has not been any big change visible in their 
socio-economic status. In this situation, their presence is very vital in the private sector in 
order to ensure their all-round development.

At present, there is no provision for reservation of persons belonging to Other Backward 
Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in private sector. However, the Government 
also  cannot  pressurise  them  to  provide  reservation.  In  such  a  scenario,  the  private  sector 
can be incentivised to provide reservation to persons belonging to Other backward Classes, 
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes by way of making provisions for concessions and 
special schemes. 

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

States,  cities  and  villages  face  immense  economic,  demographic  and  environmental 
challenges that prompt the public and private sectors to rethink their conduct of business. 
These challenges share an underlying need for modern, efficient and reliable infrastructure 
as well as optimal land use. 

  With  an  enhanced  expenditure  on  capital,  there  is  a  multiplier  effect  that  leads  to 
millions of jobs generated in building and maintenance of the infrastructure as well as scope 
for easier and faster migration. This also provides for more effective delivery of services 
through last mile connectivity. Moreover, by connecting supply chains, these infrastructures 
enhance trade, commerce, tourism and travel by reducing costs of logistics and facilitating 
connectivity. 

For  the  entire  country  to  grow,  we  need  to  enhance  connectivity  at  all  levels  of 
administration  and  governance  which  requires  a  reassessment  of  potential  infrastructural 
spaces of development. The need is to create a Greenfield Infrastructure Board in each of 
the six zones of the country. 

  Greenfield  Infrastructure  refers  to  the  infrastructure  developed  on  empty  land  or 
previously undeveloped land and a project whose commissioning, planning and construction 
process is carried out from the scratch and grass route level.

 The Board shall be entrusted with carrying out an initial survey and developing a plan 
with a five year perspective to identify areas where a greenfield project can be developed, 
fix priorities as per the need to enhance the connectivity in Economically Backward regions 
first as well as coordinate to remove constraints related to provision of land and space and 
monitor the flow of funds. The need is also to assess the Central, Centrally Sponsored or 
State schemes and programmes wherein the requisite infrastructure can be built and include 
the same in the plan. 

It is also necessary that each Board shall have representation from the Central and State 
Governments including the Members of Parliament and Members, Legislative Assemblies. 
The Boards shall be required to meet at least twice a year to monitor the progress of the 
projects. They shall also be required to submit the plans developed by them to the Central 
Government and record all meetings to disseminate the information to all stakeholders. 

The Bill, therefore, seeks to assess the land in the entire country to identify areas for 
development of greenfield infrastructure to facilitate development of backward regions as 
well as support the entire economy through enhanced trade and commerce.

 Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  constitution  of  the  Greenfield  Infrastructure 
Development Boards in each of the six zones in the country. It also provides for appointment 
of specialists, dedicated officers and other employees to each Board. Clause 7 of the Bill 
provides  for  the  Central  Government  to  provide  adequate  fund.  The  Bill,  therefore,  if 
enacted, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India.  It is estimated 
that a recurring expenditure of about rupees two crore and fourty thousand per annum would 
be involved from the Consolidated Fund of India. 

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees sixty lakh is also likely to be incurred for 

survey.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause  9  of  the  Bill  empowers  the  Central  Government  to  make  rules  regarding  the 
qualifications,  experience,  functions,  powers,  and  terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  the 
officers and other employees of the Boards, the time and place of the meetings of the Boards 
and the procedure to be followed at such meetings, etc. As the matters in respect of which 
rules may be made by the Central Government are matters of procedure and administrative 
details only, the delegation of legislative power is, therefore, of a normal character.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Rational thought and critical thinking are the bedrock of a progressive and informed 
society.  In  recognizing  the  fundamental  importance  of  fostering  intellectual  curiosity, 
logical reasoning, and evidence-based decision-making, the proposed Bill seeks to:—

 (
a)  emphasize  the  integration  of  curricula  and  teaching  methodologies  in 
educational  institutions  that  focus  on  nurturing  critical  thinking  skills,  logical 
reasoning, and scientific inquiry; 

b)  foster  an  environment  that  encourages  questioning  and  analysis  aimed  to 

 (
empower individuals with the tools necessary for sound decision-making;

c) promote the use of empirical evidence and rational analysis  in government 
 (
policies, public programmes, and societal initiatives, evidence-based decision-making 
to ensure that decisions are grounded in facts rather than unsupported opinions;

d)  cultivate  a  culture  that  values  intellectual  discourse,  respectful  debate,  and 
 (
open-mindedness by encouraging individuals to engage in constructive conversations 
based  on  reason  and  evidence  and  seeks  to  build  a  society  that  celebrates  diverse 
perspectives while upholding the principles of rational thought;

e)  recognize  the  influential  role  of  media  in  shaping  public  opinion,  by 

 (
encouraging media organizations to contribute to the promotion of rational thought;

f)  provide  platforms  for  well-informed  discussions  and  fact-based  reporting  is 

 (
essential in countering misinformation and promoting public understanding;

 (
g) advance our understanding of cognitive processes and effective educational 
methodologies,  allocate  resources  to  support  research  in  areas  such  as  cognitive 
science and logical reasoning as a commitment to research is essential for continually 
refining educational practices that enhance rational thought;

 (h) establish a monitoring and evaluation mechanism to assess the impact of its 

provisions on society; and

 (
i) submission of reports to the Parliament to provide insights into the progress 
made and areas requiring further attention, ensuring the continuous improvement of 
initiatives promoting rational thought. 

In conclusion, the proposal  "Promotion of Rational Thought Bill" is a forward-looking 
legislative  initiative  aimed  at  fortifying  the  intellectual  foundations  of  our  society.  By 
prioritizing critical thinking, evidence-based decision-making, and a culture of reasoned 
discourse, the Act envisions a society better equipped to navigate the complexities of the 
modern world. 

Hence this Bill.

 FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 5 of the Bill provides that Central Government to provide requisite resources 
for  research  on  cognitive  science,  logical  reasoning  and  educational  methodologies.  
Clause 6 provides for constitution of Board for the promotion of rational thought and critical 
thinking.  Clause  10  provides  that  the  Central  Government  shall  provide  adequate  funds  
for  implementing  the  provisions  of  the  Bill.  The  Bill,  therefore,  if  enacted  will  involve 
expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated that a sum of rupees two 
hundred  and  fifty  crore  will  be  involved  as  recurring  expenditure  per  annum  from  the 
Consolidated Fund of India. 

A non-recurring expenditure of rupees one hundred crore is also likely to be involved.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The Preamble of the Constitution of India speaks of a solemn resolution to secure to all 
of its citizens, amongst other things, justice.  Of the entire apparatus put in place to ensure 
timely  delivery  of  justice,  the  most  crucial  component  is  the  human  resource  element— 
the  advocate.  Even  after  75  years  after  the  country’s  freedom  there  is  no  social  security 
scheme for advocates.The importance of the role of advocates is unquestionable and their 
role in shaping our society, already acknowledged. Therefore, the well-being of lawyers and 
a plan for their social security is a matter of grave concern and one that demands the closest 
attention of the Government, Bar Councils, the Bar and the legal fraternity at large. 

The  primary  aim  of  the Advocates Act,  1961,  is  to  constitute  a  single  class  of  legal 
practitioners, ‘Advocates’ as well as to introduce the powers of the Bar Council of India 
and the State Bar Council. According to this Act, only Advocates, who are enrolled in the 
Bar  Council,  have  the  power  to  practice  the  law  in  the  court. With  the  enactment  of  the 
Advocate’s Welfare Fund Act, 2001, some steps were sought to be taken in this direction. 
Ineffective implementation of its provisions, however, has rendered it almost defunct.

This  seeks  to  amend  the Advocates Act,  1961  with  a  view  to  constitute Advocates’ 
Social Security Welfare Fund and the rules for the disbursement funds to be made by the 
Central or the State Government to create a financial security net for the advocates who have 
retired from practicing because of their age or illness and to the young lawyers who have just 
started out in the profession for their sustenance.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for constitution of the Advocates' Social Security Fund 
to  be  managed  by  the  Central  Government.  It  also  provides  for  the  Central  Government 
to  provide  grants  for  the  fund.  The  Bill,  if  enacted,  will  involve  expenditure  from  the 
Consolidated Fund of India. However, at this stage it is not possible to calculate the exact 
amount which is likely to be incurred towards recurring and non-recurring expenditure for 
the purpose.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

India  is  a  welfare  State  and  it  is  the  duty  of  the  State  to  ensure  that  all  sections 
of  the  society  are  covered  by  a  State  sponsored  social  security  network.  On  account  of 
their unorganized nature of profession artists do not get adequate social security. There is 
practically no welfare scheme for their benefit. There is an urgent need to enact a legislation 
to provide for social security and welfare of the artists so that they can live a life of comfort 
and dignity. 

The present Bill provides for:— 

(a)  empowering  the  Central  Government  to  formulate  welfare  schemes  for  the 
artists; 

(b)  constitution  of  a  Board  to  be  known  as  the  National Artists  Social  Security 
Advisory  Board  to  recommend  the  Government  to  formulate  and  implement 
suitable schemes for welfare of artists; and 

(c) constitution of a Welfare fund to be known as National Artists Welfare Fund in 
order to provide social security to the artists in the country. 

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

Clause 4 provides for constitution of the National Artists' Social Security Advisory 
Board. Clause 6 provides for constitution of a Fund to be known as a National Artists Welfare 
Fund  by  the  Central  Government.  Clause  7  provides  for  supply  of  fund  by  the  Central 
Government. The Bill, therefore, if enacted, will involve expenditure from the Consolidated 
Fund of India. At this stage, it is difficult to give an exact estimate of expenditure likely to 
be involved as the exact amount of expenditure likely to be involved will depend upon the 
number of schemes formulated by the Government. However, it is estimated that an annual 
recurring expenditure of about rupees five hundred crore is likely to be involved from the 
Consolidated Fund of India. 

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees two hundred crore is also likely to be 

involved.

 
 
 
MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 10 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying 
out  the  purposes  of  the Act.  Since  the  rules will  relate  to  the  matters  of  detail  only. The 
delegation of legislative power is, of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

India  generates  close  to  26000  tonnes  of  plastic  a  day. A  little  over  10000  tonnes  of 
plastic  waste  remains  uncollected  and  these  uncollected  waste  eventually  ends  of  in  the 
natural environment in our seas and oceans piling up on our lands. By 2050 the amount of 
plastic in seas and oceans across the world will weigh more than all the marginal creatures. 
At less than 11 kg India’s per capital plastic consumption is nearly a tenth of the United 
States, at 109 kg. Nearly one sixth of the plastic waste is generated by 60 cities and half 
of this comes from Delhi, Mumbai, Bangaluru, Chennai and Kolkata. The National Green 
Tribunal has also rapped 25 cities in U.P. for not following its order on submitting a plan on 
how they would comply with the plastic waste management.

Plastic  is  highly  non-biodegradable  causing  permanent  damage  to  the  environment 
by disrupting ecosystems. Single-use plastic can block waterways and exacerbate natural 
disasters.  By  clogging  sewers  and  providing  breeding  grounds  for  mosquitoes  and  pests, 
plastic bags can increase the transmission of vector borne diseases like Malaria. Troubles 
with single use plastic came to the fore during floods in various parts of the country on the 
source of pollution as addition to landfills is adversely impacting the already frail ecological 
balance. Heaps of plastic wastes were washed ashore highlighting the lack of awareness and 
infrastructure to effectively deal with the product.

Efforts to ban single-use plastic and promote sustainable alternatives to it can help in 
mitigating  the  ill-effects  on  human  life  and  environment.  India’s  commitment  towards 
sustainable development can only be realized through concerted efforts to reduce pollution 
caused by plastic. 

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  4  of  the  Bill  provides  for  research  by  higher  education  institutions  and  other 
into  sustainable  alternatives  to  plastic  packaging.  Clause  5  provides  that  the  appropriate 
Government shall take measures to recycling, reuse and other forms of waste recovery in 
relation to plastic. Clause 8 of the Bill provides that the Central Government shall provide 
requisite funds for carrying out the purpose of this Act. The Bill, therefore, if enacted will 
involve expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund of India and at this stage it is not possible 
to estimate that figures. No non-recurring expenditure is like to be involved.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

India is the land of many great rivers. Disaster such as floods occur in almost all river 
basins of the country. The water resources of the country are not being fully utilized. Every 
year  there  are  floods  in  some  parts  of  the  country  which  cause  immense  loss  of  life  and 
property. It has been observed that at the same time, there is flood in one part of the country 
and the other part is affected by drought. The national resources are damaged by floods and 
drought. The problem, therefore, needs to be addressed urgently to mitigate the affects of 
floods and droughts. 

Therefore,  it  is  expedient  in  public  interest  to  evolve  an  integrated  and  scientific 
approach to deal with the problem of frequent occurrence of floods and drought and to draw 
out a national plan fixing priorities for implementation of strategies in the future. 

The  Bill  seeks  to  provide  for  the  constitution  of  a  National  Flood  Control  Board  to 

suggest measures to prevent flood and deal with the problem of drought in the country. 

Hence this Bill.

New Delhi;                                                                                      ALOK KUMAR SUMAN

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for constitution of a National Flood and Drought Control 
Board. Clause 4 provides inter alia for a time bound action plan for inter-linking of rivers 
and installing of flood forecasting system. Clause 5 provides that the expenditure incurred 
on implementation of the provisions of this Act shall be borne by the Central Government 
and State Governments. The Bill, therefore, if enacted, would involve expenditure from the 
Consolidated Fund of India. It is likely to involve a recurring expenditure of about rupees 
one hundred crore per annum. 

A  non-recurring  expenditure  of  about  rupees  one  hundred  crore  is  also  likely  to  be 

incurred.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause  8  of  the  Bill  empowers  the  Central  Government  to  frame  rules  for  carrying 
out the purposes of the Bill. The rules will relate to matters of detail only and as such the 
delegation of legislative power is, therefore, of a normal character.

(b)  for sub-section (2), the following sub-section shall be substituted, namely:–

(2)  Every  person  who  has  done  the  work  given  to  him  shall  be  entitled

at such wage rate for each day of work as may be determined, whichever is 
higher.”.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  Mahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee Act,  2005  is  a  social 
security legislation that provides employment for rural population and ensuring minimum 
number of employment days.

We all are aware that India is a Welfare State and Indian Constitution itself stipulates 
desirable implementation of the provision of Directive Principle of State Policy as enshrined 
in Part-IV of the Constitution. Even in Fundamental Rights as enshrined Part-III provides 
the right to a decent living, which is not possible without adequate means of living with 
gainful employment. 

The  number  of  working  days  and  wages  being  given  under  the  Mahatma  Gandhi 
National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee Act  is  at  present  very  less.  Keeping  in  view,  the 
current  rate  of  inflation,  the  wages  needs  to  be  enhanced  to  an  amount  of  rupees  seven 
hundred per day and also there is need to enhance the number of days of employment under 
the Act to two hundred and fifty days. 

Hence this Bill.

New Delhi;                                                                                    C. N. ANNADURAI 

July 3, 2024

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 2 of the Bill provides for increasing the number of days of employment of the 
registered persons from one hundred days to two hundred and fifty days under the Act. It 
also provides for ensuring minimum wage of registered persons to rupees seven hundred 
for each day of work. The Bill, therefore, if enacted would involve expenditure from the 
Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated that a recurring expenditure of about rupees ten 
lakh crore per annum is likely to be involved from the Consolidated Fund of India.

No non-recurring expenditure is likely to be involved.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

India is the world’s largest populated country and hosts pluralism in culture, religion, 
ethnicity, language and multilayered caste system which often imposes challenges on the 
Indian Government to structure and manage a harmonious society. The challenges include 
creating  equal  employment  opportunities,  providing  and  allocating  equal  distribution  of 
resources  and  funds  of  the  government  and  making  education  available  to  all  citizens 
of  India  without  discrimination  on  the  grounds  of  their  religion,  caste,  race,  sex,  
socio-economic  background  etc.  In  order  to  overcome  such  challenges,  the  government 
uses reservation as a tool for the smooth administration of the country. 

The term reservation can be described as ‘certain policy measures or the techniques 
adopted by the Indian governance in order to empower, promote and uplift those social 
segments  or  members  of  community  which  have  remained  backward,  or  discriminated, 
or  historically  oppressed,  by  reserving  their  access  to  seats  or  quota  for  admission  into 
educational institutes, in governmental jobs and legislatures. 

Students  from  government  schools  and  those  studying  in  private  schools  hail  from 
different  socio-economic  backgrounds.  Considering  these  disparities,  it  would  be  unfair 
to weigh them on an equal footing. Students from government schools must get access to 
quality education and a chance to fulfil their dreams. Those who are brilliant must not be 
stopped because of social or economic boundaries. Professional courses are the stepping 
stone  towards  a  bright  future  of  young  talents  in  the  country.  Providing  reservation  to 
students from government schools in Central Educational Institutions would be a step in the 
right direction considering the principles of equality under article 14 and non-discrimination 
under article 15 as enshrined under the Constitution of India. If implemented across the 
country, this reservation policy may also help in increasing the enrolments in government 
schools. 

Affirmative action by the Government is the need of the hour to place students from all 
walks of life at an equal footing to secure their future and thereby ensure that students from 
weaker socio-economic backgrounds do not suffer in the long run. Suitable amendment is, 
therefore, required in the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 
2006.

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) represent a significant public health concern affecting 
individuals  across  the  globe,  transcending  geographical,  cultural,  and  socioeconomic 
boundaries. ASD is characterized by a range of neuro-developmental conditions that impact 
an  individual’s  ability  to  engage  in  social  interaction,  communication,  and  may  involve 
repetitive behaviors. Recognizing the unique challenges faced by individuals with ASD and 
the necessity for early intervention and support, the proposed “Autism Spectrum Disorders 
(Recognition and Treatment) Act” aims to address the following issue: 

The Bill seeks to establish a framework for the early recognition of Autism Spectrum 
Disorders. This  includes  the  development  and  implementation  of  awareness  programs  to 
educate  healthcare  professionals,  educators,  and  the  general  public  about  the  early  signs 
of  ASD.  Timely  identification  is  crucial  for  initiating  interventions  that  enhance  the 
developmental outcomes for individuals with ASD. 

The  legislation  aims  to  ensure  that  individuals  diagnosed  with  Autism  Spectrum 
Disorders have access to a comprehensive range of medical, educational, and therapeutic 
interventions. This involves the promotion of specialized training programs for healthcare 
professionals, teachers, and caregivers to enhance their capacity to provide tailored support 
services. 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  ongoing  research  to  deepen  our  understanding  of 
ASD, the Act encourages and supports research initiatives focused on the various aspects 
of Autism  Spectrum  Disorders. Additionally,  the  establishment  of  a  national  database  is 
proposed to systematically collect and analyze data on the prevalence and characteristics of 
ASD, providing a foundation for evidence-based policymaking. 

The Bill proposes a legal framework to enforce compliance with its provisions. Penalties 
are  prescribed  for  individuals  or  institutions  found  in  violation  of  the Act,  thus  ensuring 
accountability and adherence to the established norms. 

The proposed legislation takes into account international best practices in the recognition 
and  treatment  of Autism Spectrum Disorders. By  aligning  with global  standards, the Act 
aims to contribute to the creation of a supportive and inclusive environment for individuals 
with ASD. 

In conclusion, the Bill is a significant step towards creating an inclusive society that 
recognizes and supports the unique needs of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders. 
By fostering early intervention, access to appropriate services, and promoting research, the 
Act aims to improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. 

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for conducting awareness programes to educate the public, 
healthcare professional and educators about the  early science of ASD. Clause 4 provides 
for research and maintenance of database on Autism Spectrum Disorder. Clause 5 provides 
for  the  Central  Government  to  give  adequate  funds  to  the  States.  The  Bill,  therefore,  if 
enacted, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is estimated that 
a recurring expenditure of about rupees two hundred and fifty crore would be involved from 
the Consolidated Fund of India per annum. 

A  non-recurring  expenditure  of  about  rupees  one  hundred  crore  is  also  likely  to  be 

involved.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause 7 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out 
the purposes of this Act.  As the rules and regulations will relate to matters of detail only, the 
delegation of legislative power, is therefore, of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  exorbitant  increase  in  airfare  has  been  recognized  as  a  serious  issue  ever  since 
the airline sector has been de-regulated. With the repeal of Air Corporations Act in March, 
1994, airlines are free to fix reasonable tariffs under the provisions of sub-rule (1) of Rule 
135 of Aircraft Rules, 1937. Therefore, there is no regulating and monitoring mechanism 
to rationalize the airfare without affecting the passengers. In some sectors, the Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation has created ‘Tariff Monitoring Unit’. But these units only ensure 
that the fares charged by the airlines are within the prescribed tariffs of the airlines displayed 
on their websites. As a result, the airlines often charge excessive rates particularly during 
festival or holiday seasons. 

The  airfare  is  dynamic  in  nature  and  follows  the  principle  of  demand  and  supply. 
Besides, the airline companies are always influenced by shareholder interests and revenue 
management  rather  than  passenger  concern  and  affordability.  All  these  issues  seriously 
affect the passengers. The expatriates who work in the Gulf region are often the victims of 
this unscrupulous airfare charges as they are forced to pay three to four times of the regular 
fare during vacations reasons.

Realizing  the  gravity  of  the  situation,  the  Parliamentary  Committee  on  Transport, 
Tourism and Culture have also expressed their concern on the self-regulating mechanism 
of the current airline monitoring regime which is inadequate to address the financial burden 
of the passengers on the one hand and the predatory tariff structure of the airline companies 
on the other. The Committee also suggested the establishment of a quasi-judicial entity to 
regulate and monitor the air tariff in an ethical and equitable manner. Since there is no such 
monitoring agency to regulate the airfare in the current context of liberalized economy, there 
is an urgent need to set up an apex authority with all the relevant powers and functions to 
regulate the airfare dynamics and fix an upper limit to the maximum tariff. The establishment 
of the Airfare Regulatory Board would be the right direction in this regard.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  3  of  the  Bill provides  for  the  establishment of  the Airfare  Regulatory Board. 
It also provides for the appointment of a Chairperson, members, officers, staff and experts 
to the Board. Clause 7 provides for the Central Government to provide funds to the Board 
for  carrying  out  the  purposes  of  this Act.  The  Bill,  therefore,  if  enacted,  would  involve 
expenditure  from  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  India.  It  is  estimated  that  about  rupees  one 
hundred crore will be incurred per annum from the Consolidated Fund of India.

A non-recurring expenditure of about rupees fifty crore is also likely to be involved.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREGA) Act, 2005 
is perhaps the most significant social policy initiative in India since independence. The main 
objective  of  the Act  is  to  provide  enhancement  of  livelihood  security  of  the  households 
in rural areas by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment to 
every household in unskilled manual work. Ever since its inception, the rural employment 
guarantee program has provided lifeline to the poor households in the rural areas, especially 
during the periods of rural distress. 

While  the  country  is  witnessing  an  alarming  rate  of  unemployment  with  limited 
job  opportunities  in  manufacturing  sector,  there  is  a  high  demand  for  the  jobs  under  the 
MGNREGA  Scheme.  But  the  existing  provisions  of  the  Act  are  unable  to  address  the 
growing  aspirations  of  the  rural  poor.  For  example,  the  average  wage  rate  for  unskilled 
manual  workers  under  the  program  has  been  growing  at  a  sluggish  pace  since  2018-19. 
The average wage rate was Rs. 207 in 2018- 19, growing to Rs. 259 in 2023-24. The slight 
increase in wage rate is insufficient to meet the increase in cost of basic goods, which have 
risen due to spike in inflation in the last few years. 

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Rural Development and Panchayati Raj in 
2021-22 critically noted that the fluctuations and huge disparity in wage rates among the 
States are unjustified. Hence, there is a need to rise the lower limit of the wage rate under the 
scheme in such a way that it can guarantee a decent income which can manage the chronic 
of price rice. While considering the existing wage rate of different States, it is understood 
that a minimum wage of rupees four hundred would be a balanced amount to be fixed for 
a day’s work. Besides, the last few years have witnessed significant increase in demand for 
job across the country. Therefore, there is a need to guarantee at least one hundred and fifty 
days of employment instead of one hundred days.

Considering  the  changing  dynamics  of  the  unemployment  situation,  rural  distress 
and chronic inflation in the country, it is envisaged that increasing the days of guaranteed 
employment to one hundred and fifty days and fixing the minimum wage rate at rupees four 
hundred would transform the lives of the rural poor substantially. 

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 2 of the Bill provide for increasing the days of guaranteed employment under 
the Act from existing one hundred days to one hundred and fifty days. Clause 3 provides for 
fixing the minimum wages to at least rupees four hundred per day. Clause 4 provides for the 
State Government to increase the number of days of guaranteed employment in a financial 
year to every household in the rural areas under the Scheme from existing one hundred days 
to one hundred and fifty days. Clause 6 provides for the specifying the minimum wage rate 
from existing sixty rupees per day to four hundred rupees per day. Clause 7 provides for 
the State Government to pay unemployment allowance to a household from existing one 
hundred days to one hundred and fifty days. Clause 8 provides for increasing the days of 
guaranteed employment under the Act from existing one hundred days to one hundred and 
fifty days. The Bill, therefore, if enacted will involve expenditure from the Consolidated 
Fund of India.  It is estimated that a recurring expenditure of about rupees fifty crore would 
be involved from the Consolidated Fund of India per annum.

A  non-recurring  expenditure  of  about  rupees  one  hundred  crore  is  also  likely  to  be 

involved.

   (3) Every rule made by the State Government under this Act shall be laid, as soon as

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

While a large number of primary, middle and secondary schools have been established, 

the students, especially in big cities, have to face hardships in securing admission to senior 

secondary schools because, in most of the cases, the last attended school imparts education 

upto primary, middle or secondary level. Students are compelled to run to district education 

office, schools and other authorities to get recommendations or relevant certificates to fulfil 

the  formalities  for  admission  in  senior  secondary  schools.  In  such  a  situation,  it  is  quite 

natural that the children as well as parents have to suffer mental agony.

Therefore,  it  has  become  necessary  in  the  public  interest  to  provide  for  the 

establishment  of schools imparting education from  classes  first to twelfth or  upgrade the 

existing primary, middle or secondary level schools to senior secondary level.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  provides  for  establishment  of  adequate  number  of  schools  or 

upgrade the existing primary, middle or secondary level schools upto senior secondary lev-

el. Clause 4 provides that the appropriate Government shall bear the cost of admission and 

all other expenditure including providing of free of cost books, notebooks, stationary item, 

hostel facility and scholarship to the students enrolled in schools. Clause 7 provides that 

the  Central  Government  shall  provide  funds  to  the  State  Governments  for  establishment 

of schools. The Bill, if enacted, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of 

India. It is likely to involve a recurring expenditure of about rupees fifty crore per annum. 

A  non-recurring  expenditure  of  about  rupees  seventy  five  crore  is  also  likely  to  be

 involved.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 9 of the Bill empowers the appropriate Government to make rules for carrying 
out the purposes of the Bill. As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, the delegation 
of legislative power is of a normal character.

2

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  Forty-second Amendment Act,  1976  was  a  seminal  legislation  that  added  many 
seminal worker and downtrodden friendly provisions to the constitution. One such Article 
hitherto inserted is the Article 43A. It seeks to promote the involvement of labour in the way 
industries and other enterprises are being run. It is well known that the plantation labour in 
India is one of the most marginalised sections amidst the labour community. Despite their 
whole  lives  dedicated  to  the  upkeep  of  the  plantation  estates,  they  seldom  get  the  fruits 
of their labour. They live in sub-human conditions with scant avenues for social mobility. 
There is a need for an urgent intervention to make sure that they get a fair share of their 
labour by getting an opportunity to be part of the management. 

The Bill seeks to achieve this aim.

Hence this Bill.

following entry shall be inserted, namely:–

Short title.

Amendment 
of the Eighth 
Schedule.

“3. Bhojpuri.”.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Bhojpuri language which originated in the Gangetic plains of India is a very old and rich 
language having its origin in the Sanskrit language. Bhojpuri is the mother tongue of a large 
number of people residing in Uttar Pradesh, Western Bihar, Jharkhand and some parts of 
Madhya Pradesh as well as in several other countries. In Mauritius, this language is spoken 
by a large number of people. It is estimated that around one hundred forty million people 
speak Bhojpuri. Bhojpuri films are very popular in the country and abroad and have deep 
impact on the Hindi film industry. 

Bhojpuri  language  has  a  rich  literature  and  cultural  heritage.  The  great  scholar 
Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan wrote some of his work in Bhojpuri. There have been some 
other eminent writers of Bhojpuri like Viveki Rai and Bhikhari Thakur, who is popularly 
known  as  the  “Shakespeare  of  Bhojpuri”.  Some  other  eminent  writers  of  Hindi  such  as 
Bhartendu Harishchandra, Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi and Munshi Premchand were deeply 
influenced by Bhojpuri literature. Bhojpuri language and its literature is gaining new heights 
because of the efforts made by various scholars. 

Many  personalities  with  Bhojpuri  background  have  achieved  highest  positions  in  the 
country. Various  International  Conferences  have  been  organized  to  promote  Bhojpuri. At 
present Indira Gandhi National Open University is planning to start a certificate course in 
Bhojpuri  language.  Recently,  the  Bhojpuri  study  centre  had  been  established  in  Banaras 
Hindu  University  to  propagate  and  develop  the  Bhojpuri  language.  In  Uttar  Pradesh  and 
Bihar, movements have been initiated to give Bhojpuri language its due place. 

But it is unfortunate that the “Bhojpuri” language is yet to find a place in the Eighth 

Schedule to the Constitution. 

For the promotion of literacy and the development of this language, it is necessary that 

this language be included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. 

Hence this Bill.

  (2)  The  State  shall,  through  such  enforcement  agencies  as  it  consider  necessary,

3.  In  article  51A  of  the  Constitution,  for  clause  (g),  the  following  clause  shall  be 

substituted, namely:—

5

 “(g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers 
and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures and to actively participate in 
the State’s endeavour to promote the forest cover in the country to forty per cent. of the 
total geographical area.”.

 
 
STATEMENT  OF  OBJECTS  AND  REASONS

Forests  are  key  to  all  forms  of  life. They  provide  for  the  continuity  of  the  world’s 
biodiversity  which  is  necessary  for  economic  development,  human  livelihood,  medical 
discoveries, and to provide environmental adaptive responses. Forests are also important 
because  they  stabilize  climate,  prevent  soil  erosion,  watershed  protection  and  provides 
habitat to thousands of life forms. Despite our dependence on forests, we are still allowing 
them to disappear.

India accounts for about 2.4 per cent. of the total geographical area of the world and 
is also home to 17 per cent. of the world population. India is one of the richest countries in 
the world in terms of biodiversity making it one of the Mega-diverse countries accounting 
for nearly 8 per cent. of the species of the world. It is estimated that nearly 1/3rd of Indian 
plants are endemic, being found nowhere else in the world.

To  promote  this  diversity  and  economic  growth  the  National  Forest  Policy,  1952 
emphasized on the extension of forest and tree cover by proposing that 33% of the total 
geographical  area  should  be  under  forest  tree  cover.  The  National  Forest  Policy,  1988 
which was formulated four years before the Earth Summit 1992 embodies the principles 
of sustainable forest management and mandated an increase in the forest/tree cover in the 
country to 33 per cent. of the land area. However, according to the India State of Forest 
Report (ISFR) 2017, the total forest cover is 7,08,273 Sq. Km. which is only 21.54 per cent. 
of the total geographical area of the country. Forest and tree cover combined is 8,02,088 Sq. Km. 
and is 24.39 per cent. of the total geographical area.

The Bill proposes to conserve the natural heritage of the country by preserving the 
remaining natural forests and at the same time also promote the increase in the forest cover 
with the vast variety of flora and fauna by ensuring that the State with active participation 
of the citizens will be able to preserve and promote the remarkable biological diversity 
and genetic resources of the country. It also enable the country to meet our climate change 
targets without any binding obligations.

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

India has more than 50 percent of its population below the age of twenty-five and more 
than  65  percent  below  the  age  of  thirty-five.  The  country’s  median  age  is  twenty-eight. 
India  as  a  country  is  young.  However,  its  leaders  are  not. The  average  age  of  an  Indian 
parliamentarian is fifty-five. In particular, young citizens are an “excluded majority” with 
an insufficient presence. Today, those under the age of thirty-five represent more than half 
of the world’s population but in political office, as elected representatives, they are a clear 
minority. This in itself is a democratic deficit. 

If  voters  are  seeking  representatives  who  reflect  their  interests,  they  may  choose 
candidates  who  are  roughly  their  age.  This  proactive  measure  of  reserving  seats  in  the 
House of the People will send a signal to our youth that they also have a place in politics. 
Young adults need representatives whom they can relate to, and who are sensitive to their 
aspirations and motivated to raise issues that impact them as well. Our youth population is 
one of the largest in the world and this creates a demographic dividend that could play a 
significant role in making India a developed nation.

As a young country, we should aim to include the youth in our legislative procedures 
and discussions, making them the custodians of their own future. They can be indispensable 
in crafting policies that are futuristic and take into account new and emerging challenges. If 
India desires to become a world leader, it must make a conscious effort to give its youth a 
chance to voice their opinions as an integral part of the House of the People.

Thus, in order to facilitate greater participation of young Indians as public representatives 
in  policy-making  at  the  national  level,  it  is  imperative  to  introduce  this  constitutional 
amendment to provide for ten seats of the total number of seats in the House of the People 
for individuals under the age of 35 years who have presented themselves to the electorate in 
the general elections but failed to secure the election in their own right from a constituency. 
These ten unsuccessful candidates under the age of 35 years with the best voting percentage 
in  their  constituencies  shall  be  deemed  elected,  and  these  ten  seats  would  be  considered 
reserved.

Hence this Bill.

India by promoting a sense of fraternity that is firmly rooted in the secular ethos of the 
Republic.”.

Short title and 
commencement.

Insertion of new 
article 49A.

Promotion of 
secularism.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
STATEMENT  OF  OBJECTS  AND  REASONS

Indian model of secularism is very different from the European model of secularism. 
It  is  rooted  in  the  ideals  of  cooperation  and  harmonious  existence.  The  State  is  not 
completely  separated  from  religion.  Rather,  the  State  treats  every  religion  equally  and 
promotes an atmosphere of harmonious co-existence. This is because, the founding fathers 
of the republic realised that the State has to play a pro-active role in maintaining the secular 
fabric of the country. The elected Union Government and other organs of the State should 
uphold  the  secular  spirit  of  the  constitution.  But,  the  secular  ethos  of  the  Constitution 
is not something, that could be left to the vagaries of transient electoral majorities. The 
nature  of  Indian  society must be  protected  by inculcating  a spirit  of  fraternity  amongst 
all  communities  that  reside  in  India.  To  ensure  this,  a  constitutional  mandate  must  be 
placed over the elected governments to inculcate the spirit of secularism through school 
and college education.

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  Self-Respect  was  a  social  movement  founded  by  Thanthai  Periyar.  One 
of  the  major  sociological  changes  made  through  the  movement  was  the  self-
respect  marriage  system,  which  encouraged  inter-caste  marriages,  widow  re-marriages 
which were opposed vehemently  by  conservative  groups.  It  was  the  vision  of  Periyar 
to  do  away  with  the  unnecessary  rituals  and  ceremonies  of  conventional  marriages, 
which were often dominated  by  Brahmin  priests  and  often  put  the  families  under  the 
burden  of  debt  and  dowry.  Further,  the  then  Hindu  marriage  ceremonies  were 
conducted  in  Sanskrit,  which the Tamil people did not understand, and hence the rituals 
and practices were based solely on blind adherence.

        Furthermore, due to the prevalent  practice of child marriage and very poor health 
facilities,  there  were  a  high  number  of  widows  in  the  society.  However,  women 
like  Sivagami  Ammaiyar,  who  were  widowed  at  the  age  of  11  years,  were  given  a  new 
lease of life by the widow re-marriage principles of the self-respect movement.

implemented 

    Self-respect  marriages  have  been  in  practice  since  1928.  Tamil  Nadu 
became  the  first  state  to  legalize  Hindu  marriages  conducted  without  a  Brahmin 
priest.  This  was 
the  Hindu  Marriage  Act  (Tamil  Nadu 
Amendment)  Act,  1967 (Tamil  Nadu Act  21  of  1967),  which  inserted  Section  7A  after 
section  7  of  the  Hindu  Marriage  Act,  1955  (Central  Act  25  of  1955),  to  render 
Suyamariyathai  (self-respect)  and  Seerthiruttha  (reformist)  marriages  as  legal  when 
solemnized  in  the  presence  of friends,  relatives.  It  is felt that it would be in the interest 
of the people at large to include this amendment into the Central legislation thus making it 
applicable to the entire country.

through 

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

We are living in a highly iniquitous world where a microscopic minority is 
controlling  huge  assets  and  the  majority  is  poor  and  marginalized.  One  of  the 
major problems faced by the world is of inequality in the distribution of money, 
resources  and  opportunities.  It  is  also  imperative  to  acknowledge  society’s 
obligation  to  guarantee  a  minimum  living  standard  in  times  of  uncertain 
employment generation.  Ensuring universal basic income will help every citizen 
to  gain  some  financial  freedom  and  strive  for his  life  goal.  It  will  provide  the 
necessary material foundation for a life with access to basic goods and a life of 
dignity, but also promote many of the basic values of a society which respects all 
individuals as free and equal.  It will also promote equality by reducing poverty, 
improve  health  conditions  and  educational  outcomes,  promote  efficiency  by 
reducing waste in government transfers and even promote greater productivity. 
The  Bill  aims  to  achieve  an  egalitarian  society  where  individuals  can  lead  a 
dignified and healthy life by providing every citizen the right to universal basic 
income.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  right  of  all  citizens  to  universal  basic 
income. Clause 4 provides for special provisions for people who belong to the below 
poverty line category. Clause 5 provides for special provisions for people without 
any other source of income and clause 6 provides for special provision for meeting 
the nutritional needs of children. Clause 7 provides for constitution of the National 
Advisory Board and Clause 8 (2) provides for the salaries and allowances payable to 
the Chairperson and Members of the Board. Clause 10 (2) of the Bill provides for the 
salaries and allowances of the officers and employees of the Board.  states the duties 
of the appropriate Government. Clause 12 provides that the Central Government shall 
provide  adequate  funds  to  the  Board  for  carrying  out  the  functions  assigned  to  it. 
Clause 14 provides for sharing of financial and other responsibilities between Central 
Government and State Governments. 

The Bill, therefore, if enacted, would involve both non-recurring and recurring 
expenditure  from  the  Consolidated  Fund  of  India.  However,  at  this  juncture,  it  is 
difficult to estimate the actual expenditure likely to be involved. 

7 

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 15 of the Bill empowers the appropriate Government to issue guidelines. 
Clause 18 provides that the appropriate Government may, make such order or give such 
direction, as necessary for removing any difficulty to give effect to the provisions of this 
Bill. Clause 19 empowers the appropriate Government to make rules to carry out the 
provisions of this Bill. 

As  the  guidelines,  orders,  directions  and  rules  will  relate  to  matters  of  details 

only, the delegation of legislative power is of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

Article  263  of  the  Constitution  envisions  the  establishment  and 
functioning  of  the  Inter-State  Council  (ISC),  a  vital  institution  aimed  at 
fostering  cooperative  federalism  and  harmonizing  relations  between  the 
Union and  State  Governments. It is a critical  instrument for strengthening 
our  democratic  fabric  and  promoting  the  principles  of  federalism  as 
enshrined in the Constitution of India. However, the historical trajectory of 
ISC meetings has revealed notable inconsistencies in fulfilling its mandate, 
thereby underscoring the need for reform.  

The  vision  for  this  reform  is  deeply  rooted  in  the  principles  of 
cooperative  federalism,  which  are  essential  for  the  healthy  functioning  of 
our  democracy.  The  Justice  M  M  Punchhi  Commission's  report  in  2010 
emphasized the importance of cooperative federalism and underscored that 
effective  consultation  among  all  levels  of  Government  is  essential  for  its 
success. 

Recognizing that the strained relationship between the Union and 
State  Governments  can  hinder  the  nation's  progress,  the  proposed 
amendments  to  Article  263  are  a  crucial  step  towards  achieving  national 
unity and fostering growth by ensuring a robust and functional mechanism 
for resolving differences and promoting dialogue. 

This  proposal  seeks  to  reinvigorate  the  Inter-State  Council,  in 
alignment  with  the  principles  of  cooperative  federalism,  and  underscores 
the importance of amending Article 263 to empower the ISC in effectively 
addressing inter-State and Union-State Government matters. These reforms 
are pivotal in fostering national growth and unity. 

India's  distinctive  geographic,  climatic,  and  socio-political 
conditions  render  it  susceptible  to  a  wide  range  of  both  natural  and  man-
made  disasters.  The  National  Disaster  Management  Authority's  annual 
reports effectively illustrate our nation's vulnerability. Specific regions, like 
Odisha,  are  recurrently  exposed  to  natural  disasters,  primarily  cyclones. 
These catastrophic events have inflicted substantial economic losses and the 
displacement of marginalized populations nationwide. 

The  comprehensive  scope  of  disaster  management  encompasses 
various  activities,  including  preparedness,  early  warning  systems,  rescue 
operations, relief efforts, and rehabilitation initiatives. Disasters encompass 
a  broad  range,  spanning  natural  calamities,  health-related  crises  such  as 
epidemics  and  pandemics,  industrial  accidents,  and  disasters  arising  from 
hostile  actions,  such  as  terrorism.  Within  this  overarching  framework,  it 
becomes evident that several existing entries in the three lists of legislative 
powers pertain to areas relevant to disaster management. 

For  instance,  "Public  order"  falls  under  the  State  List,  as  does 
"Public Health."  Entries 14 and 17 in the State List pertain to Agriculture 
and Water, respectively.  Environment and Social Security are included in 
the  Concurrent  List,  while  Atomic  Energy  and  Railways  are  part  of  the 

4 

Union List.  Furthermore, after the Constitution 73rd and 74th amendments, 
all civic responsibilities have been delegated to local governing bodies. 

The  Disaster  Management  Act  of  2005  was  enacted  by  the 
Parliament,  invoking  its  jurisdiction  under  entry  23  of  List  III,  which 
pertains  to  "Social  security  and  social  insurance;  employment  and 
unemployment." Many State Governments have subsequently enacted their 
own  legislation  on  similar  lines.  The  proliferation  of  laws  and  the 
dispersion  of  relevant  entries  across  different  lists  result  in  confusion 
regarding  the  allocation  of  legislative  responsibilities  and  resources.  This 
underscores  the  imperative  for  a  specific  entry  related  to  disaster 
management,  aligning  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Venkatachaliah 
Commission in 2002 and the Second Administrative Reforms Commission 
in 2006. 

It  is  therefore,  proposed  to  amend  the  Seventh  Schedule  to  the 
Constitution  with  a  view  to  add  an  entry  “Management  of  Disasters  and 
Emergencies, natural or man-made” in List III (Concurrent List), so that the 
Central Government could play its role in the area of disaster management. 

Language is not merely a tool for communication; it is a vessel of 
human  heritage,  a  repository  of  identity,  history,  culture,  and  traditional 
wisdom.  Recognizing  this  profound  role,  the  Eighth  Schedule  to  the 
Constitution acknowledges 22 languages as national languages, spoken and 
written  by  our  citizens.  However,  it  is  disheartening  to  note  that  tribal 
languages  such  as  Bhumij,  Ho,  Kui,  Mundari,  and  Saora  with  their  rich 
cultural tapestries do not find a place in the Eighth Schedule. 

The linguistic landscape of eastern India is a canvas adorned with 
a  diverse  array  of  indigenous  languages,  each  weaving  its  own  unique 
history and cultural significance. 

Bhumij,  an  Austroasiatic  language,  is  spoken  by  the  Bhumij 
people  in  Jharkhand,  Odisha,  and  West  Bengal.  According  to  the  2011 
census, around 27,506 people speak Bhumij. The script used for Bhumij is 
called Ol Onal and was created by Mahendra Nath Sardar. However, some 
people also use the Bengali script, the Odia alphabet, or Devanagari. 

The  Ho  language  is  spoken  by  the  Ho,  Munda,  Kolha,  and  Kol 
tribal communities in Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, 
and Assam. According to the 2011 census, around 1,421,418 people speak 
Ho.  The  language  is  written  in  Romanized  transcription,  Hindi-based 
Devanagari, Odia script, and the indigenous Warang Chiti script, created by 
Ho  pandit  Lako  Bodra  in  the  early  1950s.  Its  cultural  significance  is 
highlighted  by  its  recognition  by  the  University  Grants  Commission  of 
India (UGC) and its inclusion in UGC exams under the Tribal and Regional 
Language/Literature  group.  Additionally,  Ho  gained  recognition  in  the 
mass media when All India Radio started broadcasting songs and programs 
in the Ho language. 

Kui, a south-central Dravidian language, is spoken by the Kandhas 
in the eastern Indian State of Odisha. According to the 2011 census, around 
941,488 people speak Kui. The language is written in the Odia script. It has 
historical  connections  with  Kuinga,  which  is  closely  linked  to  the  Gondi 
and Kuvi languages. 

5 

The  Munda  tribes  speak  the  Mundari  language  in  the  eastern 
Indian  States  of  Jharkhand,  Odisha,  and  West  Bengal.  According  to  the 
2011 census, approximately 1,128,228 people speak Mundari. It is closely 
related  to  Santali,  and  its  script,  Mundari  Bani,  was  created  by  Rohidas 
including 
Singh  Nag.  The 
Devanagari, Odia, Bengali, and Latin. 

language  is  written 

in  various  scripts, 

Saora is a language spoken by the Sora people, an ethnic group in 
eastern India, mainly in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. According to the 2011 
census, about 409,549 individuals speak Saora. The  language is expressed 
in  various  ways,  including  Odia,  Telugu,  and  Latin  script,  and  the  native 
writing system, Sora Sompeng, created by Mangei Gomango in 1936. The 
region's  cultural  richness  is  reflected  in  the  enduring  presence  of  Saora, 
echoing through time. 

Including Bhumij, Ho, Kui,  Mundari,  and Saora  languages in the 
Eighth  Schedule  will  fulfil  the  long-standing  demands  and  aspirations  of 
the  tribal  communities  speaking  these  five  languages.  To  promote, 
integrate,  and  empower  these  languages,  and  to  safeguard  the  culture  and 
traditions of those who speak them, it is imperative that these languages be 
accorded  the  recognition  they  deserve  by  being  included  in  the  Eighth 
Schedule of the Constitution. 

The Bill seeks to achieve the above-said objectives.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

Article 3 of the Draft Constitution of India 1948 provided that a 
Bill which would form a new State, or increase or diminish the area of 
any  State  or  alter  the  name  or  boundaries  of  any  State  shall  not  be 
introduced in either House of Parliament unless––– 

“(a)  Either- 

(i) A  representation  in  that  behalf  has  been  made  to  the
President  by  a  majority  of  the  representatives  of  the
territory  in  the  Legislature  of  the  State  from  which  the
territory is to be separated or excluded; or

(ii) A  resolution  in  that  behalf  has  been  passed  by  the
Legislature of any State whose boundaries or name will be
affected by the proposal to be contained in the Bill; and

(b) Where  the  proposal  contained  in  the  Bill  affects  the
boundaries or name of any State, other than a State for the time
being specified in Part III of the First Schedule, the views of the
Legislature  of  the  State  both  with  respect  to  the  proposal  to
introduce the Bill and with respect to the provisions thereof have
been  ascertained  by  the  President;  and  where  such  proposal
affects  the  boundaries  or  name  of  any  State  for  the  time  being
specified in Part III of the First Schedule, the previous consent
of the State to the proposal has been obtained.”.

In the Constituent Assembly, Prof. K.T. Shah was of the opinion 
that such proposals must originate in the State Legislature itself and not 
in  the  Parliament.  He  rightly  argued  that,  in  a  democratic  regime, 
people  affected  must  be  consulted  first  and  a  drastic  measure  such  as 
redrawing  boundaries  of  a  State  must  not  be  laid  out  in  a  top-down 
approach. 

Dr.  Ambedkar  then  moved  an  amendment  which  was  adopted 
and made part of the existing article 3 of the Constitution. The proviso 
required that the views of the State Legislature be “ascertained” by the 
President – 

‘Provided  that  no  Bill  for  the  purpose  shall  be  introduced  in 
either House of Parliament except on the recommendation of the 
President and unless– 

(a) where  the  proposal  contained  in  the  Bill  affects  the
boundaries or name of any State or States for the time
being  specified  in  Part  I  of  the  First  Schedule,  the
views  of  the  Legislature  of  the  State,  or  as  the  case
may be, of each of the States both with respect to the
proposal to introduce the Bill and with respect to the
provisions  thereof  have  been  ascertained  by  the
President; and

(b) where  such  proposal  affects  the  boundaries  or  name
of  any  State  or  States  for  the  time  being  specified  in
Part III of the First Schedule, the previous consent of
the State, or as the case maybe, of each of the States
to the proposal has been obtained’.”

3 

Dr. Ambedkar believed that Central Governments would respect 
federal  principles  and  naturally  consult 
the  States  first  before 
jeopardizing  their  status.  However,  by  way  of  the  Constitution  (Fifth 
Amendment)  Act,  1955,  this  aspect  of  ascertainment  of  views  was 
substituted.  The  amended  proviso,  which  forms  part  of  the  existing 
article, provides that State Legislatures are only required to convey their 
views  on  the  recommendation.  The  article,  in  its  current  shape  and 
form, does not give any weightage to the views of the Legislature of the 
State  whose  boundary  or  name  is  proposed  to  be  altered  and  neither 
does any consultation take place prior to the recommendation. 

The entire exercise and the article enabling such an exercise is a 

clear aberration of the scheme of Cooperative Federalism. 

The Bill, therefore, seeks to amend article 3 thereby providing for 
the President to refer the Bill to the Legislative Assembly of the State 
being re-organised for its approval and not merely its views. The State 
Legislative  Assembly  would  have  the  power  to  either  accept  or  reject 
such Bill by way of a simple majority. On rejection, the Bill would not 
be  introduced  in  either  House  of  Parliament  thereby  empowering  the 
States to uphold the aspirations of the people by legitimately exercising 
their veto power in such proposals which they feel affect public interest.  

Hence this Bill.

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2024 

Bill No. XXIV of  2024 

A 

BILL 

further to amend the Constitution of India. 

BE it enacted by Parliament in the Seventy-fifth Year of the Republic of India as 

follows:– 

1.

(1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 2024.

Short  title  and 
commencement. 

(2) It  shall  come  into  force  on  such  date,  as  the  Central  Government  may,  by
notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. 

2.

In  article  164  of  the  Constitution,  for  clause (1), the following  shall  be substituted,
namely,-

Amendment  of 
Article 164. 

“(1)  The  Chief  Minister  shall  be  appointed  by  the  Governor  and  the  other 
Ministers  shall  be  appointed  by  the  Governor  on  the  advice  of  the  Chief 
Minister,  and  the  Ministers  shall  hold  office  till  such  time  they  enjoy  the 
confidence of the Legislative Assembly of the State.”

10 

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The concept that the Queen reigns, but the Ministers rule, is the bedrock of the 
Westminster system. However, the adoption of colonial expressions that impregnates 
principles of constitutional monarchy into a republican Constitution can result in the 
said expressions being interpreted against the spirit of the Constitution. The concept 
of  “serving during the pleasure” is archaic and a modern Constitution demands that 
such vestiges of colonial rule be dropped to strengthen its republican nature. 

Accordingly,  the  Bill  seeks  to  amend  clause  (1)  of  article  164  of  the 
Constitution pertaining to the appointment and term of the Council of Ministers in a 
State by providing that they shall hold office till such time they enjoy the confidence 
of  the  Legislative  Assembly  of  the  State  instead  of  ‘during  the  pleasure  of  the 
Governor’,  as  provided  at  present.  This  amendment  will  do  awaywith  the  present 
archaic  phraseology  and  bring  it  in  consonance  with  the  constitutional  form  of 
Government.   

Hence this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The  General  Clauses  Act,  1897  (Act  No.  10  of  1897)  has  been  a 
cornerstone  of  our  legal  framework,  providing  a  foundation  for  the 
interpretation and application of statutes promulgated in the country.  It is 
the  Interpretation  Act  of  India  and  has  often  been  called  the  "Law  of  all 
laws". The General Clauses Act, 1897 has been expressly made applicable 
for the interpretation of the Constitution as well by virtue of clause  (1) of 
article 367. It makes provisions as to the construction of General Acts and 
other laws of all-India application. The Supreme Court had pointed out in 
the Chief Inspector of Mines and Anr. v. Lala Karam Chand Thapar, Etc 
(1961) that the purpose of the General Clauses Act is to place in one single 
statute different provisions pertaining to interpretations of words and legal 
principles which would otherwise have to be specified separately in many 
different  acts  and  regulations.  Whatever  the  General  Clauses  Act  says, 
whether  as  regards  the  meanings  of  words  or  as  regards  legal  principles, 
has to be read into every statute to which it applies. 

Sub-section (1) of section 13 of the Act provides that, in all Central 
Acts and Regulations, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or 
context,  words  importing  the  masculine  gender  shall  be  taken  to  include 
longer  aligns 
females.  However, 
harmoniously with our present-day comprehension of gender and justice. It 
has  become  imperative  for  our  legal  structure  to  evolve  in  tandem  with 
societal  progress,  ensuring  that  it  is  all-encompassing  and  just  for  all  its 
citizens.

this  narrow 

It  must  be  noted  that  queerness  is  a  natural  phenomenon  which  is 
known  to  India  since  ancient  times.  In  fact,  historically,  Hijra  or 
transgender  persons  had  played  a  prominent  role  in  Indian  society. 
However, with the onset of colonial rule, the situation changed drastically, 
and since then, the transgender community in India has been marginalized 
and discriminated against, socially, economically and politically. 

The  Supreme  Court,  in  its  judgment  dated  15th  April,  2014  in 
National  Legal  Services  Authority  Vs.  Union  of  India  and  Ors., 
unequivocally  pronounced  that  the  State  is  obliged  to  acknowledge 
individuals  who  exist  beyond 
traditional  male-female  binary, 
the 
designating them as 'third gender persons,' and affirming their entitlement 
to all constitutionally guaranteed rights. The directive further called upon 
the  Union  and  State  Governments  to  confer  legal  recognition  upon  the 
self-identified gender of transgender persons. While the dictum laid down 
by the Apex court represented a significant stride forward, there remains a 
compelling imperative for a comprehensive legal recognition with the aim 
of empowering the transgender community. 

The  landmark  judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  2018  in  Navtej 
Singh Johar & Ors. v. Union of India played a pivotal role in safeguarding 
the rights of the LGBTQ community. This seminal judicial pronouncement 
resulted  in  the  decriminalization  of  consensual  homosexual  acts  among 
adults  and  a  resolute  affirmation  of  the  dignity  and  rights  of  LGBTQ 
individuals. The Supreme Court, in essence, ruled that LGBTQ individuals 
are  to  be  recognized  as  equal  citizens,  underlining  that  any  form  of 
discrimination rooted in sexual orientation or gender is impermissible and 
in  violation  of  the  law  and  the  fundamental  rights  enshrined  in  the 
Constitution. 

While  the  Parliament  subsequently  enacted  the  Transgender 
Persons  (Protection  of  Rights)  Act,  2019,  to  protect  the  rights  of  the 
transgender community and provide welfare measures for their betterment, 

3 

this  community  continue 

the  members  of 
to  confront  various 
manifestations  of  violence,  oppression,  contempt,  and  ridicule  on  a  daily 
basis.  They  continue  to  face  economic,  social  and  political  oppression  in 
both visible and invisible ways. 

In  Supriyo  @  Supriya  Chakraborty  &  Anr.  v.  Union  of  India 
(2023),  while  examining  the  question  of  incorporating  gender-neutral 
provisions  within  the  Special  Marriage  Act,  1954,  the  Supreme  Court, 
while  adhering  to  the  doctrine  of  separation  of  powers,  observed  against 
judicial legislations and placed the responsibility on the Parliament to fill 
the vacuum in due course of time vis-à-vis the transgender community. 

Including  the  transgender  community  in  the  General  Clauses  Act 
would ensure that they are not discriminated against while interpreting or 
applying any laws enacted in the country. It would be a significant as well 
as  a  symbolic  step  towards  recognizing  their  rights  and  promoting 
inclusivity.  In  light  of  the  observations  of  the  Supreme  Court  and 
international  human  rights  norms,  Parliament  has  a  unique  responsibility 
to  affirm  the  rights  of  every  individual,  regardless  of  their  sexual 
orientation,  gender  identity,  or  expression.  In  a  democratic  and  diverse 
nation like India, fostering inclusivity and non-discrimination is not just a 
legal  responsibility  but  a  moral  and  ethical 
imperative  as  well. 
Recognizing the rights of transgender persons within the General Clauses 
Act,  1897,  is  thus  a  pivotal  step  toward  dismantling  the  societal  barriers 
and stigma that have hindered their full participation in all aspects of life. 

As such, by addressing this matter, a powerful message can be sent 
that  India  stands  firmly  on  the  side  of  equality  and  justice  for  all  its 
citizens.  Ultimately,  passage  of  this  legislation  would  be  a  vital  step 
towards  fulfilling  the  promise  of  a  just  and  compassionate  society  where 
social justice prevails. 

Hence, this Bill.

   STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

the  period  of  emergency, 

Education is a field which our founding fathers were resolute 
to  keep  under  the  domain  of  the  States,  as  evident  from  its  placement 
Entry  11  of  the  State  List  under  the  Seventh  Schedule  of  the 
Constitution.  However,  during 
the 
Constitution  (Forty-second  Amendment)  Act  of  1976  altered  this 
paradigm  by  transposing  Education  from  the  State  List  to  the 
Concurrent List as Entry 25. This pivotal shift significantly curtailed the 
autonomy  of  States  in  overseeing  their  educational  institutions  and 
Universities,  ushering  in  an  era  where  the  Union  Government  and  its 
instrumentalities  wielded  control  over  this  vital  sphere  of  governance. 
Compounding these challenges, recent decisions of the Supreme  Court 
in  cases  such  as  Gambhirdan  K.  Gadhvi  vs.  State  of  Gujarat  &  Ors. 
[(2022) 5 SCC 179],  State of West Bengal Vs. Anindya Sundar Das  & 
Ors. [2022 SCC Online SC 1382], Professor  (Dr.) Sreejith P.S. vs. Dr. 
Rajasree  M.S.  &  Ors.  [2022  SCC  Online  SC  1473],  and  others, 
concerning  the  precedence  of  UGC  Regulations  over  State  laws,  have 
ignited  fervent  debates  on  the  constitutional  interpretation  of  the 
relationship  between  Central  Regulations  vis-à-vis  State  laws.  At  the 
heart  of 
subordinate 
legislation/delegated  legislation,  a  progeny  of  executive  fiat,  which 
refers  to  Rules,  Regulations,  or  Orders  promulgated  by  executive 
authorities  under  the  powers  conferred  upon  them  by  an  Act  of 
Parliament or State Legislature.

2.
In  Gambhirdan  K.  Gadhvi  vs.  State  of  Gujarat  &  Ors.  and
subsequent  cases,  the  Supreme  Court  deliberated  on  whether  the
Regulations issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) under
the  University  Grants  Commission  Act,  1956  [Act  No.  3  of  1956]
{hereinafter  referred  to  as  “UGC  Act”},  representing  a  quintessential
example  of  subordinate  legislation,  could  supersede  laws  enacted  by
State  Legislatures,  based  on  the  doctrine  of  repugnancy  under  Article
254  of  the  Indian  Constitution.  The  Apex  Court,  accorded  primacy  to
UGC  Regulations,  contending  that  they  formed  an  integral  part  of  the
UGC  Act  as  a  subordinate  legislation,  thus  prevailing  over  conflicting
State  laws.  The  Supreme  Court  reasoned  that  since  UGC  Regulations
and Rules are to be laid before each House of Parliament as per section
28  of  the  UGC  Act,  the  UGC  Regulations  assume  statutory  force  and
becomes inseparable from the parent Act. However, granting primacy to
delegated legislation over State enactments not only impinges upon the
federal tapestry woven by the framers of our constitution but also raises
profound  questions 
legitimacy  and
ramifications  on  the  constitutional  framework  governing  legislative
relations between the Union and States. Furthermore, this judgement of
the  Apex  Court  effectively  diminishes  the  concurrent  legislative
authority  granted  to  the  States  by  the  Constitution  in  the  realm  of
education.  Therefore,  a  nuanced  understanding  of  constitutional
principles and a re-consideration of the role of subordinate legislation in
the  hierarchy  of  laws  are  imperative  to  safeguard  the  federal  structure
and democratic ethos enshrined in the Constitution.

entanglement.  Article  254  delineates  a  delicate  equipoise  between
Parliamentary enactments, pre-constitutional subordinate legislation and
State  legislations,  save  for  exceptions  carved  out  under  Presidential
assent. Notably, the diligent omission of post-constitutional subordinate
legislations  from  this  interplay,  as  elaborately  explained  hereinafter,
underscores  need  to  safeguard  the  sovereignty  of  State  laws  against
encroachment by central executive mandates.

examination  of  Article  254  evinces  that 
inconsistency  between 
those
promulgated  by  State  Legislatures,  the  laws  made  by  Parliament  shall
prevail  unless  the  conflicting  State  legislation  receives  the  President's
assent.  As  such,  it  shows  that  the  concept  of  repugnancy  under  this
Article  pertains  specifically  to  conflicts  between  State  laws  and
substantive laws passed by Parliament, thereby excluding considerations
of Rules, Regulations, and the like. Furthermore, Article 254 is housed
within  Part  XI,  Chapter  I  of  the  Constitution,  which  enunciates
'Legislative Relations between the Union and the States‟. This Chapter
is  distinctly  concerned  with  delineating  the  distribution  of  legislative
powers  between  State  legislatures  and  Parliament,  and  not  with  Union
Executive, contrasting with Chapter II, which addresses 'Administrative
Relations'  encompassing  relationships  between  the  Union  and  State
Executives.

In addition to the primary principle outlined in  Article 254,
5.
as  elucidated  above,  clause  (1)  of  Article  254  establishes  that  if  any
provision  of  a  law  enacted  by  a  State  Legislature  conflicts  with  a
provision  of  an  "existing  law"  concerning  matters  enumerated  in  the
Concurrent  List,  the  "existing  law"  shall  take  precedence.  This
underscores  the  critical  distinction  between  the  terms  "law"  and
"existing law" within the purview of Article 254, as the Article employs
them  distinctly  to  delineate  different  scenarios.  Thus,  it  becomes
imperative  to  comprehend  the  nuances  and  scope  of  these  terms  for  a
comprehensive interpretation of Article 254.

6.
Within the Constitution's definition clause (Article 366), the
term  "Law"  lacks  a  specific  definition  that  extends  its  scope  to
encompass  subordinate  legislations  such  as  Rules  or  Regulations.  The
sole provision in the Constitution permitting the inclusion of Rules and
Regulations  within  the  ambit  of  "Laws"  is  Article  13(3)(a)  in  Part  III.
However,  this  provision  is  confined  to  the  context  of  determining  the
validity  of  laws  inconsistent  with  or  derogatory  to  fundamental  rights
and  is  not  applicable  to  other  parts  of  the  Constitution.  Consequently,
the  significance  of  the  term  "existing  laws"  becomes  paramount,  as
evidenced by the Constitution framers' decision to differentiate between
"Laws"  and  "existing  laws"  within  the  same  Article.  In  this  regard,
clause 10 of Article 366 is reproduced hereunder;

366. Definitions.—In  this  Constitution,  unless  the  context
otherwise requires, the following expressions have the meanings 
hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say— 

.............................................................................. 

4 

(10) “existing law” means any law, Ordinance, order,  bye-
the 
law,  rule  or  regulation  passed  or  made  before 
commencement  of 
this  Constitution  by  any  Legislature, 
authority  or  person  having  power  to  make  such  a  law, 
Ordinance,  order,  bye-law,  rule  or  regulation;  (Emphasis 
supplied) 

Therefore, Article 366(10) allows for a narrow interpretation 
of  Article  254,  accommodating  only  those  Rules  and  Regulations 
promulgated „before the Constitution's commencement‟ under the term 
"existing  law".  Thus,  the  framers  of  the  Constitution  deliberately 
employed  both  "Laws"  and  "Existing  Laws"  within  the  same  Article 
254  to  unequivocally  convey  their  intent  that  no  form  of  subordinate 
legislation  by  the  Central  Government  or  its  instrumentalities  should 
render State laws subservient, except for those subordinate  legislations 
promulgated  prior  to  the  Constitution's  commencement,  which  came 
into force on 26thJanuary, 1950. This meticulous delineation within the 
Constitution,  reserving  a  niche  for  pre-constitutional  subordinate 
legislations  under  the  rubric  of  "existing  law”,  underscores  the 
Constitution  makers'  commitment  to  preserving  the  principles  of  co-
operative  federalism  while  ensuring  administrative  continuity  by 
safeguarding  pre-constitutional 
subordinate 
legislations.

7.
The intention of our founding fathers is unmistakably clear,
leaving  no  room  for  ambiguity,  as  they  meticulously  distinguished
between 
subordinate
legislations, granting explicit authority for the former to supersede State
laws  while denying such permission  for the latter. This is underscored
by  the  specific  meaning  attributed  to  the  term  "existing  law"  in  clause
(10) of  Article  366.  This  differentiation,  permitting  pre-constitutional
transitional  provision,  finds  further
subordinate 
reinforcement  in  the  language  of  clause  (2)  of  Article  254.  Here,  the
distinct  terms  "earlier  law  made  by  Parliament"  and  "existing  law"
within  the  same  sentence  serve  to  emphasize  this  differentiation  once
more.

9.
Remarkably,  this  pivotal  aspect  outlined  in  Article  254  in
conjunction with Article 366(10) seems to have been overlooked in the
judgments supra. By equating subordinate legislation with central laws
without delving into the scope of the term "existing laws" in Article 254
r/w  Article  366(10),  it  appears  that  the  Courts  have  inadvertently
expanded the scope of Article 254 beyond its intended purview. None of
the mentioned judgments have addressed the crucial aspect of "existing
law"  in  Article  254,  which  proscribe  the  precedence  of  subordinate
legislations  passed  after  the  Constitution's  commencement  over  State
laws.

5 

10.
The  doctrine  of  repugnancy  enshrined  in  Article  254
presupposes  a  delicate  equilibrium  of  legislative  powers  among  the
Parliament  and  State  Legislatures,  with  each  possessing  exclusive
authority  over  certain  subjects.  Allowing  post-constitutional  delegated
legislation  to  override  State  laws  not  only  contradicts  the  Constitution
itself but may also disrupt this balance, potentially encroaching upon the
autonomy of States in legislative matters.

11.
Moreover,  treating  central  subordinate  legislation  on  par
with  Central  Laws  confers  significant  authority  upon  the  Union
Government and its instrumentalities to establish any kind of rules and
regulations without undergoing thorough legislative scrutiny.   Reliance
by  Courts  on  Section  28  of  the  UGC  Act  to  subjugate  State  laws  to
UGC Regulations neglects the schism between legislative and delegated
powers.  While  State  laws  are  crafted  by  elected  representatives,
delegated  legislation  originates  from  executive  bodies.  Delegated
legislation,  by  its  nature,  lacks  the  democratic  participation,  scrutiny,
and consideration of regional interests and deliberation associated with
legislative  enactments,  warranting  a  more  circumspect  approach  to  its
legal  status.  The  will  of  a 
the  elected
representatives  shouldn‟t  be  made  subservient  to  delegated  laws
promulgated  by  Executive.  An  interpretation  to  the  contrary  also
disregards  the  significance  of  Article  254(2),  an  exception  to  the
doctrine  of  repugnancy,  which  allows  State  laws,  even  if  conflicting
with  central  laws,  to  supersede  them  with  the  President's  assent.  As
previously  discussed,  the  above  referred  judgments  also  effectively
undermine the concurrent legislative authority  granted to the  States by
the Constitution in the realm of education.

legislature  comprising 

12.
Furthermore,  the  Supreme  Court's  approach  to  interpreting
Article  254  in  the  context  of  conflicts  between  central  regulations  and
state  laws  seems  to  be  inconsist.  While  delivering  judgments  in
Gambhirdan  K.  Gadhvi  vs.  State  of  Gujarat  &  Ors.  and  subsequent
cases,  the  Supreme  Court  overlooked  its  own  precedent  established  in
Kalyani  Mathivanan  vs.  K.V.  Jeyaraj  &  Ors.  [(2015)  6  SCC  363],
wherein  it  was  ruled  that  UGC  Regulations  are  not  binding  unless
adopted  by  the  State  Government.  While  paragraph  3.7  of  the
Gambhirdan  K.  Gadhvi  judgment  made  a  mention  of  the  Kalyani
Mathivanan  decision,  it  failed  to  engage  in  any  discussion  or  offer
reasons for departing from the precedent set by the latter. This omission
led  to  conflicting  conclusions  on  the  same  subject  matter,  thereby
creating inconsistency regarding the hierarchy of laws and regulations.

13.
In conclusion, the judicial interpretations in Gambhirdan and
subsequent  cases  regarding  the  UGC  Regulations  have  veered  off  the
constitutional  trajectory,  highlighting  a  significant  chasm  between
constitutional intent and judicial interpretation. Given these intricacies,
there is a pressing need for recalibration of this jurisprudence to realign
with  the  true  essence  of  Article  254  and  to  safeguard  the  federal
principles  and  democratic  values  enshrined  in  the  Indian  Constitution.
Therefore,  legislative  clarity  through  amendment  to  the  UGC  Act  is
essential  to  ensure  consistency  and  coherence  with  constitutional
principles  in  resolving  conflicts  between  UGC  Regulations  and  State
laws, upholding the paramountcy of the Constitution.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

 The Indian Penal Code, 1860 has been replaced by the Bharatiya 
Nyaya  Sanhita,  2023  (BNS).  The  main  ground  of  the  Government  to 
replace  the  Code  was  that  the  existing  criminal  law  reflected  colonial 
outlook and to get rid of the colonial past, a new law is required. There is 
no  doubt  that  colonial  moral  imprints  were  clearly  visible  in  the 
provisions  that  criminalized  homosexuality,  adultery,  enticing  married 
women and even marital rape exemption in the Indian Penal Code (IPC). 
However, it seems that the Government failed to grab the opportunity to 
truly decolonise the law. 

2. While the BNS has dropped the provisions on criminalizing adultery
(Section  497  IPC),  thus  giving  effect  to  the  Supreme  Court  decision  in
Joseph  Shine  v.  Union  of  India  (2019),  it  continues  to  retain  the
provisions on enticing a married woman (Section 83) and the marital rape
exemption  (Section  63,  Exception  2).  Section  498  of  the  repealed  IPC
criminalized enticing or taking away a married woman with the intention
of sexual intercourse. Since, women were perceived as a property of their
husbands, any form of sexual transgression with a wife is considered an
infringement of the husband's proprietary right over her. The section was
designed  to protect  the  right of  the  husband  and not  the  wife.  Similar  is
the  case  of  retention  of  marital  rape  exemption  from  the  IPC  in  BNS,
based  on  the  belief  that  husbands  have  ownership  over  their  wives  post
marriage.  This  exemption  to  the  offence  of  rape  grants  immunity  to  the
husband to have non-consensual sexual intercourse with their wives. This
is even when marital rape has been recognized as cruelty and a ground for
divorce. All of this is at the cost of women's dignity, bodily integrity and
her  right  to  sexual  autonomy.  Therefore,  these  provisions  should  be
deleted from the BNS.

Further  in  Rangaraju  and  Vajapeyi  Vs.  State  of  Karnataka,  the
3.
Karnataka High Court has observed that the act of sexual harassment or
assault on a dead body does not come under any of the provisions of the
Indian  Penal  Code  (IPC).  The  Court  has  recommended  that  the  IPC
should  be  amended  to  make  necrophilia,  i.e.,  sexual  attraction  or  act
involving a person engaging in sexual activities with a deceased body, an
offence. The Division Bench passed the order acquitting the accused from
the charges of raping a 25 year old woman after murdering her.

Necrophilia is a paraphilia in which the perpetrator derives pleasure
4.
from a heinous crime such as having sex with dead bodies. Necrophilia is
a  "psychosexual  disorder"  identified  as  a  "paraphilia"  by  the  DSM-IV
(Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders)  which  includes
pedophilia, exhibitionism and sexual mutilation.

5.
Even in the new Nyaya Sanhita, a dead person does have right and
dignity. Section 315 of the BNS recognizes dishonest misappropriation of
the  dead  man's  property,  as  an  offence.  Further,  section  351  of  BNS,
which deals with defamation, stipulates that libel or slander against a dead

2 

person also constitutes the offence of criminal defamation. Section 356 of 
the same law, which defines criminal intimidation, includes threatening a 
person  with  injuring  the  reputation  of  a  dead  person  dear  to  him,  as  an 
offence.  Section  301,  deals  with  the  offence  of  trespassing  on  burial 
grounds etc., states that if any person offers any indignity to any human 
corpse,  or  causes  disturbance 
the 
performance of funeral ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment 
of  either  description for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  two  years,  or  with 
fine, or with both. 

to  any  person  assembled  for 

6.
The Supreme Court in its various judgements has held that the right
to  dignity  prevails  even  after  death.  In  S.  Sethu  Raja  Vs.  The  Chief
Secretary (W.P. (MI) No. 3888 of 2007), the petitioner had brought to the
court's  attention,  the  Supreme  Court's  stand  on  right  to  accord  decent
burial  or  cremation  to  a  dead  body.  The  Supreme  Court's  stand  be
interpreted  from  its  decision  in  Ram  Sharan  Autyanuprasi  Vs.  Union  of
India (AIR 1989 Supreme Court 549) in which it held thus,

"13... It is true that the life in its expanded horizons today includes all 
that  give  meaning  to  a  man's  life  including  his  tradition,  culture  and 
heritage  and  protection  of  that  heritage  in  its  full  measure  would 
certainly come within the encompass of an expanded concept of Art. 
21 of the Constitution." 

Further  the  Apex  Court  in  Pt.  Parmanand  Katara  Vs.  Union  of  India 
(1995 (3) SCC 248) had observed thus, 

"the word and expression "person in article 21, would include a dead 
person in a limited sense and that his rights to his life which includes 
his right to live with human dignity, to have an extended meaning to 
treat his dead body with respect, which he would have deserved, had 
they been alive subject to his tradition, culture and the religion, which 
he professed. The State must respect a dead by allowing the body of 
that dead person to be treated with ignity and unless it is required for 
the  purposes  of  establishing  a  crime,  to  ascertain  the  cause  of  death 
and  the  subjected  to  post-mortem  or  for  any  scientific  investigation, 
medical education or to save life of another person in accordance with 
the  law,  the  preservation  of  the  dead  body  and  its  disposal  in 
accordance with human dignity" 

In  Ashray  Adhikar  Abhiyan  Vs.  Union  of  India  (AIR  2002  SC  554)  the 
Supreme  Court  had  upheld  the  right  of  a  homeless  deceased  to  have  a 
decent burial as per their religious belief and the corresponding obligation 
of the State towards such people. 

7.
Many countries in the world have laws on necrophilia. In the UK,
any  kind  of  sexual  harassment  or  inappropriate  physical  conduct  with  a
dead body is against the law, and conviction in this case can lead to a jail
term of six months to two years or a fine. Legislation against necrophilia
also exists in Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. In Canada, without
using the word necrophilia, it is mentioned that maximum sentence of 5
years  can  be  cited  for  harming  the  dignity  and  rights  of  a  dead  body.

3 

At  the  same  time,  in  New  Zealand,  a  provision  has  been  made  for  a 
maximum punishment of 2 years regarding this law. 

It  is  therefore  the  need  of  the  society  that  a  law  for  providing
8.
punishment  for  necrophilia  should  be  made  by  creating  a  new  offence
under BNS.

The Bills seeks to achieve the above said objectives.

    STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

India is the second largest silk producer and the largest consumer in the world. 
The  demand  of  silk  goods,  particularly  silk  sarees,  is  so  high  that  India  needs  to 
import  large  quantity  of  raw  silk  to  meet  the  domestic  demand.  The  major  silk-
producing states in the country are Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Jammu & 
Kashmir,  Karnataka,  Chhattisgarh,  Maharashtra,  Tamil  Nadu,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and 
West  Bengal. The country’s sericulture industry employs around 9.2 million people 
in  rural  and  semi-urban  areas  (as  per  year  2022-23)  for  raw  silk  cultivation, 
production of silk goods and marketing activities. The industry is one of the largest 
foreign exchange earners in the country with exports to more than 30 countries in the 
world. The sericulture activities in India are spread across 52,360 villages. 

2.
As  far  as  woven  silk  products  are  concerned,  there  are  two  major  categories:
hand-woven  silk  products  and  power  loom  silk  products.  Handloom  products  are
woven  by  hand  on  simple  machine  loom  and  power  loom  sarees  by  machine,
powered with the electric motor. Handloom is a dying skill, rapidly being replaced by
power loom as it produces fast and at cheaper rates.

3.
The handloom silk industry run by traditional weavers is facing many challenges
in  different  ways  including  price  fluctuation  of  raw  silk,  and  competition  from
synthetic fibers. The conditions of traditional silk weavers in the country are pathetic
and they are facing a lot of difficulties in keeping the heritage alive.

4. A case in point is the weavers of Bhagalpur, Bihar, once called the Silk City of
Bihar.  Five years back, there used to be around two lakh weavers in Bhagalpur, but
now  only  60,000  weavers  are  there  and  the  business  from  the  place  has  also  come
down  from  Rs.  600  crore  in  2015  to  Rs.  150  crore  at  present.  Bhagalpur  silk  is  a
renowned  product  in  the  world  and  has  got  the  Government’s  Geographical
Indication tag, in view of its quality and distinctiveness. Around 1000 weavers of the
place have GI certificates.  Bhagalpur Silk Sarees boast a rich heritage that dates back
to  centuries.  Crafted  by  skilled  artisans  using  traditional  techniques  passed  down
through generations, the sarees embody the cultural essence of the region.  The art of
weaving  Bhagalpur  Silk  is  deeply  ingrained  in  the  local  community  with  weavers
meticulously creating each saree with passion and expertise.  Earlier, the core process
of  extracting  the  filaments  from  cocoons  to  preparing  yarn,  used  to  take  place  in
Bhagalpur,  but  now  the  yarn  is  being  procured  from  other  cities  like  Surat,
Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Kolkata, which sometimes gets mixed with silk imported
from China and Korea.  In view of the reducing demand of handloom sarees and the
rising  cost  of  the  yarn,  the  silk  industry  of  Bhagalpur  is  dying.    The  traditional
weavers who have worked for generations are leaving the city or are opting for some
other  occupation  for  their  livelihood  as  there  is  no  business.  These  weavers  need
incentives and subsidies, uninterrupted power supply, continuous work, and housing
facilities.

5.
In the same way, there are millions of traditional handloom silk weavers spread
across  various  parts  of  our  country.  On  the  one  hand,  silk  export  is  increasing,
earning huge foreign exchange and on the other hand, the handloom silk weavers and
their families live in abject poverty nearly hand to mouth. There are many problems
experienced  by  traditional  handloom  silk  weavers,  including  limited  facilities,  and
extreme  competition  from  power  looms,  fluctuating  cost  of  raw  material,  etc.  For
most  of  the  traditional  handloom  silk  weavers,  it  is  their  family  profession,  which

6 

passes on from one generation to other and their entire families are involved in this 
profession. For them, weaving is the only source of their livelihood and prosperity. It 
is  important  to  stand  for  these  people  and  value  their  art,  tradition,  time,  skill  and 
effort that goes into making these exquisite handloom sarees and other products. 

6. Since the poor handloom silk weavers are part and parcel of our society and ours
being a welfare State, it is necessary that the handloom silk weavers too are provided
with  adequate  insurance  cover  against  accidents,  healthcare,  financial  assistance  in
case of need, educational, vocational facilities for their children, etc. Urgent remedial
measures have to be taken for the welfare and protection of traditional handloom silk
weavers.  It  has,  therefore,  been  proposed  through  this  Bill  to  establish  the  National
Traditional  Handloom  Silk  Weavers  Welfare  Council  and  also  the  Traditional
Handloom  Silk  Weavers  Welfare  Fund  to  improve  the  plight  of  the  traditional
handloom silk weavers and save them from starvation in various parts of our nation.

    Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

         Clause  4  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  constitute  the  National  Traditional  Handloom  Silk 
Weavers Welfare Council along with a secretariat with such number of officers and staff 
to aid the efficient functioning of the Council. Clause 5 provides for certain steps to be 
taken  by  the  Council  for  ensuring  the  welfare  of  traditional  handloom  silk  weavers. 
Clause  6  provides  for  the  constitution  of  the  Traditional  Handloom  Silk  Weavers 
Welfare Fund. Clause 7 provides that the Central Government shall provide Funds to the 
Council.  

      The Bill, therefore, if enacted, will involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund 
of India. It is estimated that a sum of Rupees five hundred crore is likely to be involved 
as recurring expenditure per annum. 

      A  non-recurring  expenditure  of  rupees  two  hundred  crore  is  also  likely  to  be 
incurred. 

8 

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 9 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make provisions through 
an order to remove any difficulties likely to arise in giving effect to the provisions of the 
Bill, if enacted. Clause 11 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules for 
carrying out the purposes of the Bill.  

As  the  orders  and  rules  will  relate  to  matters  of  detail  only,  the  delegation  of 

legislative power is of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The  Constitution  of  India  works  on  the  principles  of  checks  and  balances 
amongst  various  organs  of  the  State.  The  Executive  is  accountable  to  the 
Legislature.    An  independent  Judiciary  keeps  a  check  on  the  Executive  and  the 
Legislature  as  per  the  principles  enshrined  in  the  Constitution.    The  Election 
Commission,  Public  Service  Commission,  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General 
(CAG)  are  required  to  perform  their  constitutional  duties  without  any  fear  and 
favour, and devoid of any interference from the Government.  The independence of 
these institutions is ensured through fixed tenure, financial independence, stringent 
removal procedure and restrictions after demitting the office. As per article 124, a 
Judge of the Supreme Court after ceasing to hold office cannot appear as a lawyer 
before any court or authority in India. Article 220 provides similar restrictions on a 
Judge  of  a  High  Court  except  for  appearance  before  the  Supreme  Court  or  other 
High  Courts.    The  CAG  and  the  Chairman/Members  of  the  Public  Service 
Commission  cannot  take  up  any  other  employment  with  Central  or  State 
Governments  after  demitting  office.    These  restrictions  are  laid  down  to  avoid 
favouritism, during the period of holding such positions, towards the Government 
in power with the intent of securing any post-retirement benefits. However, there 
are  no  such  restrictions  for  the  Judges  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  High  Courts 
regarding any other office after retirement.  

Further there are no such restrictions on any of them when it comes to joining 
political  parties,  contesting  elections  or  being  nominated  to  certain  posts.    There 
are  notable  instances  of  persons  who  held  independent  constitutional  posts  and 
later went on to join politics or were nominated to various posts. There have been 
two  Supreme  Court  Judges  in  1967  and  1983,  who  resigned  from  their  posts  to 
contest  the  presidential  and  parliamentary  elections  respectively.    Another 
Supreme  Court  Judge  joined  a  political  party  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  contested 
elections  five  years  after  his  retirement  in  1999.    A  former  Chief  Election 
Commissioner  became  a  Rajya  Sabha  Member  and  Minister  in  2004.    A  retired 
Chief  Justice  of  India  was  nominated  to  the  Rajya  Sabha  in  2020  within  four 
months  of  his  retirement.  Recently  a  High  Court  Judge  joined  a  political  party 
immediately  after  taking  premature  retirement.    There  have  also  been  occasions 
where retired CAG and Judges have been appointed as Governors of States.   

Bureaucrats are also not far behind in appointment to constitutional posts or 
joining  political  parties.  Numerous  bureaucrats  have  joined  political  parties  and 
contested elections after resigning from service or soon after their retirement. The 
Election  Commission  had  in  2012  recommended  to  the  Union  Government  to 
provide  for  a  cooling-off  period  for  top  bureaucrats  after  their  retirement  before 
they could join political parties and contest elections but the Government rejected 
that  recommendation.  The  Supreme  Court  had  also  dismissed  a  writ  petition  in 
May, 2022 that sought a direction from the apex Court to the Legislature to frame a 
law  imposing  a  cooling-off  period  for  retired  bureaucrats  before  joining  politics. 
The Court observed that it is for the Legislature to determine whether a cooling-off 
period is required for bureaucrats before they join politics after retirement. There 
are rules at present which restrict a senior bureaucrat from joining a private job for 
at least one year after he or she retires from Government service. But there is no 
restriction on appointment to constitutional posts or on joining political parties.  

The  famous  judicial  quote  that  ‘justice  should  not  only  be  done  but  should 
also be seen to be done’ must be adhered to under all circumstances.  This applies 
equally to Judges, independent constitutional authorities and senior bureaucrats.  It 
is an indispensable trait while discharging their official functions.  Extending this 
principle to the period even after they demit office will have a salutary effect. A 
member of the Constituent Assembly, Shri K.T. Shah, had suggested that Judges 
of  constitutional  courts  should  be  legally  barred from  occupying  executive posts. 
But  the  Constituent  Assembly  did  not  find  favour  with  this.  Former  Union  Law 

3 

Minister  had  once  advocated  a  cooling-off  period  for  Judges  saying  “pre-
retirement judgments are influenced by a desire for a post-retirement job”.  

 It is therefore proposed to have a cooling-off period of three years for joining 
political  parties  or  being  nominated  to  political  posts  by  the  Government  for 
bureaucrats.  For  Judges  and  other  independent  constitutional  authorities,  it  is 
proposed  that  there  should  be  a  total  ban  on  any  further  appointments  except  as 
required by law passed by the appropriate legislature. This will instill confidence 
in the public at large and negate any allegations of quid pro quo. 

Hence, this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

India  has  the  one  of  youngest  population  as  of  now.  But  the  number  of  old  age 
people are increasing each year with the lowering of birth rate and death rate. Increased life 
expectancy  of  the  citizens  will  translate  into  a  more  aged  population.    Further,  with  an 
increase in the proportion of the younger generation migrating to other cities or countries 
in search of livelihood and career avenues, aged parents and relatives are often left isolated 
in their home towns with no one to take care of them in their old age and sickness.  

Necessary  steps  need  to  be  taken  urgently  to  see  that  the  problem  is  addressed 
properly. Senior citizens need help in terms of old age care and resources and information. 

The Central Government shall take it up as its statutory responsibility backed by 

sound legislation to ensure right to old age care to all senior citizens of India. 

The Bill seeks to achieve this objective. 

V. SIVADASAN

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

Sub-clause  (2)  of  Clause  3  of  the  Bill  provides  that  no  senior  citizen  shall  be 
denied old age care on account of their lack of income or other circumstances. Clause 4 
provides  that  the  appropriate  Government  shall  take  special  measures  to  address  the 
special needs of and provide special facilities to the differently-abled senior citizens.  

Clause  6  provides  that  the  Central  Government  shall  have  the  primary 
responsibility  for  providing  funds  for  the  purpose  of  implementation  of  the  Act  and 
shall provide funds to the State Governments, to meet such percentage of expenditure, 
as  may  be  prescribed,  as  grants-in-aid  of  revenues,  to  enable  them  to  carry  out  the 
purposes of this Bill.  

Clause 7 provides that it shall be the duty of the appropriate Government or the 
local authority, as the case may be, to notify or establish, a well-equipped old age care 
centre, within  such  area  or  limits  of  neighbourhood,  as  may  be  prescribed  and  also 
provide  infrastructure including building, equipments and well-trained staff.  

The Bill, therefore, if enacted will involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund 
of India. It is, however, not possible at this stage to estimate the expenditure involved. 

5 

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 8 of the Bill empowers the appropriate Government to make rules for carrying 
out the purposes of the Bill. As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, the delegation 
of legislative power is of a normal character.

clause shall be read as "not less than five years" in place of "not less than eleven 
years".” 

10 

2 

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

     The Citizenship Act, 1955 (57 of 1955) was enacted to provide for the acquisition and 
determination  of  Indian  citizenship.  It  is  a  historical  fact  that  trans-border  migration  of 
population  has  been  happening  continuously  between  the  territories  of  India  and  the 
neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri 
Lanka.  Many  people  belonging  to  different  religious  and  ethnic  groups  face  religious 
persecution and torture in these countries. This includes non-religious persons and atheists 
as well. Many such persons have fled to India to seek shelter and continued to stay in India 
even without complete travel documents or after expiry of the validity of such documents. 
They are then treated as illegal migrants.   

    Therefore, the proposed Bill seeks to grant immunity to these victims of religious or 
racial persecution irrespective of their religion, caste and sect so that any proceeding against 
them on the basis of their status of migration or citizenship does not bar them from applying 
for Indian citizenship.  

 Hence, this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

According to reports from several international agencies, during the 
period from 1970 to 2019, natural hazards accounted for 50 per cent. of all 
disasters, 45 per cent. of all reported deaths and 74 per cent. of all reported 
economic losses. 

Globally, there were more than 11,000 reported disasters attributed 
to  these  hazards,  with  over  two  million  deaths  and  $3.64  trillion  in 
economic  losses.  More  than  91  per  cent.  of  these  deaths  occurred  in 
developing  countries.    Meanwhile,  economic  losses  have  increased 
sevenfold  globally, rising from an average of $49 million  in 1970s, to a 
staggering $383 million per day in 2010s. 

India as a country with a vast land area and high population density 
has found itself in the cusp of many natural disasters which take away the 
lives of hundreds of innocent people and result in huge economic losses.  

There  is  a  need  to  ensure  that  the  regions  which  are  particularly 
vulnerable to climate change-induced disasters are not left alone and are 
supported  by  the  nation  so  that  an  equitable  growth  and  development  is 
made  possible  for  all  areas  of  the  country.  States  which  are  repeatedly 
facing recurring natural disasters needs special assistance and attention, so 
that they do not lag behind in development.  

The Bill proposes to constitute a National Commission for Natural 
Disaster Affected Persons for protecting the interests and rights of persons 
affected by the impact of natural disasters arising due to climate change 
and other factors by constant monitoring of the increasing impact of climate 
change and make policy recommendations to the Central Government to 
mitigate its adverse effects on the vulnerable population. 

Hence, this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

Clause 4 provides for the constitution of the National Commission 
for Natural Disaster Affected Persons and the appointment of a Chairperson 
and Members therein as well as the salary and allowances payable to, and 
other terms and conditions of service of the Chairperson and Members of 
the  Commission.    Clause  5  lays  down  the  duties  and  functions  of  the 
Commission  including  the  study  and  identification  of  regions  which  are 
prone  to  natural  disasters  and  particularly  vulnerable  to  climate  change 
impacts and to constantly monitor the increasing impact of climate change 
and  submit  policy  recommendations  to  the  Central  Government  in  this 
regard.  Clause 6 provides for the establishment of a Secretariat to support 
the functioning of the Commission and the salary and allowances payable 
to and other terms and conditions of service of the officers and staff of the 
Commission.  Clause 7 of the Bill provides that the Central Government 
shall,  after  due  appropriation  made  by  Parliament  by  law  in  this  behalf, 
grant  such  sums  of  money  to  the  Commission,  as  it  may  think  fit,  for 
carrying out the purposes of this Act. 

The Bill, therefore, if enacted, would involve both non-recurring and 
recurring expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. However, at 
this juncture, it is difficult to estimate the actual expenditure likely to be 
involved.

  MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 13 of the Bill empowers the appropriate Government to make 
rules for carrying out the purposes of the Bill. As the rules will relate to 
matters of detail only, the delegation of legislative power is of a normal 
character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

People’s ability and freedom to use their native language is essential 
for human dignity and peaceful co-existence. Language is a systematic form 
of  communication.  It  facilitates  meaningful  interactions  with  one  another, 
enables cultural expressions in a variety of forms, as well as the transmission 
of  centuries-long  knowledge,  history,  world  views,  beliefs,  and  traditions. 
When  the  State  fails  to  guarantee  the  ‘right  to  use  one’s  own  language’,  it 
seriously  limits  the  boundaries  of  the  freedom  of  thought  and  expression 
enshrined  in  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  (1948)  and  the 
Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Indian Constitution. Hence, it is critical 
to  protect  and  preserve  all  the  languages  irrespective  of  the  number  of 
speakers.  Realising  the  alarming  rate  of  the  disappearance  of  indigenous 
languages at the global level, UNESCO has already declared the decade of 
2022-2032 as the International Decade of Indigenous Languages.  

An ‘endangered language’ is one that is likely to become extinct in 
the near future.  As per census 2011, more than 19,500 languages or dialects 
are spoken in India as mother tongues, while only 121 languages are spoken 
by 10,000 or more people. This shows the quantum of endangered languages 
in our country.  Many languages are falling out of use and are being replaced 
by others that are more widely used in the region. Unless current trends are 
reversed, these endangered languages will become extinct soon.  Many other 
languages are no longer being learned by new generations of children or by 
new adult speakers. Hence, these languages will become extinct when their 
last  speaker  dies.  In  fact,  dozens  of  languages  today  have  only  one  native 
speaker  still  living,  and  that  person's  death  will  mean  the  extinction  of  the 
language.  

According  to  the  Peoples  Linguistic  Survey  of  India,  India  has 
already  lost  250  languages  during  the  last  50  years.  Although  successive 
Governments  have  undertaken  many  programmes  at  the  national  and  state 
level to conserve the endangered languages, these efforts are not sufficient for 
protecting and preserving the vulnerable languages in the country.  There is 
an urgent need to understand the gravity of the problem at the national level 
and formulate a proactive action plan to preserve these endangered languages. 
Therefore, establishment of a National Commission for the Preservation of 
Endangered  Languages  is  perceived  as  the  most  effective  and  pragmatic 
policy initiative to revive, preserve and develop the endangered languages in 
the country. 

Hence, this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the National 
Commission for the Preservation of Endangered Languages and appointment 
of a Chairperson, Members, Member Secretary  to the Commission. Clause 4 
provides  for  the  appointment  of  officers  and  staff  and  experts  to  assist  the 
Commission in the efficient discharge of its functions.  Clause 5 provides that 
the Commission shall conduct in-depth research to suggest to the Government 
better  ways  of  ensuring  the  preservation  of  endangered  languages  in  the 
country as well as support the institutions, organisations and individuals who 
are engaged in the promotion and preservation of endangered languages in the 
country as part of its functions.  Clause 9 provides for the constitution of an 
Endangered Language Fund to which the Central and State Governments shall 
contribute in such ratio as may be prescribed. 

The Bill, therefore, if enacted, would involve both recurring and non-
recurring expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India.  However, at this 
juncture, it is difficult to estimate the actual expenditure likely to be involved.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 14 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

Artificial intelligence (AI) presents big opportunities and potential 
risks for the countries around the globe. The transformative effect of AI on 
commerce, government service delivery and human interactions can hardly 
be ignored in India as well. Realizing the future prospects and risks of AI, the 
NITI Aayog released two major documents in 2018 and 2021 – the National 
AI  Strategy  and  the  Principles  of  Responsible  AI.  Since  India  stands  at  a 
unique position to leverage such emerging technologies for dynamic growth, 
the  Government  has  taken  a  proactive  approach  toward  developing 
frameworks for ethical and responsible deployment of AI systems.  

Nevertheless, AI continues to develop rapidly with new tools being 
released on a regular basis capable of increasingly sophisticated tasks. The 
sophistication of these tools and their capabilities to generate highly realistic 
imagery has raised concerns over the long term social and political impact of 
AI. With the advent of deep learning and deep fake, world over Governments 
are  seeking  to  address  the  issues  of  regulating  AI.  These  digitally  falsified 
media have the potential to harm reputations, fabricate evidence, and erode 
trust  in  institutions  due  to  their  hyper-realistic  nature.  Besides,  the  AI  is 
replacing  human  labor  with  machines  at  a  faster  rate.  This  has  seriously 
affected the livelihood of large number of people.     

Against  this  context,  the  EU  and  Canada  had  already  initiated 
regulations  to  control  and  monitor  the use  of  AI.  But  India  currently  lacks 
specific  regulatory  mechanism  that  directly  addresses  generative  AI,  deep 
fakes, and AI-related crimes. While the existing guidelines list good practices 
and steer towards a vision for responsible AI, they are not legally binding. 
Therefore,  there  is  a  need  for  establishing  a  specific  authority  that  is 
empowered to regulate, monitor and control the use of AI in an ethical manner 
without  affecting  its  innovative  potentials.      The  rapid  advancement  and 
proliferation  of  AI  technologies  necessitate  the  establishment  of  a  robust 
regulatory framework to ensure the ethical, transparent, and accountable use 
of AI in the Country. The Bill seeks to create a dedicated Authority, namely, 
the  National  Artificial  Intelligence  Technology  Regulatory  Authority 
(NAITRA), which shall have powers of a civil court, to oversee the regulation 
and monitoring of the use of AI and related technologies in the country. The 
Authority will be empowered to set standards, monitor compliance, promote 
research and it is envisaged that the creation of the Authority, would certainly 
address the issue of ethical regulation of AI in the country substantially.    

Hence, this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

 Clause  3  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  constitution  of  the  National 
Artificial  Intelligence  Technology  Regulatory  Authority  to  carry  out  the 
responsibilities  assigned  to  it.    It  also  provides  for  the  headquarters  of  and 
appointments  of  a  Chairperson,  Members,  officers,  staff  and  experts  to  the 
Authority as well as the provision of salary and allowances to them.  Clause 4 
provides for the duties and functions of the Authority.  Clause 7 provides that 
the Central Government shall provide adequate funds to the Authority.  

The Bill, therefore, if enacted, would involve both non-recurring and 
recurring expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India.  However, at this 
juncture, it is difficult to estimate the actual expenditure likely to be involved. 

7 

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 13 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make 
rules  for  carrying out  the  purposes  of  the  Bill.  As  the  rules  will  relate  to 
matters  of  detail  only,  the  delegation  of  legislative  power  is  of  a  normal 
character.

Notes on Clauses 

Clause  2  read  with  the  First  Schedule  to  the  Bill,  seeks  to  specify  the  rates  at  which 
income-tax is to be levied on income chargeable to tax for the assessment year 2024-2025. 
Further, it lays down the rates at which tax is to be deducted at source during the financial 
year under the Income-tax Act; and the rates at which “advance tax” is to be paid, tax is to 
be  deducted  at  source  from,  or  paid  on,  income  chargeable  under  the  head  “Salaries”  or 
deducted under section 194P of the Income-tax Act and tax is to be calculated and charged 
in special cases for the financial year 2024-2025. 

Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend section 2 of the Income-tax Act relating to definitions.  

Clause (22) of the said section provides the definition of dividend which, inter alia, does 
not  include  any  payment  made  by  a  company  on  purchase  of  its  own  shares  from  a 
shareholder in accordance with the provisions of section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956. 

It is proposed to amend the said clause so as to insert sub-clause (f) therein and omit item 
(iv) to provide that dividend, inter alia, include any payment by a company on purchase of 
its own shares  from a shareholder in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section  68  of the 
Companies Act, 2013.  

These amendments will take effect from 1st October, 2024. 

Clause (42A) of the said section provides that “short-term capital asset” means a capital 
asset held by an assessee for not more than thirty-six months immediately preceding the date 
of its transfer, provided that in the case of a security (other than a unit) listed in a recognized 
stock exchange in India or a unit of the Unit Trust of India established under the Unit Trust 
of India Act, 1963 (52 of 1963) or a unit of an equity oriented fund or a zero coupon bond 
or in case of a share of a company (not being a share listed in a recognised stock exchange) 
or a unit of a Mutual Fund specified under clause (23D) of section 10, which is transferred 
during the period beginning on the 1st day of April, 2014 and ending on the 10th day of July, 
2014, the period of holding for the purposes  of this clause would be twelve months. The 
clause also provides that in the case of a share of a company, not being a share listed in a 
recognised stock exchange in India,  or  an  immovable property,  being  land or building  or 
both, the period of holding for the purposes of the clause would be twenty-four months. 

It is proposed to amend the said clause so as to provide that a “short-term capital asset" 
would  mean  a  capital  asset  held  by  an  assessee  for  not  more  than  twenty-four  months 
immediately preceding the date of its transfer.  

It is further proposed to amend the first proviso so as to substitute the period of thirty-six 
months to twenty-four months in order to align the proviso with the amendment proposed 
above.  

It is also proposed to amend the second proviso to insert the words, brackets, letters and 
figures  “as  it  stood  immediately  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  Finance  (No.2)  Act, 
2024” after the words “had been substituted”.  It is also proposed to omit the third proviso 
thereof.   

This amendment will take effect retrospectively from 23rd July, 2024.

Notes on Clauses 

Clause  2  read  with  the  First  Schedule  to  the  Bill,  seeks  to  specify  the  rates  at  which 
income-tax is to be levied on income chargeable to tax for the assessment year 2024-2025. 
Further, it lays down the rates at which tax is to be deducted at source during the financial 
year under the Income-tax Act; and the rates at which “advance tax” is to be paid, tax is to 
be  deducted  at  source  from,  or  paid  on,  income  chargeable  under  the  head  “Salaries”  or 
deducted under section 194P of the Income-tax Act and tax is to be calculated and charged 
in special cases for the financial year 2024-2025. 

Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend section 2 of the Income-tax Act relating to definitions.  

Clause (22) of the said section provides the definition of dividend which, inter alia, does 
not  include  any  payment  made  by  a  company  on  purchase  of  its  own  shares  from  a 
shareholder in accordance with the provisions of section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956. 

It is proposed to amend the said clause so as to insert sub-clause (f) therein and omit item 
(iv) to provide that dividend, inter alia, include any payment by a company on purchase of 
its own shares  from a shareholder in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section  68  of the 
Companies Act, 2013.  

These amendments will take effect from 1st October, 2024. 

Clause (42A) of the said section provides that “short-term capital asset” means a capital 
asset held by an assessee for not more than thirty-six months immediately preceding the date 
of its transfer, provided that in the case of a security (other than a unit) listed in a recognized 
stock exchange in India or a unit of the Unit Trust of India established under the Unit Trust 
of India Act, 1963 (52 of 1963) or a unit of an equity oriented fund or a zero coupon bond 
or in case of a share of a company (not being a share listed in a recognised stock exchange) 
or a unit of a Mutual Fund specified under clause (23D) of section 10, which is transferred 
during the period beginning on the 1st day of April, 2014 and ending on the 10th day of July, 
2014, the period of holding for the purposes  of this clause would be twelve months. The 
clause also provides that in the case of a share of a company, not being a share listed in a 
recognised stock exchange in India,  or  an  immovable property,  being  land or building  or 
both, the period of holding for the purposes of the clause would be twenty-four months. 

It is proposed to amend the said clause so as to provide that a “short-term capital asset" 
would  mean  a  capital  asset  held  by  an  assessee  for  not  more  than  twenty-four  months 
immediately preceding the date of its transfer.  

It is further proposed to amend the first proviso so as to substitute the period of thirty-six 
months to twenty-four months in order to align the proviso with the amendment proposed 
above.  

It is also proposed to amend the second proviso to insert the words, brackets, letters and 
figures  “as  it  stood  immediately  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  Finance  (No.2)  Act, 
2024” after the words “had been substituted”.  It is also proposed to omit the third proviso 
thereof.   

This amendment will take effect retrospectively from 23rd July, 2024. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
155 

Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 10 of the Income-tax Act relating to incomes 

not included in total income.  

Clause (4D) of the said section, inter alia, provides that any income accrued or arisen 
to, or received by a specified fund, shall not be included in computing the total income of a 
previous year subject to the conditions mentioned therein. 

It is proposed to insert a new sub-item in item (I) of sub-clause (i) of clause (c) of the 
Explanation to said clause (4D) to expand the scope of specified fund so as to include a fund 
established or incorporated in India in the form of a trust or a company or a limited liability 
partnership or a body corporate, which has been granted a certificate as a retail scheme or an 
Exchange Traded Fund and is regulated under the International Financial Services Centres 
Authority (Fund Management) Regulations, 2022, made under the  International Financial 
Services Centres Authority Act, 2019 and satisfies such conditions as may be provided by 
rules. 

It is further proposed to insert a new clause (15B) in the said section to provide that any 
income of a foreign company from lease rentals by whatever name called, of cruise ships, 
received from a specified company which operates such ship or ships in India, where such 
foreign  company  and  the  specified  company  are  the  subsidiaries  of  the  same  holding 
company, and such income is received or accrues or arises in India for any assessment year 
beginning on the 1st day of April, 2030. 

The  Explanation proposed to the said  clause  provides the  meaning  of the  expressions 

“specified company”, “holding company” and “subsidiary company”. 

These amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2025 and will, accordingly, apply in 

relation to the assessment year 2025-2026 and subsequent years. 

Clause (23C) of said section provides exemption to the income of certain entities.  

Sub-clauses (iv), (v), (vi) and (via) of clause (23C) of the said section provide exemption 
to the income received by any person on behalf of any fund or trust or institution or university 
or other educational institutions or hospital or other institutions which may be approved or 
provisionally approved by the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner. 

First proviso to clause (23C), inter alia, provides that  exemption to the fund or trust or 
institution  or  university  or  other  educational  institution  or  hospital  or  other  medical 
institution referred to in sub-clause (iv) or sub-clause  (v) or sub-clause (vi) or sub-clause 
(via), under the respective sub-clauses, shall not be available to it unless such fund or trust 
or  institution  or  university  or  other  educational  institution  or  hospital  or  other  medical 
institution  makes  an  application  in  the  prescribed  form  and  manner  to  the  Principal 
Commissioner or Commissioner, for grant of approval within the time as provided under the  
said  proviso  and  the  said  fund  or  trust  or  institution  or  university  or  other  educational 
institution or hospital or other medical institution is approved under the second proviso. 

Second proviso to clause (23C) of the said section, provides for the procedure for granting 
approval to by the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner, on receipt of an application 
made under the first proviso. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
156 

It is also proposed to amend the first  and  second  provisos  to  clause (23C) of  the  said 
section to restrict their applicability to the applications made before the 1st October, 2024.  

It is also proposed to insert a new proviso to clause (23C) of the said section so as to 
provide that no approval under second proviso shall be granted in relation to any application 
made on or after the 1st October, 2024. 

These amendments will take effect from 1st October, 2024.   

Clause (23EE) of the said section provides exemption to the specified income of Core 
Settlement Guarantee Fund, set up by a recognised clearing corporation in accordance with 
the regulations.  

Clause  (i)  of  the  Explanation  to  the  said  clause  defines  the  expression  “recognised 

clearing corporation” and clause (ii) thereof defines the expression “regulations”. 

It is also proposed to amend clause (i) of the said Explanation to expand the definition of 
the  expression  “recognised  clearing  corporation”  by  including  the  recognised  clearing 
corporation as defined in clause (n) of sub-regulation (1) of regulation 2 of the International 
Financial Services Centres Authority (Market Infrastructure Institutions) Regulations, 2021 
made under the International Financial Services Centres Authority Act, 2019 also within its 
scope. 

It is also proposed to amend clause (ii) of the said Explanation to expand the definition 
of the term “regulations” by including the International Financial Services Centres Authority 
(Market  Infrastructure  Institutions)  Regulations,  2021  made  under  the  International 
Financial Services Centres Authority Act, 2019 also within its scope. 

Clause (23FB) of the said section,  inter alia,  provides  that any income of  a  venture

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

Government  has  introduced  several  reforms  to  enhance  transparency  in 

examinations for recruitment as well as admission to higher education institutions.   
These, inter alia, include introducing self-attestation; shortening examination cycle 
(from 18-22 months to 6-10 months); doing away with interviews for recruitment 
to  Group  ‘C’  and  ‘D’;  introduction  of  computer  based  tests  and  issuance  of 
appointment letters through digital means under “Rojgar Mela”. 

2.  Malpractices  in  public  examinations  lead  to  delays  and  cancellation  of 
examinations adversely impacting the prospects of millions of youth. At present, 
there is no specific substantive law to deal with unfair means adopted or offences 
committed by various entities involved in the conduct of public examinations by 
the Central Government and its agencies. Therefore, it is imperative that elements 
that  exploit  vulnerabilities  of  examination  system  are  identified  and  effectively 
dealt with by a comprehensive Central legislation. 

3.  The  objective  of  the  Bill  is  to  bring  greater  transparency,  fairness  and 
credibility to the public examination systems and to reassure the youth that their 
sincere and genuine efforts will be fairly rewarded and their future is safe. The Bill 
is  aimed  at  effectively  and  legally  deterring  persons,  organised  groups  or 
institutions that indulge in various unfair means and adversely impact the public 
examination systems for monetary or wrongful gains. Candidate as defined in the 
Bill shall not be liable for action within the purview of the Bill and shall continue 
to be covered under the extant administrative provisions of the concerned public 
examination authority. 

4. The Bill shall serve as a model draft for States to adopt at their discretion.   
This would aid States in preventing the criminal elements from disrupting conduct 
of their State level public examinations. 

5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives. 

NEW DELHI;                                                                           DR. JITENDRA SINGH.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause  2  of  the  Bill  provides  for  definitions  used  in  the  Bill.  Item  (e)  of       

sub-clause (1) of clause 2 provides for the definition of the expression “conduct of 
public  examination”  which  empowers  the  Central  Government  to  prescribe  the 
procedures, processes and activities, for being adopted for the conduct of public 
examination. 

2. The matters in respect of which rules may be made in accordance with the 
provisions of the Bill are matters of procedure and detail and it is not practicable 
to provide for them in the Bill itself.  

3. The delegation of legislative power is, therefore, of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The Jammu and Kashmir Local Bodies Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 seeks 
to amend certain provisions of the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayati Raj Act, 1989, 
the  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Municipal  Act,  2000  and  the  Jammu  and  Kashmir 
Municipal Corporation Act, 2000 (the Acts) in consonance with the provisions of 
the Part IX and Part IXA of the Constitution. 

2.  Part IX and Part IXA of the Constitution relates to  "the Panchayats" and 
"the  Municipalities".  Clause  (6)  of articles  243D  and 243T  of the  Constitution 
empowers the Legislature of a State to make provision for reservation of seats in 
any "Panchayat"  and "Municipality"  in  favour  of backward  classes  of citizens. 
However, the Acts of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir has no provision 
for reservation of seats for  "Other Backward Classes" in the Panchayats and the 
Municipalities. 

3.  According  to  articles  243K  and  243ZA  of  the  Constitution,  the 
superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls for, and 
the  conduct of all  elections to  the  Panchayats  and Municipalities  is vested  in  a 
"State Election Commission" consisting of a "State Election Commissioner". The 
similar provision  was  incorporated  in  the  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Panchayati  Raj 
Act,  1989.  However, as per Municipal laws of the Union territory of the Jammu 
and  Kashmir  the  conduct  of all  elections  to  the  Municipalities  and  Municipal 
Corporations lies with "the Chief Electoral Officer" of Jammu and Kashmir. 

4.  Proviso to  clause  (2)  of article  243K of the  Constitution  envisages  that 
the  State Election Commissioner shall not be removed from  his  office except in 
like manner and on the like grounds as a Judge of a High Court and the conditions 
of  service  of  the  State  Election  Commissioner  shall  not  be  varied  to  his 
disadvantage after his appointment.  But, section 36B of the Jammu and Kashmir 
Panchayati Raj Act, 1989 provides that the State Election Commissioner shall not 
be removed from his office except by an order made by the Lieutenant Governor 
on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity after an inquiry conducted by 
a sitting or a retired judge of the High Court, on a reference made to him by the 
Lieutenant Governor.  The provisions pertaining to  State Election Commissioner 
in  the  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Panchayati  Raj  Act,  1989  are  at  variance  with  the 
provisions of the Constitution. 

5.  In  order to  provide reservation to  the  "Other Backward Classes"  in  the 
Panchayats and the Municipalities  in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir 
and to bring consistency in the local bodies laws of the Union territory of Jammu 
and Kashmir with the provisions of the Constitution,  it has  become necessary to 
amend certain provisions of the Acts and to introduce a Bill in Parliament, namely, 
the Jammu and Kashmir Local Bodies Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024.  With this, 
justice will be ensured to  the citizens of Other Backward Classes  of Jammu and 
Kashmir for the first time after 75  years of independence. 

6.  The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

enacted, would not involve any expenditure either recurring or non-recurring from 
and out of the Consolidated fund oflndia.

Order,  1950  and  the  Constitution  (Scheduled  Tribes)  Order,  1950.  The

communities  proposed  in  the  Bill  under  the  continuing  schemes  meant  for  the 
welfare of the Scheduled Tribes. 

2.  It  is  not  possible  to  estimate  the  likely  additional  expenditure  to  be 
incurred on this account at this stage. However, the expenditure, if any, shall be 
accommodated within the approved budgetary outlay of the Government.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The  Water  (Prevention  and  Control  of  Pollution)  Act,  1974  was  enacted 
under article 252 of the Constitution to provide for the prevention and control of 
water pollution and the maintaining and restoring of wholesomeness of water, for 
the establishment, with a view to carrying out the purposes aforesaid, of Boards 
for the prevention and control of water pollution, for conferring on and assigning 
to such Boards powers and functions relating thereto and for matters connected 
therewith. As required by  the provisions of  article 252 of  the Constitution,  the 
Legislative Assemblies of States of Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan have passed 
Resolution  for  amending  the  Water  (Prevention  and  Control  of  Pollution)  Act, 
1974 as proposed in the present Bill.  

2. The  corner  stone  of  democratic  governance  lies  in  the  Government
trusting its own people and institutions. A web of outdated rules and regulations 
causes trust deficit. It has been the endeavour of the Government to achieve the 
principle of “Minimum Government Maximum Governance”. The said Act, inter 
alia, prescribes various penal provisions for non-compliance or contravention of 
the  provisions  thereof  punishable  with  imprisonments.  The  imprisonment 
provisions for minor violations which are simple infringements not leading to any 
injury to humans or damage to the environment many a times cause harassment 
to business and citizen and is not in consonance with the spirit of Ease of Living 
and Ease of Doing Business.  

3. The Bill proposes for rationalising criminal provisions and ensuring that
citizens,  business  and  the  companies  operate  without  fear  of  imprisonment  for 
minor, technical or procedural defaults. Also the nature of penal consequence of 
an  offence  committed  must  be  commensurate  with  the  seriousness  of  offence. 
This Bill seeks to establish a balance between the severity of the offence and the 
gravity of the punishment provided in this regard.    

4. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Bill, 2024,

inter alia, seeks to provide— 

(a) the manner of nomination of the chairman of the State Pollution

Control Board is to be prescribed by the Central Government; 

(b) that  the  Central  Government  may  exempt  certain  categories  of
industrial plants from the application of section 25 relating to restriction on 
new outlets and new discharges;  

(c) that the Central Government may issue guidelines on the matters
relating to the grant, refusal or cancellation of consent by any State Board 
for  establishment  of  any  industry,  operation  or  process,  or  treatment  and 
disposal system or bringing into use of new or altered outlets, etc.; 

(d) for  decriminalising  of  minor  offences  and  replacing  it  with

monetary penalty in case of continuation of contravention; 

(e) the manner of adjudication of penalties by the adjudicating officer
who shall be an officer of not less than the rank of Joint Secretary to the 
Government of India or Secretary to the State Government; 

(f) punishment for failure to comply with the provisions of section 25
relating  to  restrictions on  new  outlets and  new discharges  and section  26 
relating to existing discharge of sewage or trade effluent, etc.;  

(g)

the  amount  of  penalty  imposed  is  to  be  credited  to  the
Environmental  Protection  Fund  established  under  section  16  of  the 
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.     
5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

recurring or non-recurring from the Consolidated Fund of India.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause  2  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  amend  section  4  to  confer  power  upon  the 
Central  Government  to  make  rules  to  provide  for  manner  of  nomination  of 
chairman of State Pollution Control Board.  

Clause  3  of  the  Bill  seeks  to  amend  section  5  to  confer  power  upon  the 
Central Government to make rules to provide the other terms and conditions of 
service of the chairman. 

Clause 10 of the Bill, inter alia, seeks to insert section 45B which confers 
power upon the Central Government to make rules to provide for the manner to 
hold an inquiry and to impose penalty by the adjudicating officer for the purpose 
of the Bill.  

The rules made by the Central Government shall be laid, as soon as they are 

made, before each House of Parliament. 

The  matters  in  respect  of  which  such  rules  may  be  made  are  matters  of 
procedures and administrative details and it is not practicable to provide for them 
in  the Bill  itself.  The  delegation  of  legislative  power  is, therefore, of  a normal 
character.

Amendment  of 
Constitution 
(Scheduled 
Tribes)  Order, 
1950.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

Scheduled  Tribes  have  been  defined  in  clause  (25)  of  article  366  of  the 
Constitution as "such tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such 
tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes 
for the purposes of this Constitution.".  

2. Article 342 of the Constitution provides as under:—

“342.  Scheduled  Tribes.—(1)  The  President  may  with  respect  to  any 
State or  Union  territory,  and  where it  is a State,  after  consultation  with  the 
Governor  thereof,  by  public  notification,  specify  the  tribes  or  tribal 
communities or parts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities which 
shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Tribes 
in relation to that State or Union territory, as the case may be.  

(2) Parliament  may  by  law  include  in  or  exclude  from  the  list  of
Scheduled Tribes specified in a notification issued under clause (1) any tribe 
or tribal community or part of or group within any tribe or tribal community, 
but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall not be 
varied by any subsequent notification.".  

3. According to the provisions of article 342 of the Constitution, the first list
of  the  Scheduled  Tribes  was  notified  during  the  year  1950  in  respect  of  various 
States and Union territories, vide the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950, 
respectively. The list of Scheduled Tribes of Andhra Pradesh was last modified vide, 
The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 (No. 6 of 2014.) 

4. On  the  basis  of  recommendation  of  the  State  Government  of  Andhra
Pradesh and after consultation with the Registrar General of India and the National 
Commission for Scheduled Tribes, it is proposed to modify the list of Scheduled 
Tribes  in  respect  of  the  State  of  Andhra  Pradesh  by  amending  the  Constitution 
(Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950.  

5. The  Constitution  (Scheduled  Tribes)  Order  (Amendment)  Bill,  2024
proposes to amend the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950 in the Schedule, 
in PART I.—Andhra Pradesh, C.O. 22,—  

(a) for entry 25, the following entry shall be substituted, namely:—

“25. Porja, Bondo Porja, Khond Porja, Parangiperja”

(b) for entry 28, the following entry shall be substituted, namely:—

“28.  Savaras,  Kapu  Savaras,  Maliya  Savaras,  Konda  Savaras,

Khutto Savaras”

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

The Bill seeks to amend the list of Scheduled Tribes in the State of Andhra 
Pradesh  by  amending  the  Constitution  (Scheduled  Tribes)  Order,  1950.  The 
amendment in the list of Scheduled Tribes relating to the State of Andhra Pradesh 
may entail some additional recurring and non-recurring expenditure on account of 
benefits to be provided to the persons belonging to the communities proposed in the 
Bill under the continuing schemes meant for the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes. 

2. It is not possible to estimate the likely additional expenditure to be incurred
on  this  account  at  this  stage.  However,  the  expenditure,  if  any,  shall  be 
accommodated within the approved budgetary outlay of the Government.

Bill  No.  I of 2024

THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF WOMEN AT WORKPLACE 
(PREVENTION, PROHIBITION AND REDRESSAL) 
AMENDMENT BILL, 2024

A

BILL

 further to amend the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition 
and Redressal) Act, 2013.

B(cid:3454)  it  enacted  by  Parliament  in  the  Seventy-  fifth  Year  of  the  Republic  of  India  as 

follows:–

1. (1) This Act may be called the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention,

Prohibition and Redressal) Amendment Act, 2024.

Short title and 
commencement.

 (2)  It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification

in the Official Gazette, appoint.

2. In  the  Sexual  Harassment  of  Women  at  Workplace  (Prevention,  Prohibition  and

Redressal) Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the principal Act), in section 9:–

Amendment of 
section 9

(a) in sub-section (1), for the words “within a period of three months from the date of

incident” and “within a period of three months from the date of last incident”, the words 

“within a period of one year from the date of incident” and “within a period of one year from 

5

the date of last incident” respectively, shall be substituted; and

(b) in the second proviso to sub-section (1), the words “not exceeding three months”
shall be omitted.

   Omission of 
section 10.

3. In the principal Act, section 10 shall be omitted.

STATEMENT  OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  Sexual  Harassment  of  Women  at  Workplace  (Prevention,  Prohibition  and 

Redressal)  Act,  2013  represents  a  significant  step  towards  protection  of  women  against 

sexual  harassment  at  the  workplace.  However,  considering  the  lived  experiences  of  the 

women workforce and the realities of the modern workplace, the Act needs to address two 

important issues

Pensions    Section  9  stipulates  a  limitation  period  of  three  months  for  filing 

complaints, further  extendable  by  three  months, provided  that the  Internal  Committee  or 

Local Committee (as the case may be) is satisfied that the circumstances were such which 

prevented the woman from filing a complaint within the said period. This limitation period 

is  inapposite  since  in  cases  involving  sexual  harassment,  women  may  be  so  traumatised 

as  to  render  filing  of  the  complaint  impossible  until  such  time  they  have  recouped  their 

strength. Placing a maximum limit of six months on such complaints does great injustice to 

the aggrieved woman. 

Section 10 provides the aggrieved woman with the option of settling the complaint 

through conciliation. This provision is highly problematic since it fails to take into account 

the possibility of influencing, coercing, pressuring or intimidating the complainant to arrive 

at a settlement. While there are certain areas (such as contractual matters) where conciliation 

may be fruitful, an attempt to reach a compromise in matters of sexual harassment of women 

greatly undermines the dignity of women. 

This Bill intends to remedy these problems by amending the Sexual Harassment of 

Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. It provides that the 

basic limitation period for filing complaints shall be fixed at one year, which shall be further 

extendable, without any upper limit, by the Internal Committee or Local Committee (as the 

case may be), upon satisfaction that the circumstances prevented the woman from filing the 

complaint within the limitation period. Additionally, it proposes the deletion of the provision 

for conciliation in its entirety. 

This Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

is not so constituted, within a period of three months from the date of incident and in case 
of a series of incidents, within a period of three months from the date of last incident:  

      Provided that where such complaint cannot be made in writing, the Presiding Officer 
or any Member of the Internal Committee or the Chairperson or any Member of the Local

AS INTRODUCED IN THE RAJYA SABHA
ON 2ND FEBRUARY, 2024  

THE INDIAN CONTRACT (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2024

Bill No. IV of 2024 

A 

BILL 
further to amend the Indian Contract Act, 1872. 

BE it enacted by Parliament in the Seventy-fifth Year of the Republic 

of  India as follows:— 

1. (1) This Act may be called the Indian Contract (Amendment) Act, 2024.

(2) It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may,

2. In Section 15 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872:–

Short  title  and 
commencement. 

Amendment  of 
section 15. 

10 

(i)

(ii)
(iii)

for the words “any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code”, the words
“any act, the committing of which or threatening to commit which is
punishable by any law for the time being in force”, be substituted.
the marginal entry “45 of 1860” shall be omitted.
in the Explanation:–

(a) for  the  words  “the  Indian  Penal  Code”,  the  words  “the  law

violated”, be  substituted.

(b) the marginal entry “45 of 1860” shall be omitted.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The  definition  of  ‘Coercion’  provided  for  in  the  Indian  Contract  Act, 

1872  is  not  exhaustive.  It  does  not  apply  to  situations  in  modern  times  where 
coercion can be induced through numerous  ways.  The 13th Report of the  Law 

Commission of India, which was chaired by Shri M. C. Setalvad, also suggested 

amending the current definition under Section 15 to make it comprehensive. 

2. Currently,  the  definition  focuses  on  the  words  “any  act  forbidden

by the Indian Penal Code”.  The purpose of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, which 

has now been repealed and replaced by the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 is to 

create  offences  and  not  merely  forbid  them.  There  are  laws  other  than  the 

Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita performing the same function.  So far it has been up to 

the  courts  to  interpret  the  meaning  of  the  phrase  in  question  and  differentiate 

between  “forbidden  by  the  Indian  Penal  Code”  and  “punishable  by  the  Indian 

Penal  Code”.  This  kind  of  interpretation  varies  from  court  to  court  thereby 

creating discrepancies.  

3. The current definition is problematic as firstly, the Bharatiya Nyaya

Sanhita only declares offences “punishable” and not “forbidden” and secondly, 

in  the  present  context,  there  are  many  laws  that  define  and  punish  offences  in 

India. The present definition must be replaced with a wider expression covering 

all the offences forbidden by law in India.  

Hence this bill.

15 

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The  Constitution  of  India  states  that  the  executive  power  of  the  State 
vests  in  the  Governor.  The  Governor  being  a  nominal  head  of  the  State  is 
bound  by  the  aid  and  advice  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  of  the  State.  The 
Governor is appointed by the President of India, on the recommendations of 
the Union Cabinet. The Governor serves at the pleasure of the President. The 
Governor is therefore an unelected figurehead of the State Government.  

Article 361 confers immunity from civil and criminal prosecution on the 
President  and  the  Governor.  The  treatment  of  the  Governor  on  par  with  the 
President  of  India  is  fallacious  since  the  President  of  India  is  elected  by  an 
electoral  college  comprising  elected  representatives  of  the  Houses  of 
Parliament  and  the  Legislatures  of  the  States.  Therefore,  the  President  is  a 
democratically  elected  head  of  the  Union,  whereas  the  Governor  is  a  mere 
appointee. In fact, Article 157 only prescribes the most basic qualifications for 
appointment  as  Governor.  Thus,  equating  the  President  and  the  Governor  in 
matters of immunity is undesirable.  

That apart, the Governor is bound by the aid and advice of the Council 
of  Ministers  of  the  State.  The  Chief  Minister  of  the  State  does  not  enjoy 
complete  immunity  from  prosecution.  He  can  be  prosecuted  after  obtaining 
sanction. Similarly, there should be a provision to prosecute the Governor for 
criminal offences after obtaining the sanction of the President, who appoints 
him.  The  Chief  Minister  of  a  State  does  not  enjoy  any  immunity  from  civil 
proceedings. There is no reason why a Governor   should get immunity from 
civil  prosecution  for  civil  wrongs  or  damages  caused  by  him.  Thus,  it  is 
undesirable to place the Governor at a better position than the democratically 
elected  Chief  Minister  of  the  State,  who  enjoys  the  confidence  of  the 
Legislature of the State.  

 Allegations  of  corruption,  sexual  offences,  inciting  violence  etc.  have 
been made against some Governors. The idea that a person, howsoever high, 
be  beyond  the  reach  of  Courts  and  the  justice  administration  system  is  a 
colonial  relic  and  cannot  be  part  of  a  democracy  administered  by  a  written 
Constitution and the rule of law. If Governors misuse their office to provoke 
breach  of  peace  or  act  against  public  interest,  they  must  face  the  legal 
consequences.  

The immunity under Article 361(1) to the Governor from answering to 
any court for the exercise and performance of his official duties is sufficient 
protection  to  ensure  that  a  Governor  does  not  answer  cases  filed  against  his 
official  decisions  personally.  However,  the  immunity  need  not  extend  to 
criminal  offences  or  civil  wrongs  committed  by  a  Governor  in  his  personal 
capacity.  Absolute  immunity  to  an  unelected  figure  is  antithetical  to  our 
constitutional morality and basic structure. 

It  is  therefore,  proposed  to  amend  article  361  to  achieve  the  above 

objectives. 

        Hence, this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

        The  influence  money  exerts  in  corrupting  the  democratic  process  is 
undeniable  and  sadly,  this  is  true  now,  more  than  ever.  In  our  increasingly 
connected, media heavy world, political advertisements are omnipresent and an 
essential  part  of  any  campaign.  Unregulated,  they  provide  a  platform  for 
candidates to propagate patent untruths. This severely undermines the right to 
accurate information based on which a voter can make his or her decision. The 
seriousness of these issues is amplified by the extent to which it has become a 
systematic part of promoting one‘s election. The money spent on unethical paid 
news and disguised political advertisements, is rising at an exponential rate in 
both national as well as regional media. 

  In  PUCL  v.  Union  of  India  (2003)  4  SCC  399,  the  Supreme  Court  held 
that availability of impartial, proper and relevant information about the election 
candidates fosters and promotes freedom of speech and expression. Paid news 
distorts  this  right.  As  per  the  2010  Press  Council  Sub-Committee  report  on 
Paid News, it was suggested that the act of publishing news items in exchange 
for  consideration  should  be  construed  as  electoral  malpractice  with  a 
punishment  of  minimum  2  years  imprisonment.  The  Election  Commission  of 
India  in  its  2012  circular,  which  was  later  incorporated  in  the  Handbook  for 
Media  for  Lok  Sabha  General  Elections,  proposed  that  the  Representation  of 
the  People  Act,  1951,  should  be  amended  to  prevent  the  publishing  and 
abetment to publish any paid news for furthering the prospects of a candidate‘s 
election.  In  2014,  TRAI  in  its  recommendations  on  media  ownership  also 
recommended  that  the  term  ‗paid  news‘  should  be  comprehensively  defined 
and a proper framework for scrutinizing complaints and taking punitive actions 
should be established.  

  In the United Kingdom, there is a blanket ban on telecasting paid political 
advertisements  on  television  and  radio.  This  prohibition  also  extends  to  any 
advertisement  which  tends  to  influence  public  opinion  on  a  matter  of  general 
controversy. As per the Commonwealth Electoral Act, 1918 of Australia, it is 
mandatory  for  unfolding  the  details  of  any  electoral  advertisement,  handbill, 
pamphlet, poster or notice that contains electoral matter. Similarly in Canada, 
the  Canada  Election  Act,  2000,  sets  provisions  for  adequately  disclosing  the 
details of any electoral advertising.   

 Currently,  the  guidelines  for  disclosing  political  paid  advertisements  are 
not  adequately  framed  and  uniform.  To  check  disguised  paid  political 
advertisements,  the  disclosure  provisions  have  to  be  made  compulsory  for  all 
media  firms  to  assist  the  public  in  identifying  the  nature  of  content  (whether 
sponsored  or  editorial  content)  and  keep  a  vigilant  track  of  transactions 
between the media and election candidates.  

  Hence, this Bill.

 AS INTRODUCED IN THE RAJYA SABHA

THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE (AMENDMENT) 
 BILL, 2024 

Bill No. VI of 2024 

A 
BILL 

further to amend the Representation of the People Act, 1951. 

         BE it enacted by Parliament in the Seventy- fifth Year of the Republic of India 
 as follows: 

1.

2.

5 

  43 of 1951 

(1)  This Act may be called the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act,
2024.

Short title and 
commencement. 

(2) It shall come into force at once.

In section 86 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (hereinafter referred
to  as  the  principal  Act),  in  sub-section  (7),  for  the  words  “endeavour  shall  be
made  to  conclude  the  trial  within  six  months”,  the  words  “shall  be  concluded
within six months”, shall be substituted.

Amendment of 
section 86. 

110 

3. 

In  Section  116A  of  the  principal  Act,  after  sub-section  (2),  the  following  new 
sub-section shall be inserted, namely: 

Amendment of 
section 116A. 

“(3) Every appeal preferred under sub-section (2) shall be disposed of within six 
months  from  the  date  of  its  filing  and  the  proceedings  shall  be  conducted  on 
day-to-day basis.” 

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

Elections are perennial phenomena in our country; be it the General Elections 
to  the  Lok  Sabha  and  Legislative  Assemblies,  elections  to  the  Rajya  Sabha  and 
Legislative  Councils  or  Bye-elections.  As  is  the  case  everywhere,  elections  are 
fervently  contested  in  our  country  and  there  are  a  lot  of  stakes  involved  in  all  these 
elections. 

2.
The  Election  Commission  has  been  vested  with  the  task  of  conducting  the
elections.    As  per  the  provisions  of  the  Representation  of  the  People  Act,  1951  (RP
Act, 1951), all the candidates/ parties have to adhere to the norms fixed for contesting
these elections. At times, when these norms are violated, the aggrieved party is free to
approach the High Court, which has been given the original jurisdiction in this regard,
for deciding election disputes.

3.
The grounds on which the election of a candidate can be challenged are outlined
in  the  RP  Act,  1951.    Although  Section  86  of  the  RP  Act,  1951  provides  that  all
endeavours shall be made by the High Court to conclude the trial within 6 months, in
practice,  it  has  been  observed  that,  the  decision  on  election  petitions  are  pronounced
when  the  term  of  the  elected  person  is  about  to  expire  or  has  already  expired.  After
announcement  of  the  decision  of  the  High  Court,  the  aggrieved  party  is  entitled  to
approach the Supreme Court under Section 116 A of the RP Act, 1951.  In that section,
there is no time limit being prescribed within which the appeal has to be disposed of.

4.
In 2015, in the case of Mohd. Akbar Vs. Ashok Sahu and Others, the Supreme
Court had expressed its concern over the delay in the disposal of election petitions. The
Court  had  observed  that  very  rarely,  the  election  disputes  are  resolved  during  the
tenure  of  the  winning  candidate,  thereby  reducing  the  adjudicating  process  into  a
mockery  of  justice.  The  Court  had  suggested  that  each  High  Court  should  have  a
dedicated  bench  for  deciding  election  petitions.    Recently,  in  2023,  in  the  case  of
Rajendra Kumar Vs. Kuwar Bhartendra Singh, the Allahabad High Court has observed
that  often  the  delay  is  such  that  the  election  petition  becomes  infructuous,  or  if  it
survives, it would only be for academic purposes. The Court has further observed that
the  High  Courts  have  to  be  more  careful  and  have  to  endeavour  to  decide  election
petition at the earliest, so that it may not render it infructuous due to efflux of time.

5.
Even  after  all  these,  the  situation  in  most  of  the  election  petitions  is  the  same
and it takes considerable time to decide the petitions. It is high time that a period be
fixed  for  both  High  Courts  as  well  as  the  Supreme  Court  within  which  they  should
dispose of election petitions and appeals thereon respectively.

The Bill seeks to stipulate a maximum period of six (6) months from the date of
6.
filing  of  the  election  petition  or  appeal,  as  the  case  may  be,  for  both  the  courts  to
decide on and dispose them of.

Hence, this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

Young couples, particularly women, who go against the religious, cultural norms and/
or societal norms being followed by a person or a group of persons are often subjected to 
various crimes like harassment, violence, sexual abuse and even murder, under the pretext 
of preserving honour. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of such 
crimes across the country.  Such horrendous honour crimes need to be eradicated from the 
society. A clear message should be given to the perpetrators that they will be severely dealt 
with. 

This  Bill  aims  to  achieve  the  said  objective  by  creation  of  a  mechanism,  which  will 
work efficiently to address this social malady and for this purpose it is proposed to declare 
honour crime as a non-bailable offence, prescribing punishments for various honour crimes 
and constitute a National Commission for Protection from Honour Crimes Board to look into 
such matters.

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM

Clause 11 provides for the constitution of the National Commission for Protection from 
Honour Crime and appointment of a Chairperson and Members therein. Clause 13 provides 
for the salary and allowances payable to, and other terms and conditions of service of the 
Chairperson and Members of the Commission, whereas Clause 16 provides for the salary 
and  allowances  payable  to  and  other  terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  the  officers  and 
staff of the Commission. Clause 17 inter alia provides that the Commission shall undertake 
and promote research in the field of eradication of honour crime as well as spread human 
rights  literacy  and  promote  awareness  of  the  safeguards  available  for  protections  of  these 
rights amongst various sections of the society through all available means. Clause 20 of the 
Bill provides that the Central Government, shall after due appropriation made by Parliament 
by law in this behalf, grant such sums of money to the Commission, as it may think fit for 
carrying out the purposes of this Act.

The  Bill,  therefore,  if  enacted,  would  involve  both  non-recurring  and  recurring 
expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. However, at this juncture, it is difficult to 
estimate the actual expenditure likely to be involved.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION

Clause 24 of the Bill empowers the appropriate Government to make rules for carrying 
out the purposes of the Bill. As the rules will relate to matters of detail only, the delegation of 
legislative power is of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

There  has  been  a  significant  shift  in  demographic  patterns  across  the  world  in  the 
21st Century with people leading far longer lives than the previous generation. In India, the 
population share of persons aged over 60 has been increasing at an increasing rate over the 
last few years and is expected to do so in the coming decades as well. With the increased 
life expectancy, empirical studies show that the youthful demographic bulge, considered a 
demographic  dividend,  would  transform  into  a gerontological  bulge  as  the  population  of 
persons above the age of 60 years and 80 years will increase by 326 per cent. and 700 per 
cent. respectively by the year 2050. Besides, the fast changing social matrix is increasingly 
impacting adversely the care, dignity and independence of the elders.   

On the global front, the situation of older persons was highlighted for the first time at 
the World Assembly on Ageing in 1982 in Vienna wherein International Plan of Action on 
Ageing was adopted. It served as an international blue print for development of policies and 
programmes on ageing. Later, the United Nations Principles for Older persons were adopted 
by General Assembly Resolution 46-91 of 16th December, 1991. With the adoption of the 
Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing in 2002 during the second world assembly 
on ageing, consistent efforts are being made to build a society for all ages.  

The  well-being  of  older  persons  was  enshrined  in  the  Constitution  of  India  much 
before it was raised in the international forum. Article 41 of the Constitution enjoins that 
“The State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective 
provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of 
unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of underserved want.” 

However, the focus on caring for the elderly has been inadequate with little attention 
given to creating environments for the development of elderly people. With their children 
migrating to metropolitan cities seeking jobs, parents are often left without company and 
support  in  their  old  age.  India  lacks  dedicated  government  departments  dealing  with  the 
various  facets  of  ageing  including  providing  accessible  healthcare  services,  redressal 
systems  and  financial  opportunities.  Furthermore,  old  age  is  seen  as  a  burden  in  many 
households with senior members being cast out of their homes or left in institutions for the 
elderly away from their family. 

Accordingly,  this  Bill  seeks  to  rewrite  the  narrative  surrounding  ageing  in  Indian 
society  by  proposing  the  development  of  a  positive  outlook  on  ageing.  It  facilitates 
protection and preservation of the rights of elderly citizens of the country and provides for 
the sensitization of the population at large about the challenges faced by the elders in our 
community. Economic opportunities for senior citizens are also stressed upon as financial 
security is crucial in old age with increasing costs of medical expenditure. The formation of 
national and state level Commissions for the elderly allows for streamlining provision of 
services, addressing complaints and improving the standard of living for elderly citizens. 
Rights  of  caregivers  working  for  the  elderly  are  also  incorporated  within  the  Bill.  The 
superlative societal value of our senior citizens cannot be ignored as we take strides towards 
becoming a global superpower in the coming years. 

Hence this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

Clause 6 of the Bill enjoins upon the appropriate Government to take necessary steps 
to ensure that elder persons have an adequate standard of living.  Clauses (v) and (vi) of sub-
section  (2)  of  Clause  7  of  the  Bill  provides  that  the  appropriate  Government  shall  ensure 
financial security of elder persons and sub-section (1) of Clause 8 provides that the appropriate 
Government shall take necessary measures to provide them with residential facilities.  Clause 
9  of  the  Bill  provides  for  setting  up  of  a  National  Helpline,  State  Helplines  and  local 
emergency help centres for providing assistance to the elder persons. Clause 10 provides for 
setting up of a Elder Persons Fund. Clause 12 provides for the salary and allowances of the 
staff appointed at the local emergency help centers. Clause 13 provides for the setting up of a 
National Commission for Elder Care and Clause 15 provides for the salaries and allowances 
to be paid to the members thereof. Clause 19 provides for the salaries and allowances for the 
administrative  and  technical  staff  of  the  National  Commission.  Clause  22 provides  for  the 
setting up of State Commissions for Elder Care and Clause 23 provides for the salaries and 
allowances  to  be  paid  to  the  members  thereof.  Clause  27  provides  for  the  salaries  and 
allowances  of  the  administrative  and  technical  staff  of  the  State  Commissions.  Clause  31 
makes it obligatory for the appropriate Government to provide requisite funds to carry out the 
provisions of the Bill. 

The  Bill,  if  enacted,  will  involve  expenditure,  both  of  recurring  and  non-recurring 
nature, from the Consolidated Fund of India. However, it is not possible at present to estimate 
the actual expenditure that is likely to be involved. 

14

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

         Clause 34 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make provisions through an 
order to remove any difficulties likely to arise in giving effect to the provisions of the Bill, if 
enacted.  Clause  35  empowers  the  appropriate  Government  to  frame  rules  to  carry  out  the 
provisions of the Bill. Clause 36 empowers the National Commission, State Commissions and 
Selection Committees to make regulations, consistent with the provisions of this Bill and the 
rules made thereunder, to carry out the provisions of this Bill. As the rules, regulations and 
order(s) will relate to matters of details only, the delegation of legislative power is of a normal 
character.

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2024

State, is not adequately represented in the  services under the  State 
proportionate to their caste census.”  

5 

2 

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

1. The  Indian  Constitution  is  the  supreme  law  of  this  country  which
guarantees  equality  of  status  and  opportunity.  However,  unequal  cannot
be  treated  equally  and  therefore  the  Indian  Constitution  allows  for
positive  discrimination  to  foster  equality.  The  origins  of  the  reservation
system  may  be  traced  back  to  India’s  old  discriminatory  caste  system.
With  the  object  of  making  Indian  society  a  democratic  and  egalitarian
society,  the  framers of our Constitution framed  the policy of  reservation
so  that  the  oppressed  and  depressed  classes  can  be  joined  in  the
mainstream. The reservations, therefore, were the exception to the general
rule.  Reservations  in  education  and  public  employment  are  granted  to
elevate those regarded socially and educationally backward in the State’s
perspective or when a class of citizens is not properly represented in  the
services  supplied  by  the  State.  Reservation  is  being  offered  to  the
SC/ST/OBC class of citizens in India, who have been disadvantaged and
exploited socially and educationally for generations.

2. The Mandal Commission Report published in the year 1980 was the first
to  define  reservations  for  Other  Backward  Classes  of  citizens  in  India.
Before  the  Mandal  Commission,  caste  discrimination  existed  on  social,
economic,  and  political  levels.  The  living  standards  of  the  Scheduled
Castes,  Scheduled  Tribes,  and  Backward  Class  families  were  deemed
much  poorer  than  the  mainstream  population,  including  Hindu  forward
castes  and  other  religious  groups.  Therefore,  the  Mandal  Commission
recommended  to  grant  27%  reservations  to  Other  Backward  Class
citizens.

3. Over  the  years,  there  has  been  unrest  amongst  the  citizens  belonging  to
the  socially  and  educationally  backward  classes  for  not  being  treated
fairly and equally and that there is no level playing field when compared
to  the  socially  and  educationally  forward  citizens.  The  concept  of
reservations introduced to uplift the socially and educationally backward
classes  of  citizens  for  the  injustice  being  done  to  them  generation  after
generation  did  not  achieve  any  greater  results  due  to  disparity  in  the
quantum  of  reservations  compared  to  their  population.  The  fact  remains
that  the  reservation  at  27%  offered  to  the  Other  Backward  Classes  of
citizens  on  the  basis  of  the  1931  census  over  a  period  of  time  is  not
sufficient that too for a community, which is the largest in population in
this  country.  The  accumulation  of  the  deficit  in  honoring  their  due
representations and reservations  for socially  and  educationally backward
classes of citizens each year, again brings out inequality in the society.

4. Constitution being a organic document should stretch itself to take care of
the  demand  and  needs  of  the  society.  The  founding  fathers  of  our
Constitution  have  designedly  couched  Articles  14,  15  and  16  in
comprehensive phraseology so that the frail and emaciated section of the
people  living  in  poverty,  rearing  in  obscurity,  possessing  no  wealth  or
influence, having no education, much less higher education and suffering
from  social  repression  and  oppression  should  not  be  denied  of  equality
before law and equal protection of the laws and equal opportunity in the
matters  of  public  employment  or  subjected  to  any  prohibition    or
discrimination  on  grounds  of  religion,  race,  caste,  sex  or  place  of  birth.
For  achieving  these  objects,  provisions  were  inserted  under  Articles  15
and  16  for  providing  reservations  to  the  SC,  ST  and  Socially  and
Educationally Backward Classes of citizens.

3 

5. The  Mandal  Commission  while  determining  the  criteria  for  defining  the
socially and educationally backward classes of citizens identified that the
Other  Backward  Classes  (OBCs)  constituted  nearly  52%  of  the  Indian
population on the basis of the 1931 census. That after considering all facts
and  circumstances,  the  Commission  initially  recommended  for reserving
52%  of  all  posts  under  the  Central  Government  and  in  educational
institutions  both  under  the  Central  and  State  Governments,  for  the
backward classes of citizens. It was due to the legal constraint of 50% cap
on  all  reservations  that  initially  the  quantum  of  Other  Backward  Class
reservation  was  fixed  at  27%,  in  order  to  arrive  at  a  figure  which  when
added to the 22.5% reservation for SCs and STs remains below 50%.  The
the  93rd
reservation  of  27% 
Constitutional amendment with effect from 20.1.2006. The eighteen years
of implementation of reservation in education  has not enabled the entire
socially  and  educationally  backward  classes  of  citizens  to  realise  the
benefits  of  the  reservation  and  disparity  still  prevails  in  the  society  and
there is no achievement of level playing field. Moreover, the reservation
in appointments introduced in the year 1981 also did not enable the Other
Backward  Classes  of  citizens  to  get  their  rightful  share  in  employment
and still there is inadequate representation in employment including in the
promotional posts. Considering the fact that there exists no mathematical
limit  of  50%  in  aggregate  for  reservations,  therefore  it  is  essential  that
reservations  for  the  backward  classes  of  citizens  be  increased  in
proportion to the increase in their population over the years and shall be
made proportionate to the Caste Census.

in  education  was 

introduced  after 

6. Therefore, to achieve substantive equality, it is imperative that Articles 15
and 16 of the Constitution should be amended to increase the quantum of
reservations  of  Socially  and  Educationally  Backward  Classes  of  citizens
proportionate to their Caste Census.

 Hence, this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The  fundamental  right  to  life  enshrined  in  Article  21  of  the  Constitution  of  India 
may be interpreted to include the right to live with human dignity, which includes the Right 
to  Food  and  other  basic  necessities,  and  is  therefore 
Thus,  our  Constitution  guarantees  to   all  the  citizens  of  the  country,  the  ‘right  to  be  free 
from hunger and malnourishment’ and to have physical and economic access at all times to 
adequate  food  -  in  quality  and  quantity  -  that  is  nutritious,  culturally  acceptable  and 
can  be  procured  in  a sustained and dignified manner. 

enforceable  under  Article 

32.   

2. The  National  Food  Security  Act,  which  was  enacted  on  July  5,  2013,  approached food 
security from the welfare to rights-based approach. The Act legally entitled up to 75 per cent 
of the  rural  population  and  50  per  cent  of  the  urban  population  to  receive  subsidized  food 
grains  under  the  Targeted  Public  Distribution  System.  About  two-thirds  of  the  population, 
therefore, is covered under the Act to receive highly subsidized food grains.

3. However,  priority  on  the  scientific  component  of  nutrition,  which  is  required  by  the 
beneficiaries,  has often taken a  backseat in India. Instead, the inclination  has been  towards 
increasing the quantity of food rather than providing good quality food. This has resu lted in 
a chronic  state  of  micronutrient  malnourishment  in  the  country,  which  was  aggravated  by 
the  COVID-19  pandemic;  specifically  for  the  most  vulnerable  segments  of  society  like  
women, children and tribal communities residing in inaccessible regions.

4. The National Family Health Survey-5 suggests that the rate of anaemic children under the 
age  of  five  has  increased  from  59  per  cent  in  the  previous  survey  to  65  per  cent.  It  was 
also  observed  that 34.7 per cent  of children under the age of  5 years are wasted (weight is 
too low for the height) and stunted.  It also suggests that 52.2 per cent pregnant women aged 
between 15 and 49 years are anaemic. The previous National Family Health Survey report of 
2015-16,  brought  home  the  widely  anticipated  truth  that,  despite  improvements,  the 
under-nutrition amongst the Scheduled  Tribes  has  remained  much  higher  than  that  for  all 
the  groups  taken  together.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  malnutrition  remains  statistically  a 
significant  issue  in  all  36  States and Union Territories. These worrying indicators necessitate 
increased efforts to address the problem as soon as possible.

Instead  of  the  calorie-centric  strategy  applied  in  the  parent  Act,  the  amendment 

5.
inclusion  of  micronutrients,  which  can  be 
advocates  standardized  framework  for 
ensured  through  institutions  like  anganwadis  and  Mid-Day  Meal  Scheme.  It  is  imperative 
that the goal of such  policies should be  to emphasize on providing adequate nutrition to its 
beneficiaries. Physical and mental wellbeing of these sections must be prioritized, and this is 
only possible if adequate and nutritious food which suits their nutritional needs is provided to 
them. This is because food  security  needs  to  be  defined  by  nutrition  outcomes  rather  than 
merely  access to  food.  Such  an  amendment is the first step in addressing this deficit which  
will also be a step towards building a healthy and inclusive India for our future generations. 

Hence, this Bill.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS

The  rise  of  AI-generated  fake/fraudulent  voice  calls  in  India,  as 
evidenced  by  the  McAfee  report  titled  'The  Artificial  Imposter,'  is  a  pressing 
concern  demanding  legislative  attention.  The  survey's  findings,  encompassing 
7,054 participants from seven countries, reveal a startling truth that over 83 per 
cent. of Indians have fallen victim to these fraudulent calls. Disturbingly, half 
of  the  respondents  admitted  their  inability  to  differentiate  between  authentic 
and AI-generated fake voice calls, resulting in substantial financial losses. 

The  surge  in  online  scams,  particularly  the  fake  voice  call  scam, 
underscores  the  need  for  swift  legislative  action.  Cybercriminals  exploit 
advanced  technology  to  create  deceptive  calls,  with  48  per  cent.    of  affected 
individuals  reporting  losses  exceeding  ₹50,000.  The  vulnerability  of  Indian 
adults  to  voice  scams,  reflected  in  the  survey's  69  per  cent.    uncertainty  in 
identifying cloned voices, necessitates urgent legal measures. 

Therefore, 

the  proposed 

legislation  aims 

to  protect  citizens  by 
introducing stringent measures against fake/malicious/fraudulent voice calls. It 
proposes to amend the Telecom Regulatory  Authority of India  Act, 1997, the 
Information Technology  Act, 2000 and the Bharatiya  Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 in 
order  to  safeguard  citizens  from  the  escalating  threat,  malice,  financial 
exploitation  caused  by  fraudulent  voice  calls.  It  also  emphasizes  public 
awareness about the prevalence of such voice scams, the importance of caller 
for  effective 
verification,  and  collaboration  with 
implementation.  Severe  penalties  are  proposed 
fraudulent 
communication and fortify the legal apparatus against evolving cyber threats.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The  freedom  of  the  media  is  crucial  for  the  functioning  of  a  healthy 
democracy. The media should be independent and should play an impartial role in 
the dissemination of news and information to the public at large, so as to facilitate 
free  and  fair  assessment  of  issues  and  independent  decision  making  amongst  the 
citizens, which is crucial to the healthy functioning of a democracy. The licensing 
powers  being  a  monopoly  in  the  hands  of  the  Executive  often  results  in  a  pliant 
media  as  Journalists  will  hesitate  to  criticize  the  ruling  dispensation  for  fear  of 
legal  hazards.  The  licensing  should  not  be  left  to  the  whims  and  fancies  of  the 
bureaucracy  and  the  ruling  party.  The  Bill  aims  to  correct  this  by  proposing  an 
autonomous  body  for  issuing  licenses  and  revoking  them,  thus  ensuring  free  and 
fair functioning of media.  

Hence, this Bill.

FINANCIAL MEMORANDUM 

Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Indian Board for 
Media  Services  consisting  of  a  chairperson  and  six  other  Members,  whereas, 
clause 6 provides for the salary and allowances payable to them.  Clause 8 of the 
Bill  provides  for  the  salary  and  allowances  of  the  officers  and  staff  appointed  to 
the Board.  Clause 13 of the Bill provides that the Central Government, shall after 
due  appropriation  made  by  Parliament  by  law  in  this  behalf,  grant  such  sums  of 
money to the Board, as it may think fit for carrying out the purposes of this Act. 

Therefore, the Bill, if enacted, would involve expenditure both of recurring 
and non-recurring nature from the Consolidated Fund of India. However, it is not 
possible at present to estimate the exact expenditure likely to be involved.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING DELEGATED LEGISLATION 

Clause 17 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules and 
regulations  for  carrying  out  the  purposes  of  the  Bill.  Clause  16  of  the  Bill 
empowers  the  Central  Government  to  make  an  order  or  give  such  direction  to 
remove  any  difficulty  which  might  arise  in  giving  effect  to  the  provisions  of  the 
Act.  As  the rules, regulations,  orders  or directions  will relate  to  matters of  detail 
only, the delegation of legislative power is of a normal character.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 

The objective of a law is fully achieved when it adapts with the changes required 
over  the  passage  of  time.  This  year  marks  twelve  years  of  the  Protection  of  Children 
from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, which became the first comprehensive law 
of  the  country  against  child  sexual  abuse.  The  examination  of  POSCO  by  Courts, 
child  experts,  children  organizations,  and  other  stakeholders  have  brought  out  a 
series of recommendations to be included in the Act  to  increase  its  relevance.  Since 
then,  POCSO  Act,  2012  has  undergone amendments  in  the  year  2019  and  the  new 
POCSO  Rules,  2020  have  been  implemented  in  2020.  However,  there  are  many 
more  important  reforms  that need to be included in the Act to keep pace with the recent 
amendments to child-related  legislation  and  the  evolving  child  rights  policies.  The 
ambiguities surrounding certain provisions in the Act need to be addressed through clear 
and  concise  provisions.  While  the  Rules,  2020  cover  many  procedural  aspects  of 
dealing with the victim and their case, there need to be strict provisions provided under 
the Act for complete and effective implementation. 

  There  are  certain  ambiguities  surrounding  the  manner  in  which  heads  of 
educational institutions or teachers or any other personnel dealing with children in such 
institutions  have  to  report  the  offence  and  deal  with  the  complaint  under  the  POCSO 
Act, 2012. In many cases,  the Court has been of the view that the onus of late reporting 
or non-reporting cannot fall on the shoulders of the heads of educational institutions or 
teachers and that they need to be given training in matters relating to implementation of 
the various provisions of the Act  so that they  are  equipped  to  verify  the  facts  before 
they  lodge a complaint under this Act.  

Another  important  aspect  of  this  law  that  poses  serious  ambiguity  is  about 
providing  compensation  to  victims.  A  well-stated  procedure  is  what  is lacking in the 
existing  legislation  and  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  State  and  the  authorities 
need  to  be  clearly  defined.  There  is  a  need  for  a  well-established procedure to be 
entailed and followed by all levels of authorities so that  the  victims  are  able  to  get 
their  right  to  compensation  and  access  to compensation.  The  amendment  brought 
out  in  this  Bill  provides  for  a  clear procedure that helps in understanding the steps to 
award  compensation  as  well  as 
to  create 
mechanisms  for  tracking  the  process  of  awarding  and  payment  of  the  compensation. 
This  will  help  the  victims  in  getting  compensation  in  a  timely  manner  and  curb  the 
existing delays in victim compensation delivery.  

imposes  a  duty  on 

the  authorities 

This  Amendment  Bill  proposes  changes  to  the  law  which  are  victim-centric 
and  friendly.  The  amendments  are  an  endeavor  to  overcome  the  existing  ambiguities 
and  help  in  making  the  implementation  process  more  transparent and  helpful  for  the 
victims  as  well  as  for  the  institutions  working  towards  implementation  of  the 
provisions of this Act. 

Hence, this Bill.
