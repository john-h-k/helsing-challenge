Whereas, since the goal of global polio eradication was set in 
1988, polio incidence has been reduced by more than 99.9 percent through the use of the inactivated polio vac-cine developed by Jonas Salk and the oral polio vaccine developed by Albert Sabin; 
Whereas the Americas were the first region to be certified 
free from wild poliovirus in 1994, with the last case of wild poliovirus in the Americas confirmed in Peru in 1991; 
Whereas, since 1994, 4 other regions of the world have been 
certified free from wild poliovirus and 2 of the 3 strains of wild poliovirus have been certified eradicated world-wide; 
Whereas, as of September 2024, only Afghanistan and Paki-
stan have been unable to fully stop transmission of wild poliovirus, a decrease from more than 125 countries in 1988; 
Whereas the GPEI reaches the world’s most vulnerable chil-

Whereas today, according to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, an estimated 20,000,000 people are walking who have been spared from paralysis and 1,500,000 deaths have been averted worldwide thanks to the efforts of the GPEI;

Whereas the GPEI effectively reaches children to protect

Whereas countries long considered polio-free, including the

Whereas, in 1944, Fred Korematsu appealed his case to the 
United States Supreme Court, which ruled against him, declaring in Korematsu v. United States that Japanese incarceration was a ‘‘military necessity’’ rather than an egregious act of racial discrimination; 
Whereas, in 1980, President Jimmy Carter created the Com-
mission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civil-ians (CWRIC), which concluded in 1983 that the forced removal and imprisonment of people of Japanese ancestry was motivated by ‘‘race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership’’;

fend the liberties of Muslim people when, in 2003, he warned in an amicus brief that the United States ex-treme national security measures following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were reminiscent of the mistakes of the past that undermined American civil lib-erties, including the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War, the prosecution of dissenters during World War I, the Red Scare of 1919–1920, the interment of people of Japanese descent during World War II, and the era of loyalty oaths and McCarthyism during the Cold War; 
Whereas the democratic character of the American people will

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister 9
of Defense Yoav Gallant and should be condemned 10

Whereas fraternal benefit societies represent a successful,

Whereas fraternal benefit societies operate under a chapter 
system, creating a nationwide infrastructure, combined with local energy and knowledge, which positions fra-ternal benefit societies to most efficiently address unmet needs in communities, many of which the government cannot address; 
Whereas the fraternal benefit society model represents one of 
the largest member-volunteer networks in the United States, with approximately 7,000,000 people belonging to local chapters across the country; 
Whereas research has shown that the value of the work of 
fraternal benefit societies to society averages more than $3,800,000,000 per year, accounting for charitable giv-ing, educational programs, and volunteer activities, as well as important social capital that strengthens the fab-ric, safety, and quality of life in thousands of local com-munities in the United States;

Expressing support for the designation of January 30, 2025, 
as CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and RHI (repeated head impacts) Awareness Day. 
Whereas chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, is a pro-
gressive degenerative brain disease which appears in per-sons with a history of repeated head injury sustained over a period of years; 
Whereas, after decades of advancement in research related to 
repeated head injuries, in October 2022, the National In-stitutes of Health (NIH) formally acknowledged that there is a causal link between repeated blows to the head and CTE; 
Whereas repetitive head impacts (RHI) have been shown to 
cause damage to the white matter in developing brains;

•HRES 72 IH Whereas researchers have found that in brains with CTE, 
there is buildup of an abnormal protein, tau, in the brain leading to brain atrophy; 
Whereas tau buildup is also found in Alzheimer’s disease and 
other forms of dementia, and people with CTE may show signs of another neurodegenerative disease, including Alz-heimer’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Lewy body disease (LBD), and Parkinson’s disease; 
Whereas the risk of developing CTE is greatest with athletes 
and military veterans, who frequently endure repeated subconcussive blows to the head from playing contact sports or suffer traumatic injury from military training or blasting, but it has also appeared in survivors of do-mestic abuse and those with epilepsy; 
Whereas symptoms associated with CTE and RHI, such as 
memory loss, tremors, addiction, progressive dementia, depression, suicidal thoughts, impaired judgment, and paranoia, most often are present years or decades after the brain trauma or hits stop, but have been found in a patient as young as 17 years old; 
Whereas, currently, CTE can only be definitively diagnosed 
after death through postmortem neuropathological anal-ysis; 
Whereas advocacy organizations, health care providers, and 
institutional researchers are dedicated to studying the causes and symptoms of CTE in order to enable parents and families to make informed decisions regarding the best interests of their children in youth sports and to de-velop an earlier diagnostic tool so patients may address these symptoms as early as possible; and

Awareness Day; 3

advance the study of CTE (chronic traumatic 5

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that— 
(1) human activity has been the dominant cause of 
observed climate change over the past century; 
(2) human-caused climate change has led to wide-
spread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere; 
(3) vulnerable communities that have historically 
contributed the least to human-caused climate change are disproportionately affected by its impacts; 
(4) adverse impact from human-caused climate 
change will continue to intensify; 
(5) continued emissions will further impact all com-
ponents of the climate system, and changes in weather and climate extremes will become larger; 
(6) in the near term, global warming is more likely 
than not to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius even under low greenhouse gas emission scenarios; 
(7) economic damages from climate change are 
present in climate-exposed sectors like agriculture, for-estry, fishery, energy, and tourism; 
(8) global temperatures must be kept below 1.5 de-
grees Celsius above pre-industrialized levels to avoid the most severe impacts of a changing climate; 
(9) limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius 
will require rapid, deep, and immediate greenhouse gas emission reductions; and 
(10) deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation and adap-
tation measures between 2020 and 2030 would help to reduce loss and damage for humans and ecosystems;

•SCON 6 IS with a common purpose to collectively provide charitable 
and other beneficial activities for society; 
Whereas fraternal benefit societies operate under a chapter 
system, creating a nationwide infrastructure, combined with local energy and knowledge, which positions fra-ternal benefit societies to most efficiently address unmet needs in communities, many of which the government cannot address; 
Whereas the fraternal benefit society model represents one of 
the largest member-volunteer networks in the United States, with approximately 7,000,000 people belonging to local chapters across the country; 
Whereas research has shown that the value of the work of 
fraternal benefit societies to society averages more than $3,800,000,000 per year, accounting for charitable giv-ing, educational programs, and volunteer activities, as well as important social capital that strengthens the fab-ric, safety, and quality of life in thousands of local com-munities in the United States; 
Whereas, in 1909, Congress recognized the value of fraternal 
benefit societies and exempted those organizations from taxation, as later codified in section 501(c)(8) of the In-ternal Revenue Code of 1986; 
Whereas fraternal benefit societies have adapted since 1909 
to better serve the evolving needs of their members and the public; 
Whereas the efforts of fraternal benefit societies to help peo-
ple of the United States save money and be financially secure relieves pressure on government safety net pro-grams; and

RESOLUTION 
Reaffirming the freedom to decide and expressing continued 
support for medication abortion access. 
Whereas antiabortion extremists are desperate to ban abor-

Whereas there is a settled understanding of the Comstock 
Act for nearly a century, and the Department of Justice, the courts, and Congress have made clear that the Com-stock laws do not apply to lawful abortions; 
Whereas the majority of the public supports abortion access, 
and an overwhelming majority of Americans (80 percent) oppose a Federal law banning abortion nationwide;

ductive rights, including the ability to make personal, pri-vate health care decisions; 
Whereas misusing, misapplying, and misinterpreting the 
Comstock Act would be yet another attempt to attack ac-cess to medication abortion, a safe and effective health care option; 
Whereas misusing, misapplying, and misinterpreting the 
Comstock Act could threaten certain shipping and trans-portation of basic medical materials; and 
Whereas misusing, misapplying, and misinterpreting the 
Comstock Act could further threaten and endanger sex-ual and reproductive health: Now, therefore, be it

Whereas CRNAs are the primary providers of anesthesia care

Whereas CRNAs practice in every setting in which anesthesia 
is delivered, including traditional hospital surgical suites and obstetrical delivery rooms, the offices of dentists, po-diatrists, ophthalmologists, and plastic surgeons, ambula-tory surgical centers, and United States Military and Public Health Services and Department of Veterans Af-fairs medical facilities; and

Calling on the Government of Panama to expel officials and 
interests of the People’s Republic of China and terminate Chinese management of key Panamanian ports. 
Whereas the strategic location of the Panama Canal is vital 
to global trade and the security of the Western Hemi-sphere; 
Whereas Panamanians and Americans have invested signifi-
cantly to secure the sovereignty, stability, and prosperity of Panama, including the construction, defense, and transfer of the Panama Canal, ensuring it remains a crit-ical asset for global commerce;

approximately $375,000,000, equivalent to more than $10,000,000,000 in 2025, with thousands of workers los-ing their lives due to disease and hazardous conditions; 
Whereas the defense and operation of the Panama Canal dur-
ing the 20th century further demonstrated the United States’ commitment, at significant financial and human cost, to maintaining the vital global trade route; 
Whereas the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality 
and Operation of the Panama Canal, signed at Wash-ington September 7, 1977 (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Neutrality Treaty’’), prohibits actions that undermine the canal’s neutrality or threaten United States security interests and grants the United States the right to act, unilaterally if necessary, to defend the canal’s neutrality and ensure its operational security; 
Whereas the Neutrality Treaty obligates Panama and the 
United States to act against any threat to the neutrality or peaceful operation of the Panama Canal, including undue foreign control over its infrastructure or manage-ment; 
Whereas when President Carter ratified the Neutrality Trea-
ty, President Carter accepted a legally binding condition to the Treaty, adopted by the United States Senate, es-tablishing an independent right of the United States to intervene militarily, consistent with United States con-stitutional processes, to reopen or restore the operations of the Panama Canal, as the United States deems nec-essary, to ensure the canal remains open, neutral, secure, and accessible;

enterprises and Chinese government-affiliated private en-tities, has expanded its influence with key infrastructure projects and ports around the world, including in Pan-ama, raising concerns about undue leverage and potential threats to free and fair navigation and trade; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China Belt and Road Ini-
tiative fosters economic dependence and exerts outsized geopolitical influence through its investments; 
Whereas Panama joined the Belt and Road Initiative in De-
cember 2018; 
Whereas the involvement of Chinese government-affiliated en-
terprises in the construction, management, and mainte-nance of other critical infrastructure, such as a proposed fourth bridge spanning the Panama Canal, calls into question the ability of Panama and the United States to defend the canal’s neutrality and ensure its operational security; 
Whereas two major ports in Panama, the ports of Balboa and 
Cristobal, are currently managed by Chinese-affiliated en-tities, such as Hutchison Ports, a Hong Kong-based op-erator with significant ties to China’s economic and polit-ical ecosystem, threatening the sovereignty of Panama and the security of the Western Hemisphere; 
Whereas the involvement of officials from the People’s Re-
public of China and entities that are subject to the Na-tional Security Law of the People’s Republic of China and similar laws in Panamanian ports and infrastructure compromises international security and disrupts critical trade routes;

Congress finds the following: 5
(1) Congress in 2021 unanimously passed, and 6
the President signed, Public Law 117–80 (40 U.S.C. 7
8903 note), which authorized the National Medal of 8
Honor Museum Foundation to establish on Federal 9
land in the District of Columbia a commemorative 10
work to honor the acts of valor, selfless service, and 11
sacrifice displayed by Medal of Honor recipients. 12
(2) The Medal of Honor was established by 13
President Abraham Lincoln and first awarded 160 14
years ago on March 25, 1863, and is part of Lin- 15
coln’s lasting and living legacy. 16
(3) In 1991, during the administration of Presi- 17
dent George H.W. Bush, this legacy was extended 18
further when National Medal of Honor Day was es- 19
tablished as March 25th of each year. 20
(4) The Medal of Honor is awarded to all 21
branches of the United States Armed Forces as our 22
nation’s highest recognition for valor in combat. 23

rifices and inspire future generations. 2
(6) Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams, the last World 3
War II Medal of Honor recipient, passed away in 4
2022 and laid in honor at the United States Capitol. 5
(7) The Medal of Honor represents the very 6
best of our Nation—ordinary citizens, who took ex- 7
traordinary action above and beyond the call of duty 8
and became heroes of our Republic. 9
(8) These examples inspire all citizens and ig- 10
nite within us the very spirit of America. 11
(9) The Medal of Honor rises to the level of su- 12
preme national and historical importance necessary 13
to warrant representation on the National Mall. 14

Whereas LGBTQIA+ community spaces include and uplift

Whereas the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Defamation League, later 
known as GLAAD, held its first meeting in 1985 at the New York Community Center, convening over 400 LGBTQIA+ people and providing an unprecedented op-portunity for members within the LBGTQIA+ commu-nity to openly and unabashedly discuss ongoing political and social issues facing the LGBTQIA+ community;

Whereas the New York City Anti-Violence Project’s

virtually all postsecondary institutions as recipients of Federal financial assistance; 
Whereas there are fundamental and enduring biological dif-
ferences between males and females that put females at a competitive disadvantage in sports and jeopardize their safety during competition against males; 
Whereas, in 2010, the National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion unilaterally adopted a policy that enables biological males to participate on women’s rosters and compete in the women’s sports category, a policy that continues today; 
Whereas the policy described in the previous proviso dis-
proportionately negatively impacts female athletes; 
Whereas the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics 
(referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘NAIA’’) has insti-tuted new policies to protect biological women in sports and ensure that only student athletes whose biological sex is female will be allowed to compete on NAIA-sponsored women’s sports teams; 
Whereas it is imperative that opportunities for collegiate 
women to compete athletically are protected on the basis of sex; and

Whereas esteemed Tamil literary works, including the 
‘‘Thirukkural’’, ‘‘Tholkappiyam’’, ‘‘Aganaanuru’’, ‘‘Puranaanuru’’, ‘‘Silappatikaram’’, and ‘‘Manimegalai’’, embody enduring values that inspire Tamil culture and enrich global heritage; 
Whereas these literary works can be read and interpreted by 
modern-day Tamil people, have been translated into more than 100 languages, and their values remain relevant to contemporary life; 
Whereas recognizing January as ‘‘Tamil Language and Her-

Deeming certain conduct of members of Antifa as domestic terrorism and

RESOLUTION 
Deeming certain conduct of members of Antifa as domestic 
terrorism and designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. 
Whereas the extremist organization Antifa is motivated by 
communism, anarchism, socialism, and violence, and has continuously demonstrated their commitment to lawless-ness and criminal behavior; 
Whereas, in 2016, the Department of Homeland Security for-
mally classified Antifa activities as ‘‘domestic terrorist vi-olence’’; 
Whereas one chapter, Rose City Antifa, has rejected the civil 
treatment of perceived enemies, stating, ‘‘We can’t just argue against them; we have to prevent them from orga-nizing by any means necessary.’’, and this same chapter

•HRES 26 IH publicly stated, ‘‘We are unapologetic about the reality 
that fighting fascism at points requires physical mili-tancy.’’; 
Whereas the far-left militant organization held signs reading, 
‘‘We are ungovernable’’ and ‘‘Abolish ICE, no cops, pris-ons, borders, presidents’’, illustrating their dedication to lawlessness; 
Whereas, in response to the 2017 violent riots, an Antifa ex-
tremist stated, ‘‘Sometimes you have to use direct action to stop it because protesting, signs, yelling is not going to do anything. You have to make them afraid.’’; 
Whereas Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Chris-
topher Wray stated in a testimony to the House Home-land Security Committee, ‘‘We have seen folks who sub-scribe or identify with the Antifa movement, who coalesce regionally into small groups or nodes and they are cer-tainly organized at that level’’, proving these extreme, violent attacks, disguised under the name of protests, are coordinated, organized events that are orchestrated by Antifa; 
Whereas the Congressional Research Service reports that 
Antifa literature urges followers to publicize information such as home addresses, phone numbers, photographs, and social media profiles of perceived enemies; 
Whereas, in June 2018, at least 1,500 U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (referred to in this resolution as ‘‘ICE’’) employees were doxed by an Antifa-linked Twit-ter account and were subjected to violent threats and harassments;

•HRES 26 IH Whereas, in February 2017, black-bloc, Antifa-affiliated riots 
resulted in $100,000 worth of damage at the University of California at Berkeley; 
Whereas, in February 2017, over 200 rioters were indicted on 
charges of assaulting police officers, torching a limousine, and smashing windows of several businesses, and other Antifa-affiliated rioters were armed with hammers, crow-bars, bricks, rocks, flares, firecrackers, and other explo-sive devices; 
Whereas, in August 2017, approximately 100 Antifa rioters 
incited violence during a peaceful rally in Berkeley, Cali-fornia, where these terrorists were repeatedly punching and kicking innocent people, sending several peaceful protestors to the hospital, and ultimately 13 rioters were arrested on a range of charges including assault with deadly weapons and obstructing a police officer; 
Whereas, in July 2020, a self-proclaimed member of Antifa, 
Willem Van Spronsen, tossed lit objects at vehicles and buildings, caused a car fire, attempted to ignite a 500- gallon propane tank, and attempted to firebomb the ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Washington; 
Whereas, in February 2021, the United States Attorney for 
the District of Oregon stated that Antifa caused more than $2,300,000 in riot damage to Federal property in Oregon, not including any damages to private businesses or State, county, and city buildings; 
Whereas, over the summer of 2020, Antifa assisted in inflict-
ing over $2,000,000,000 in damages against churches, Federal buildings, businesses, and other downtown struc-tures across 20 States, resulting in the death of at least 30 individuals as well as 700 injured police officers;

•HRES 26 IH Whereas, over the summer and fall of 2020, Portland District 
Attorney Mike Schmidt refused to file charges in approxi-mately 70 percent of the approximate 1,000 protest- and riot-related cases brought by police officers; 
Whereas, in May 2020, the Department of Justice formally 
labeled Antifa violence as domestic terrorism in a public statement saying, ‘‘The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated ac-cordingly.’’; 
Whereas Black Lives Matter-Antifa rioter Malik Fard Mu-
hammad was sentenced to 10 years in Federal prison for ‘‘repeatedly and intentionally jeopardizing the lives of po-lice officers, destroying public property, and encouraging others to commit violence during protests that occurred in Portland in 2020’’; 
Whereas, in January 2021, Portland Police Bureau officials 
reported that Antifa rioters attacked officers in down-town Portland shooting commercial-grade, aerial fire-works and firebombs, and destroying government prop-erty and over a dozen downtown businesses; 
Whereas in that same riot, police were also attacked with 
bricks, rocks, and frozen water bottles, and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler reported at least tens of thousands of dollars in damage had been done; 
Whereas, in August 2022, Antifa ardently defended the 
sexualization of children by guarding a ‘‘kid-friendly’’ drag show at a North Texas distillery; 
Whereas, in January 2023, Atlanta police arrested 6 extrem-
ists on charges of domestic terrorism following violent riots carried out by members of Antifa who shattered

vandalized the walls of the city; 
Whereas, in January 2023, Antifa issued a statement telling 
its followers to bring pipes, spray paint, kerosene, and lighters to New York City to ‘‘Burn it all down’’; 
Whereas, in March 2023, Antifa-affiliated rioters set fire to 
the future Atlanta police training facility by launching fireworks, Molotov cocktails, and other destructive items at police officers and into the facility’s construction site resulting in arrests of 23 extremists on charges of domes-tic terrorism; 
Whereas these coordinated, destructive acts of hate carried 
out by Antifa are attacks against the Nation’s law en-forcement as well as the American people and have no place in the United States; and 
Whereas members of Antifa are relentlessly dedicated to 
using acts of domestic terrorism in order to suppress op-posing political ideologies: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 1
(1) this conduct of Antifa members, or any un- 2
lawful conduct performed at an Antifa-affiliated 3

(as such term is defined in section 2331 of title 18, 5

Texas, Mr. C OLLINS , Mr. C RANE , Ms. M ALLIOTAKIS , Mr. M OYLAN , Mr.

RESOLUTION 
Expunging the January 13, 2021, impeachment of President 
Donald John Trump. 
Whereas the Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ and that the President ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’; 
Whereas, on January 13, 2021, the House of Representatives 
passed H. Res. 24, Agreeing to Article I of the Resolu-tion Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high Crimes and Misdemeanors, by a vote of 232 Yeas, 197 Nays, and 4 Not Voting;

•HRES 25 IH Whereas Article I of the Resolution, entitled ‘‘Incitement of 
Insurrection’’, contains a subjective account of that which transpired at the Capitol on January 6, 2021; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution omits any discussion of 
the circumstances, unusual voting patterns, and voting anomalies of the 2020 Presidential election itself; 
Whereas prior to considering and voting on the Impeachment 
Resolution, Democratic leadership in the House made no effort to understand the rationale behind the widespread mistrust harbored by American voters in the wake of the 2020 Presidential election; 
Whereas President Trump won 18 of the 19 bellwether coun-
ties across the country that have predicted the winner of every Presidential election since 1980; 
Whereas President Trump received approximately 10,100,000 
more votes than in the 2016 Presidential election, mak-ing President Trump the first incumbent President in 132 years, since Grover Cleveland’s failed bid for reelec-tion in 1888, to have increased his vote from his initial election and seemingly still not won reelection in the sub-sequent cycle; 
Whereas Secretaries of State and State boards of election 
across the country changed State election laws sua sponte in the name of ‘‘health and safety’’ in the wake of the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas public officials in numerous States issued guidance 
to counties that local election officials were precluded from performing on-the-spot signature analysis, ensuring absentee ballots could not be rejected because an election official believed the voter’s signature on a ballot envelope did not match the signature on file;

•HRES 25 IH Whereas four Democratic lawmakers (Senators Warren, Klo-
buchar, Wyden, and Representative Pocan), formerly en-thusiastic proponents of voting machine integrity, went so far as to send a 2019 letter to voting system companies, providing real examples of voting machine problems (such as switching votes, rejecting paper ballots, vulnerability to cyberattack) yet, following the 2020 Presidential elec-tion, any individual who raised the same concerns was dismissed by Democrats and pundits in the mainstream media as spreading ‘‘misinformation’’ and as being noth-ing more than a ‘‘conspiracy theorist’’; 
Whereas recount efforts following the 2020 Presidential elec-
tion were vociferously opposed by Governors and Secre-taries of State in key swing States like Arizona, Pennsyl-vania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia; 
Whereas public officials in key swing States ignored, and 
took great steps to resist, calls for accountability and transparency in election administration and the counting and recounting of ballots in their respective States, fur-ther sowing the seed of doubt in the electorate as to the legitimacy and fairness in the final result; 
Whereas rather than setting forth facts and evidence sup-
porting the need to impeach a President a matter of days before he leaves office, Article I of the Resolution cites two quotes from President Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech on the Ellipse that lack any context, and are viewed in a light most unfavorable to the President; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution grasps at the fact that 
President Trump stated ‘‘we won this election, and we won it by a landslide’’, as well as ‘‘if you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore’’, as un-deniable evidence that ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’

•HRES 25 IH were committed, and that President Trump engaged in 
‘‘insurrection or rebellion against the United States’’; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution conveniently fails to men-
tion the fact that President Trump explicitly stated, ‘‘I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard’’; 
Whereas the consideration of the Resolution by the House of 
Representatives failed to follow any meaningful legislative process whatsoever; 
Whereas not a single evidentiary hearing on the Resolution 
was held, no witnesses were heard, and no process or op-portunity to respond was provided to President Trump; 
Whereas no Members of Congress were provided an oppor-
tunity to review or amend the Resolution before it came before the full House of Representatives for consider-ation; 
Whereas the Committee on Rules of the House of Represent-
atives is the only committee that published an official Committee Report for the Resolution, that being the Re-port accompanying H. Res. 41, the rule providing for floor consideration of the Resolution; 
Whereas, while a ‘‘Majority Staff Report’’ was released by 
Democrats on the House Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee did not issue an official Committee Report, via regular order, for H. Res. 24, the Resolution itself; 
Whereas failing to issue a Committee Report for H. Res. 24 
conveniently precluded House Judiciary Committee Re-publicans a forum in which they may have showcased their dissenting views on the Resolution;

•HRES 25 IH Whereas to assert that a lone Committee Report accom-
panying a procedural rule for floor consideration provided sufficient due process to the Trump administration or the American people via their elected representatives, and to assert that voting Yea on the Resolution was justified, runs contrary to the Oath of Office taken by all Members of the House of Representatives; 
Whereas neither the Committee Report issued by the Com-
mittee on Rules of the House of Representatives, nor the text of the Impeachment Resolution itself, contain any mention of the text of section 3 of article I of the Con-stitution, which provides that ‘‘Judgment in Cases of Im-peachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office’’; 
Whereas a plain reading of the text of section 3 of article I 
of the Constitution demonstrates that an official tried, and convicted, in the Senate must first occupy the ‘‘Of-fice’’ from which he is to be removed, let alone forever be disqualified from ‘‘hold[ing] any office . . . under the United States’’; 
Whereas in frantically passing the Impeachment Resolution 
on January 13, 2021, only 2 days after it was introduced in a frenzy of hysteria, House Democrats, and 10 House Republicans, left the Senate only one week to conduct a complete trial and convict President Trump before he left office; 
Whereas doing so left the Senate virtually no chance to com-
port with section 3 of article I of the Constitution; 
Whereas unsurprisingly, 31 days passed before the Senate 
held a vote and failed to convict President Trump, 23 days after he had left office; and

•HRES 25 IH Whereas as further indication of the partisan political motiva-
tions behind the Resolution, once the Article of Impeach-ment was passed by the House of Representatives and transmitted to the Senate, the Chief Justice of the Su-preme Court refused to serve as the presiding officer for the trial, as required by section 3 of article I of the Con-stitution, and instead the Senate President pro tempore, Senator Pat Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, and a re-liably partisan politician, served as the presiding officer, perfecting the entirety of the process as nothing more than an unconstitutional exercise in futility, moot, and fantastical political theater: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the January 13, 2021, impeachment 1
of President Donald John Trump is expunged, as if such 2
article had never passed the full House of Representatives, 3
as the facts and circumstances upon which such article 4
was based met the burden of proving neither that Presi-5
dent Trump committed ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’, 6
as set forth in section 4 of article II of the Constitution, 7
nor that President Trump engaged in ‘‘insurrection or re-8
bellion against the United States’’, such that he is forever 9
precluded from ‘‘hold[ing] any office . . . under the 10
United States’’ pursuant to section 3 of the 14th Amend-11
ment to the Constitution. 12

Recognizing the 125th anniversary of organized Okinawan

Whereas, on January 8, 1900, 26 contract laborers from the

Whereas the first Okinawan to arrive in the United States 
was Mr. Keizo Kawatsu, who arrived in the United States in 1889 through Vancouver, Canada, passing through Los Angeles, California, before settling in Phoe-nix, Arizona;

Whereas, during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945,

lowing the Second World War, Okinawan Americans gathered donations and worked with the United States military to deliver shipments of clothes, medicine, school supplies, and livestock to Okinawa;

Ms. M ALLIOTAKIS (for herself, Mr. B ILIRAKIS , Mr. P APPAS , and Ms. T ITUS) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Parthenon Marbles should be returned to Greece. 
Whereas the Parthenon was built on the hill of the Acropolis 
in Athens, Greece, in the mid-fifth century B.C. under the direction of the Athenian statesman Pericles and the design of the sculptor Phidias; 
Whereas the Parthenon is the ultimate expression of the ar-
tistic genius of Greece, the preeminent symbol of the Greek cultural heritage, including its art, architecture, and democracy, and of the contributions that modern Greeks and their forefathers have made to civilization; 
Whereas the Parthenon has served as a place of worship for 
ancient Greeks, Christians, and Muslims;

•HRES 18 IH Whereas the Parthenon has been adopted by imitation by the 
United States in many preeminent public buildings, in-cluding the Lincoln Memorial; 
Whereas over 100 pieces of the Parthenon’s sculptures, now 
known as the Parthenon Marbles, were removed from the Parthenon under questionable circumstances between 1801 and 1816 by British nobleman Thomas Bruce, sev-enth Earl of Elgin, while Greece was still under Ottoman rule; 
Whereas the removal of the Parthenon Marbles, including 
their perilous voyage to Great Britain and their careless storage there for many years, greatly endangered the Marbles; 
Whereas the Parthenon Marbles were removed to grace the 
private home of Lord Elgin, who transferred the Marbles to the British Museum only after severe personal eco-nomic misfortunes; 
Whereas the sculptures of the Parthenon were designed as an 
integral part of the structure of the Parthenon temple, the carvings of the friezes, pediments, and metopes are not merely statuary, movable decorative art, but are inte-gral arts of the Parthenon, which can best be appreciated if all the Parthenon Marbles are reunified; 
Whereas the Parthenon is a universal symbol of culture, de-
mocracy, and freedom, making the Parthenon Marbles of concern not only to Greece but to all the world; 
Whereas, since obtaining independence in 1830, Greece has 
sought the return of the Parthenon Marbles; 
Whereas the return of the Parthenon Marbles would be a 
profound demonstration by the United Kingdom of its

•HRES 18 IH appreciation and respect for the Parthenon and classical 
art; 
Whereas returning the Parthenon Marbles to Greece would be 
a gesture of good will on the part of the British Par-liament, and would set no legal precedent, nor in any other way affect the ownership or disposition of other ob-jects in museums in the United States or around the world; 
Whereas the United Kingdom should return the Parthenon 
Marbles in recognition that the Parthenon is part of the cultural heritage of the entire world and, as such, should be made whole; 
Whereas Greece would provide care for the Parthenon Mar-
bles equal or superior to the care provided by the British Museum, especially considering the irreparable harm caused by attempts by the museum to remove the original color and patina of the Marbles with abrasive cleaners; 
Whereas Greece opened the New Acropolis Museum in 2009 
which houses the Marbles that were not removed to the United Kingdom by Lord Elgin and displays them along-side plaster replicas of the Marbles currently in the Brit-ish Museum so visitors can see the entire frieze as it was designed around the Temple of Athena; 
Whereas it has been 200 years since the British Government 
voted to purchase the Marbles; 
Whereas the Greek Government has publicly supported work-
ing with the British Government in a diplomatic manner to negotiate mutually agreeable conditions for the return of the Parthenon Marbles; 
Whereas the people of Greece have a greater, ancient bond 
to the Parthenon Marbles, which were in Greece for over

Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep- 1

necessitates aggression toward Cyprus; 
Whereas the Government of Turkey ordered its military to in-

Whereas the Government of Turkey has tolerated or abetted 
the desecration of more than 500 Orthodox Christian churches and religious sites in the territory of the Repub-lic of Cyprus that the Turkish military occupies; 
Whereas the Government of Turkey has brought in over 
200,000 illegal settlers into the occupied area of Cyprus to change the sociopolitical and demographic fabric of the area, in violation of the Geneva Conventions; 
Whereas Turkey is a member state of the European Court

Ms. P EREZ (for herself and Mr. G OLDEN of Maine) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules 
RESOLUTION 
Establishing the Select Committee on Electoral Reform. 
Whereas approval of Congress is unacceptably low, and this 
disapproval is in part caused by the structure of Con-gress and how it is elected; 
Whereas Americans are increasingly turning to electoral re-
form to improve their experience of politics and elections, including by adopting proportional representation, ranked choice voting, open primaries, and various redistricting reform measures; 
Whereas article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the United 
States gives Congress the power to enact laws governing the time, place, and manner of elections for Senators and Members of the House of Representatives; 
Whereas the law commonly known as the Uniform Congres-
sional District Act, passed in 1967, requires every State

Whereas Article II of the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (hereinafter the ‘‘Genocide Convention’’), approved and opened for signa-ture in 1948 and entered into force in 1951, defines genocide as ‘‘any of the following acts committed with in-tent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the

Whereas substantial and significant evidence documenting 
widespread, systematic actions against the Ukrainian people committed by Russian Forces under the direction of Russian Federation political leadership meets one or more of the criteria under Article II of the Genocide Con-vention, including— 
(1) killing members of the Ukrainian people in mass 
atrocities through deliberate and regularized murders of fleeing civilians and civilians in passing as well as pur-poseful targeting of homes, schools, hospitals, shelters, and other residential and civilian areas; 
(2) causing serious bodily or mental harm to the 
Ukrainian people by launching indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian areas, conducting willful strikes on humanitarian evacuation corridors, and em-ploying widespread and systematic sexual violence against Ukrainian civilians, including women, children, and men; 
(3) deliberately inflicting upon the Ukrainian people 
conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part, including displacement due to annihilated villages, towns, and cities left devoid of food, water, shelter, electricity, and other basic neces-sities, starvation caused by the destruction of farmlands and agricultural equipment, the placing of Russian land-mines across thousands of acres of useable fields, and blocking the delivery of humanitarian food aid;

(5) forcibly mass transferring millions of Ukrainian 
civilians, hundreds of thousands of whom are children, to Russia or Russian Federation-controlled territories; 
Whereas the Russian Federation’s State-level intent in favor 
of these heinous crimes against humanity has been dem-onstrated through frequent pronouncements and other forms of official communication denying Ukrainian na-tionhood and sovereignty, including President Putin’s ahistorical claims that Ukraine is part of a ‘‘single whole’’ Russian nation with ‘‘no historical basis’’ for being an independent country; 
Whereas some Russian soldiers and brigades accused of com-
mitting war crimes in Bucha and elsewhere were re-warded with medals by President Putin; 
Whereas the Russian State-owned media outlet RIA Novosti’s 
published the article ‘‘What Should Russia do with Ukraine’’ which outlines ‘‘de-Nazification’’ as meaning ‘‘de-Ukrainianization’’ or the destruction of Ukraine; 
Whereas Article I of the Genocide Convention confirms ‘‘that 
genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they un-dertake to prevent and to punish’’; and

descendants were enslaved in the United States and 10
colonies that became the United States from 1619 to 11
1865; 12
(2) the institution of slavery was constitu- 13
tionally and statutorily sanctioned by the Govern- 14
ment of the United States from 1789 through 1865; 15
(3) the slavery that flourished in the United 16
States constituted an immoral and inhumane depri- 17
vation of Africans’ life, liberty, African citizenship 18
rights, and cultural heritage, and denied them the 19
fruits of their own labor; 20
(4) a preponderance of scholarly, legal, commu- 21
nity evidentiary documentation and popular culture 22
markers constitute the basis for inquiry into the on- 23
going effects of the institution of slavery and its leg- 24

RESOLUTION 
Reaffirming the House of Representatives’s commitment to 
ensuring secure elections throughout the United States by recognizing that the presentation of valid photograph identification is a fundamental component of secure elec-tions. 
Whereas elections allow United States citizens to empower 
their fellow citizens to be their voice in the constitutional republic; 
Whereas the operation of free and fair elections is vital to 
Americans’ trust in government; 
Whereas countries that hold elections without very basic secu-
rity measures eventually lose the support of their people and erode faith in elections and the rule of law;

Whereas United States citizens are required by law to present

Whereas United States citizens are required by law to present

Whereas United States citizens possess no greater commodity 
than the franchise, and understand that protection of the security of voting and elections is crucial for the mainte-nance of the Republic and its way of life: Now, therefore, be it
