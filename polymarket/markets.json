Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nA Cabinet position is defined as any of the heads of the 15 executive departments or a role formally designated as Cabinet-level by the President.

Similarly, announcements from the nominee, Trump or one of his representatives that the nominee will be withdrawn will qualify for this market.\n\nA candidate who fails a senate confirmation vote will not be considered to have been withdrawn until their withdrawal has been announced or another candidate has been named instead. For example, if Hegseth fails a confirmation vote, but is later appointed through a recess appointment, this would not count as Hegseth withdrawing. However, if Hegseth were to fail a confirmation vote and then was withdrawn and replaced with another nominee, this would qualify as Hegseth withdrawing. \n\nIf a candidate has not officially assumed the role they were nominated for by June 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, they will be considered to have been withdrawn. \n\nThis market will resolve to \"No\" as soon as all relevant positions are filled without meeting the conditions for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.",

If no statement is released by the end date of the next scheduled meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No change\" bracket.",

Non-violent actions, such as warning shots, artillery fire into uninhabited areas, the deployment of balloons, audio broadcasts, or missile launches that land in territorial waters or pass through airspace, will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. Intentional ship ramming that results in significant damage to (e.g., a hole in the hull) or the sinking of a military ship by another will count toward a \"Yes\" resolution, however minor damage (scrapes, dents) will not.\n\nNote: South Korea's Coast Guard Administration (CGA) is not part of the military.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.",

Non-violent actions, such as use of water cannons, warning shots, artillery fire into uninhabited areas, or missile launches that land in territorial waters or pass through airspace, will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution.

Hand-to-hand combat with the use of melee weapons between military personnel, will qualify. For example the 2020 Galwan Valley clash and the 2022 Yangtse clash would both count.\n\nNon-violent actions, such as warning shots, artillery fire into uninhabited areas, or missile launches that land in territorial waters or pass through airspace, will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. Intentional ship ramming that results in significant damage to (e.g., a hole in the hull) or the sinking of a military ship by another will count toward a \"Yes\" resolution, however minor damage (scrapes, dents) will not.\n\nNote: the China Coast Guard (CCG) is part of the military, however the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) is not.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.",
