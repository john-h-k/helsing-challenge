Big blue butterflies swoop among the ferns. The people walking the paths of this open-air museum seem a little dazed, as if overawed by the conjunction of contemporary art and natural beauty, both on a grand scale.\n\nOutside international art-world circles, mention of Inhotim (pronounced \u201cin-yo-cheem\u201d) tends to elicit puzzled looks.\u00a0Founded in 2002, about 200 miles north of Rio, for the first few years of its existence it was essentially the private paradise of its creator, mining magnate and art collector Bernardo de Mello Paz. When, in 2006, the gates of the estate were thrown open to the public, the first visitors found a huge botanic garden that was also a repository of top-drawer modern art.\n\nToday 140 hectares are open to visitors, containing some 560 artworks in 24 galleries as well as outdoors among dense tropical woodlands buzzing with wildlife. There\u2019s a strong showing from Brazilian artists such as Cildo Meireles, Adriana Varej\u00e3o and H\u00e9lio Oiticica; international names include Olafur Eliasson, Yayoi Kusama, Zhang Huan and Doug Aitken.\n\nInhotim\u2019s comparative remoteness in Brazil\u2019s interior, beside the small town of Brumadinho in Minas Gerais state, helped imbue visitors with a sense of being on an artistic adventure but also presented a logistical problem. There were no standout hotels in Brumadinho, meaning many visitors tried to tackle the whole museum in a single day \u2014 an impossible task \u2014 before making the long drive back to Belo Horizonte, the state capital.\n\nThe game-changer is Clara Arte, a hotel inside the grounds, which opened in December \u2014 at least a decade behind the original schedule. It stands in a forest clearing, its low-slung structures hugging a gentle slope with a view of wooded hills. Forty-six individual units, or bangal\u00f3s, some of them perched on stilts, are laid out along paved tracks, each with an outside deck looking out into the canopy. There\u2019s an occasional whoop of a distant train horn echoing romantically through the woods, but the sense of seclusion is palpable.\n\nIf I\u2019d somehow imagined the hotel would be a solemnly chic \u201cboutique\u201d suitable only for serious art-lovers, this was not quite that. In some ways Clara Arte is an unusual creature: elegantly designed yet family-friendly; all-inclusive (you even wear the bracelet, which doubles as a room key) yet with a whiff of exclusivity.\n\nWhat\u2019s not so surprising is the artistic connection. Works of art adorn the public areas of the hotel and an informal \u201cart talk\u201d is held every evening in the piano bar, fuelled by champagne and big bowls of popcorn.\u00a0The tiles of the indoor swimming pool were designed by Brazilian artist Jos\u00e9 Patr\u00edcio, and even the children\u2019s playroom has immersive murals by C\u00e1ssio Vasconcellos.\u00a0\u201cI wanted a place that kids could enjoy as much as their parents,\u201d confirms Taiza Krueder, owner of Clara Resorts, a small independent hotel group with two existing properties, both in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cI didn\u2019t see why this had to be either a hip design hotel or a water park.\u201d\n\nAn early decision was to hire S\u00e3o Paulo-based designer Marina Linhares, who had done interiors at Clara\u2019s Ibi\u00fana hotel as well as those of Krueder\u2019s own S\u00e3o Paulo home. (It helped that Linhares was already a big Inhotim fan, visiting the museum up to four times a year.) Any suggestion of a rustic jungle lodge is banished by her design for the bangal\u00f3s, which channels Brazilian mid-century modernism (the curvaceous forms, the omnipresence of wood) with her usual neutral colours and natural fibres \u2014 indeed, this richly textured minimalism seems almost too sleekly urbane for the sylvan surroundings of Inhotim.\n\nTwo further picks were Leo Paix\u00e3o, Minas Gerais\u2019 most celebrated chef, whom Krueder tapped for a culinary concept embracing both traditional mineiro cooking and modern Brazilian cuisine, and Gabriel Sodr\u00e9, a talented young mineiro formerly at the helm of Michelin-starred Chispa Bistr\u00f3 in Madrid. Currently getting to grips with the complexities of a kitchen operation that includes a charcoal grill, a wood-fired pizza oven and a buffet offering up to 18 dishes at any one time, Sodr\u00e9 plans to add a gastronomic restaurant showcasing his personal brand of Japanese-Brazilian fusion.\n\nOn the first morning of my visit, earlier this month, the hotel breathes a languid, loose-limbed holiday vibe. Children frolic in the infinity pool or gather in groups around enthusiastic young monitors while their parents top up their tans. Tudo bem? (everything OK?), the universal Brazilian greeting, is the morning mantra among the guests, who pad around in flip-flops (the universal Brazilian footwear) and baggy shorts.\n\nI wonder: are these well-to-do paulistanos here for the art, or for a stress-busting vacation at a bijou upscale resort? Krueder estimates that 75 per cent of clients are regulars at her other two properties, but trusts they\u2019ll tear themselves away from Clara Arte\u2019s wraparound comforts to venture into the wonderland on their doorstep.\n\nThey\u2019d certainly be foolish not to. From the hotel a stone path leads through the woods and into the park as it were by the back door. Guests enjoy free entry even on Mondays and Tuesdays when Inhotim is closed to the general public. Guided tours are laid on for adults and, in a tailor-made educational version, also for children.\n\nWhat with restaurants and snack bars, a design store, drinking fountains at intervals along the paths and a fleet of electric buggies ferrying visitors between the galleries, Inhotim provides a complete day out, yet the entrance fee is a modest R$60 (about \u00a38). The park has an upper limit of 5,000 visitors per day, but its great size means it almost never feels busy.\n\nJunio Cesar, a full-time guide who was born and grew up on the original hacienda, leads the way, reeling off some of Inhotim\u2019s impressive statistics: more than 500 employees including 84 gardeners, 15km of paths, about 100 bird species, more than 4,300 varieties of plant. The 24 galleries run the gamut of architectural styles, from concrete bunker and tiled-roof farm building to photographer Miguel Rio Branco\u2019s rusted-steel hangar evoking the grim hulk of a slave ship.\n\nTheir contents range from installation and sculpture to video and photography, and quality is uniformly high \u2014 any of these galleries would be standouts even in a big-city context. Highlights for me include Matthew Barney\u2019s monstrous tractor, a powerful argument against deforestation, and Claudia Andujar\u2019s stunning photographs of Amazonian tribes. Then there are the site-specific open-air pieces: turn a corner and you might stumble on a Dan Graham plate-glass room, a concatenation of steel girders by Cildo Meireles, or the giant kaleidoscope that is Olafur Eliasson\u2019s \u201cViewing machine\u201d.\n\nPaz had long dreamt of a hotel within the park, and in 2011 he broke ground with a design by veteran Brazilian architect Freusa Zechmeister.\u00a0Though the hotel was slated to open in 2014, building work came to a halt that year. (Official statements at the time blamed the shutdown on \u201creassigning financial resources to other areas of Inhotim\u201d.) In 2017 Paz was arrested for money-laundering and sentenced to nine years in jail. He would be acquitted on appeal three years later but in 2019 the collapse of an iron-ore tailings dam in nearby Brumadinho left around 270 dead, directly affecting many of the families of Inhotim workers. And then came the pandemic.\n\nIt must have seemed the stars were misaligned for Paz and his passion project, but all has come right in the end. A new airport is due to open by 2027 in the industrial town of Betim, just a 45-minute drive away, which will surely increase footfall. Inhotim seems likely to join the colonial towns of Ouro Preto and Tiradentes as a permanent fixture on visitor routes around Minas Gerais.\n\nNow run as a public institute rather than a private museum and overseen by a board of trustees, the park is supported by corporate sponsorship, individual donations and membership. Paz has stepped back from the front line, ceding most of his collection to the institute but keeping part of it for a brand new space within the park, the Instituto Bernardo Paz (due to open later this year).\n\nA discreet, mildly eccentric gentleman in his seventies who avoids talking to the press, he can be glimpsed from time to time, a bohemian figure with a mop of white hair, in the bar of the new hotel, or strolling the museum\u2019s forest paths. By all accounts he is satisfied with what he sees. And honestly, who can blame him?\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1925c2a6-c098-4614-96b5-3d65a0f7b345"}}, {"id": "e1a7cd2e-1bb8-4a8d-9824-11fcb7c0821c", "event_name": "\u2018Brasil!

In 1928, the year that Tarsila do Amaral (known simply as Tarsila) painted stylised forms dancing around a glassy pool in \u201cLake\u201d, Brazilian modern art came of age. Her magical realist landscape is the poster image for the Royal Academy\u2019s upbeat winter tonic of an exhibition Brasil! Brasil! The Birth of Modernism, presenting 10 artists from two generations, born 1880s-1920s.\n\nIt feels like summer in here.\u00a0Lasar Segall\u2019s hot jungle landscape \u201cBoy with Geckos\u201d (1924),\u00a0Alfredo Volpi\u2019s fluttering street banners \u201cFa\u00e7ade\u201d (1963) and \u201cFlags and Poles\u201d, Candido Portinari\u2019s ghostly buskers spinning a slum dwelling into luminous cubes \u201cFavela with Musicians\u201d (1957),\u00a0are typical of the paintings, spanning cubist-influenced figuration to abstraction, beaming warmth, light and\u00a0wit. The show, arranged as individual artist displays, introduces some of Latin America\u2019s most exuberant painters, and is lightly curated, refreshingly free of politics and jargon even though it hinges on a postcolonial narrative.\n\nIn different ways, each artist pondered the question posed by Tarsila\u2019s husband, the poet Oswald de Andrade, in his 1928 \u201cCannibal Manifesto\u201d, demanding his countrymen gobble up European art to spit out something freshly, authentically Brazilian. \u201cTupi or not Tupi?\u201d Andrade asked: could a mesti\u00e7o nation throw off colonialism and create a culture built on heritages of Tupi-speaking indigenous people, African ancestry brought by slavery, and Portuguese settlers, fused with the excitement of Europe\u2019s avant-garde?\n\nAndrade\u2019s friend Anita Malfatti painted \u201cPortrait of Oswald\u201d (1925), the poet as a spiky firebrand whom you might meet in a prewar Berlin caf\u00e9. He glowers at the show\u2019s entrance, declaring\u00a0Malfatti as the pioneer who, after studying in Germany, brought expressionism to S\u00e3o Paulo in 1916 with \u201cMan of Seven Colours\u201d, a yellow-green-purple figure growing out of jungle vegetation.\n\nTarsila, a coffee heiress born in 1886, two years before Brazil abolished slavery, was bolder. She took off for Paris in 1920 and returned to paint the seminal nude \u201cBlack Woman\u201d (1923) \u2014 exaggerated thick lips shooting off the face, a single drooping breast,\u00a0simplified heavy body, showing the impact of her teacher Fernand L\u00e9ger. The preliminary sketch is displayed here.\u00a0The model was one of Tarsila\u2019s servants, and today it reads as racist distortion; in fact it was emancipatory, claiming Afro-Brazilian identity for a new national art defying colonialist academicism.\n\nEuropean experience was indispensable, but transformed as it hit Brazilian soil. Tarsila\u2019s \u201cFavela Hill\u201d (1924) applies L\u00e9ger\u2019s chunky forms, bright hues and flat perspective to depict a Rio shanty town peopled by confident, jaunty Black figures. Segall\u2019s \u201cBanana Plantation\u201d (1927) is a cubist banana plantation whose flickering, fractured leaves frame the face of a Brazilian labourer resembling an African mask \u2014 the sort of \u201cprimitivist\u201d sculptures that had mesmerised the artists with whom Segall trained in Dresden. \u201cBananal\u201d, bought by S\u00e3o Paulo city in 1928, was the first modernist painting purchased by the Brazilian state.\n\nLithuanian immigrant Segall arrived in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1923, brimming with hope. \u201cI saw myself transported under a dazzling sun, whose rays illuminated the people and objects,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything seemed to give the impression of radiating pulses of light. I saw purple earth, brick-red earth, almost black earth, a luxurious vegetation overflowing in fantastic decorative forms.\u201d\u00a0\u201cLight Reflecting in the Forest\u201d (1954), its vertical stripes of subtle colour modulations piercing the dark depths to hint at mysterious pulsing forms among the dense Campos do Jord\u00e3o pines, vibrates like an abstract metallic sculpture swaying in the wind.\n\nTropical tropes underpin modern expression in myriad unexpected ways. Portinari the social realist \u2014 \u201cI am a son of the red earth. I decided to paint the Brazilian reality, naked and crude as it is\u201d \u2014 simplifies landscape and figures into a kind of grotesquerie. \u201cCoffee Agricultural Worker\u201d (1934) is a giant with oversized feet and hands, statuesque in a stark ochre-black landscape, \u201cMigrants\u201d (1944) a frieze of macabre skeletal figures circled by vultures.\n\nFl\u00e1vio de Carvalho painted \u201cOur Lady of Desire\u201d (1955), a fashionista in striped blouse and pleated skirt deconstructed into multihued abstract shapes; then, decked in a similar costume he called \u201cNew Look\u201d, he paraded through S\u00e3o Paulo for his bizarre performance \u201cExperi\u00eancia N 3\u201d. A photograph shows this protest at gendered and colonial norms of European attire. Carvalho is the show\u2019s anarchist; his biomorphic forms twisted into animal-human figures dotted with large piercing eyes \u2014 \u201cAncestral Portrait\u201d, \u201cChrist\u2019s Final Ascension\u201d (both 1932) \u2014 are as gloriously weird as Mir\u00f3\u2019s and Dal\u00ed\u2019s inventions.\n\nNot for nearly a decade \u2014 since Painting the Modern Garden in 2016 \u2014 have Burlington House\u2019s sumptuous main galleries looked as resplendent and eye-popping as now.\u00a0Although quality of work varies \u2014 Djanira\u2019s formulaic folk pictures are the low point \u2014\u00a0a strong theatrical design of yellow, pink or azure walls, big funky geometric-shaped seats, and deco graphics helps disparate strands cohere. As in the garden show, the broad optimistic theme is growth and renewal, and the power of cultural roots.\n\nThe abstract artists especially look far back. Vicente do Rego Monteiro\u2019s \u201cIndigenous Composition\u201d (1922) imitates designs from precolonial Marajoara ceramics. Rubem Valentim transforms symbols of Afro-Brazilian Candombl\u00e9 deities into the language of geometric abstraction in his monumental totem series \u201cEmblems\u201d and \u201cEmblematic Objects\u201d.\n\nThe show ends with Geraldo de Barros\u2019s shimmering photographic abstractions:\u00a0his \u201cFotoforma\u201d series (1946-51) uses multiple exposures, rotated images, beautiful arabesques \u2014 \u201cAbstraction (S\u00e3o Paulo)\u201d (1949), \u201cUntitled, Pampulha, Belo Horizonte\u201d (1951), an abstraction of an Oscar Niemeyer project \u2014 to chronicle Brazil\u2019s exponential urbanisation. Barros is the link to Brazil\u2019s future \u2014 Lygia Clark and H\u00e9lio Oiticica\u2019s arte concreto, beyond the scope here \u2014 although still the human element leaps out in his work. Reminiscent of Klee\u2019s visages, \u201cHomenagem a Paul Klee\u201d (1949) is a face formed by over-painting the holes, abrasions and scores on a negative depicting an old cemetery wall.\n\nBrasil! Brasil! arrives in London from Bern\u2019s Zentrum Paul Klee, and also commemorates the RA\u2019s 1944 Exhibition of Modern Brazilian Paintings, a wartime diplomatic venture that sparked little curiosity.\u00a0Brazilian modernism remains unfamiliar, although that is changing: this show rides a wave of recent global interest, kick-started by MoMA\u2019s 2018 Tarsila retrospective, and consolidated by Adriano Pedrosa\u2019s excellent display at last year\u2019s Venice Biennale.\n\nThe movement\u2019s themes of hybridity and metamorphosis appeal today, as do its powerful female artists. Women have rarely pioneered art revolutions, but Malfatti\u2019s and particularly Tarsila\u2019s leading roles are incontrovertible \u2014 Tarsila\u2019s surreal figure \u201cAbaporu\u201d (1928, \u201cman who eats human flesh\u201d in Tupi; not in the show) sparked Andrade\u2019s landmark \u201cCannibal Manifesto\u201d. Tarsila\u2019s current touring exhibition (Paris then Bilbao) deprives the RA of key works, but still her visionary paintings sing and surprise, like so much in this joyous exhibition.\n\nTo April 21, royalacademy.org.uk\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/66655a6b-178d-4f63-ada1-d14e3b4afecf"}}, {"id": "0e60b8a6-c35c-41ae-8c5d-6236df41f7bc", "event_name": "Brazilian airline merger would boost aviation sector, says Azul boss ", "blurb": "John Rodgerson defends potential tie-up with rival Gol despite concerns about competition and ticket pricing", "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0", "body": "The boss of Brazilian airline Azul has argued that its planned merger with rival Gol to create the country\u2019s largest carrier will strengthen Brazil\u2019s aviation industry and expand the number of routes on offer.\n\nChief executive John Rodgerson defended the tie-up as bolstering a sector still grappling with the financial fallout of the Covid-19 crisis, saying it would drive efficiencies and benefit consumers.\n\nAzul-Gol would control about 60 per cent of the domestic market, giving rise to concerns about the potential impact on competition and ticket prices. But Rodgerson described it as a \u201cmerger of growth\u201d that could increase the number of destinations served by Azul from 150 to 200.\n\n\u201cWe can strengthen our balance sheet and connect a lot more people,\u201d the American businessman told the Financial Times. \u201c[It is an] opportunity to grow and to add more cities to the map, add more [flight] frequencies.\u201d\n\nHe added that the deal, which will require regulatory approval, could even lower ticket prices in certain markets, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to get more capacity up in the air\u201d.\n\nThe proposed tie-up follows a difficult period for Latin America\u2019s airlines. They received little direct financial assistance from governments during the pandemic, in contrast to the billions of dollars showered on US and European peers, leading many to skirt or fall into bankruptcy.\n\nBrazilian carriers also complain that the country\u2019s expensive jet fuel prices and widespread passenger lawsuits push up costs and fares.\n\nGol filed for bankruptcy last year, and is seeking $1.9bn of financing in order to exit Chapter 11 proceedings in the US, while Azul has struck out-of-court agreements with creditors to reduce its liabilities and unlock new funds. Latam Airlines, the region\u2019s largest group, emerged from bankruptcy protection in late-2022.Azul and Abra, Gol\u2019s majority shareholder, signed a memorandum of understanding this month, agreeing to combine the companies into a single entity but continue to operate both brands separately.\n\nShares in the two groups have rallied, though they remain at a fraction of pre-coronavirus levels.\n\nThe new Azul-Gol would have combined annual revenues of some R$37bn ($6.2bn), based on 2023 figures, along with an overall net debt of about R$52bn, according to the latest filings. Rodgerson said it should have a reduced cost of capital and benefit from joint procurement.\n\nBoth airlines were given a boost this month when the government agreed to significant discounts on outstanding tax liabilities.\n\nIndustry watchers believe antitrust watchdogs may force the enlarged entity to cede landing slots at popular airports in order to obtain regulatory approval\n\nFounded in 2008, Azul challenged the Latam-Gol dominance with a focus on smaller cities not served by other airlines. Rodgerson said the merging companies\u2019 routes only overlapped by 10 per cent, adding that higher levels of market concentration were found in the UK, France, Canada, Korea, Germany and Chile.\n\nThe CEO suggested regulators could be appeased through \u201cremedies of growth\u201d, with extra flights added to certain locations.\n\nThe government of leftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, which wants to make air travel more affordable and has pledged to support carriers, appears to be favourable.\n\nIts ports and airports minister suggested ticket prices would not rise following the merger, which he said fell into a wider global trend of airline consolidation.\n\nRodgerson said he had discussed the idea of a merger last year with Lula. \u201cI think he totally understood the logic [and] that we are a massive customer of Embraer,\u201d the CEO said, referring to the Brazilian plane maker. \u201c[Lula] wants to see more people travel. And so in that sense, our objectives are totally aligned.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rodgerson said that, regardless of the merger, ticket prices would need to rise in the short term following a slump in the Brazilian real, which has further pushed up the costs of kerosene and spare parts priced in dollars. These pressures have led Azul to close a dozen routes for the first time.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/53220372-a15a-4174-bb8b-e5c927dd079e"}}, {"id": "d6fc7fcc-11b6-44b4-9fd2-6f8d2bb8c76a", "event_name": "Botafogo\u2019s transformation sets bar for Brazilian football investment ", "blurb": "Rio club\u2019s successes highlight commercial changes under way in nation\u2019s domestic game", "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0", "body": "There is an old saying in Brazilian football: \u201cSome things only happen to Botafogo.\u201d\n\nOnce a nod to the Rio de Janeiro team\u2019s apparent bad luck, it has taken on a different meaning after a remarkable turnaround in the club\u2019s fortunes made it a model for investment in the country\u2019s football industry.\n\nBotafogo last month ended an almost 30-year wait to be crowned national champions, less than three years after being saved from potential bankruptcy by US businessman John Textor. Days earlier, the side clinched its first Copa Libertadores, the South American equivalent of the Champions League, with a 3-1 victory despite having a player sent off in the first minute.\n\n\u201cJust winning in normal fashion wouldn\u2019t have been anywhere near as fun,\u201d said Textor, whose acquisition was among the first in a wave of Brazilian football takeovers. \u201cPeople are going to look at Botafogo as an example,\u201d he told the Financial Times.\n\nThe team\u2019s newfound glory comes amid a push in Brazil to modernise the business side of its football industry, which has in recent years attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of funding pledges and worldwide attention.\n\nDomestic football in Brazil has long suffered from off-field mismanagement, despite the country\u2019s renowned passion for the sport and reputation as a talent factory.\n\nThe result was financial problems at many clubs, traditionally run as non-profit associations controlled by fans, as well as commercial underdevelopment and the premature exodus of young players overseas.\n\nAfter legislation in 2021 encouraged teams to become limited companies that can sell shares, six of 20 in the top S\u00e9rie A division last season were backed by investors.\n\nRicardo Fort, a sports business consultant, said it was \u201ctoo early to tell whether it will be a widespread success beyond Botafogo. But a lot of these clubs are doing better than before, or are on a path of improvement.\u201d\n\nReformers say the old model often led to poor stewardship by directors with an eye on re-election by fans, preventing long-term planning. The rationale behind the new corporate template, known by its Portuguese acronym SAF, is that an owner brings more responsibility and professional administration.\n\nWhile the financial stakes are low compared with the game in Europe, Brazilian football has drawn some big names. Manchester City proprietor City Football Group, controlled by a member of Abu Dhabi\u2019s ruling family, purchased Esporte Clube Bahia in 2023 and agreed to invest a minimum of R$1bn ($160mn) over 15 years.\u00a0This helped the team qualify for the Libertadores after a 35-year absence.Overall revenues at S\u00e9rie A clubs rose more than a fifth to R$8.8bn in 2023, according to consultancy Convocados. Cesar Grafietti, a partner at the firm, said turnover had risen again last year thanks to sponsorship from sports betting companies, higher ticket sales and the Libertadores prize money, paid in dollars like Botafogo\u2019s $23mn winner\u2019s cheque.\u201cThe SAFs have introduced greater controls, a more corporate vision, with investment in the right places \u2014 technology, scouting, marketing and staff training,\u201d he said.\n\nYet old habits die hard. Grafietti noted how debts among top clubs remained high, totalling R$11.7bn in 2023, with some spending beyond their means.\n\nTextor\u2019s investment in Botafogo was not his first foray into football. With a background in virtual reality and visual effects, he also owns a minority stake in London team Crystal Palace and leads the multiclub group Eagle Football Holdings.The entrepreneur did not pay for his 90 per cent shareholding in Botafogo, but instead committed to invest R$400mn and help pay down borrowings. Revenues were projected to be higher than $100mn for 2024, according to Textor, representing a fivefold jump since the takeover. \u201cWe did that with free and low-price ticketing to bring more people into the stands,\u201d he said. \u201cWednesday night at 9.30 and you\u2019ve got a full house. People see these numbers and they know business is good.\u201d\n\nYet the American has at times courted controversy. He has previously clashed with Brazil\u2019s football authorities after levelling allegations of corruption. Financial concerns have hung over another of his outfits, Olympique Lyonnais, which has lately been pushing to sell players, including to Botafogo, to raise funds.\n\nNot all the recent Brazilian deals have played out well. Miami-based private equity firm 777 Partners purchased Botafogo\u2019s rival Vasco da Gama in 2022, with pledges to pay off R$700mn in debts and invest an equal amount, according to reports. But a court this year seized control from the investment firm, whose sports business empire has unravelled.\n\nNor does SAF answer all issues around governance and management, say experts, with some top clubs unlikely to embrace it. Palmeiras and Flamengo, Brazil\u2019s two most decorated sides, are both credited as well-run associations, while Corinthians has ruled out becoming a company.\n\nLooking ahead, industry figures say the best way to take Brazilian football forward is though a new domestic competition controlled directly by clubs, along the lines of the English Premier League, and sold as a single product to broadcasters.\n\nAs almost all income in Brazilian football is generated domestically, teams need to explore foreign audiences if they want to expand.\u00a0\u201cAt some point they\u2019ll need international revenues to grow,\u201d said the consultant Fort.\n\nBut efforts have foundered.

It\u2019s irrational despondency.\u201d\n\nThe turmoil reflected worries that not enough is being done to tackle a chronic budget deficit, even as finance minister Fernando Haddad rushed to obtain congressional approval for R$70bn (US$11.3bn) in spending cuts before the festive holidays.\n\nEconomists warn that without tougher action, the country\u2019s public debt risks hitting unsustainable levels, with potential negative knock-on effects for inflation, interest rates and, ultimately, growth.\n\n\u201cThe lack of meaningful signals on fiscal moderation has thrown Brazil into crisis mode again,\u201d said Mariano Machado at consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.\n\nThe episode has presented the greatest challenge for Lula, 79, in his third term as leader. During a first stint from 2003-2010, the former metalworker won plaudits for raising living standards, while largely respecting fiscal orthodoxy.\n\nHe returned to the presidency last year promising extra cash for infrastructure, public services and welfare. Unemployment is now at the lowest level since records began and GDP is forecast to expand by a robust 3.4 per cent in 2024.\n\nHowever, sceptics say the performance has been boosted by excessive government stimulus that is storing up problems. Some in the business world disillusioned with the tax-and-spend agenda are drawing parallels with Lula\u2019s handpicked successor as president, Dilma Rousseff, whose policies were widely blamed for contributing to a deep economic slump.\n\nUnder Rousseff, increased expenditure and tax breaks to promote growth caused imbalances that compounded the impact of a global commodities downturn. Brazil\u2019s economy shrank almost 7 per cent between 2014 and 2016, when she was impeached for breaking budget laws.\n\n\u201cWe are repeating the mistake made by Dilma\u2019s government, which led to a significant rise in inflation and the biggest recession in our recent history,\u201d said Solange Srour, director of macroeconomics for Brazil at UBS Global Wealth. \u201cThe result of the current crisis of confidence is one of the lowest investment rates [recorded in official data] and a very high real interest rate.\u201d\n\nLula supporters counter the market turbulence belies an economy in good health, pointing to a reduction in poverty and lower inflation than when he took office.\n\n\u201cThe only thing wrong in this country is the interest rate, which is above 12 per cent,\u201d the president said last weekend, after being discharged from hospital following emergency surgery for a brain bleed.\n\nThe leftwinger has long accused the central bank\u2019s high borrowing costs as a drag on growth.\n\nFrom January 1, the central bank will have a new governor chosen by Lula \u2014 former deputy finance minister Gabriel Gal\u00edpolo, 42. His appointment has raised questions about central bank independence at a sensitive moment for the institution.\n\nWith inflation above a targeted upper limit of 4.5 per cent, the central bank raised its Selic benchmark by 100 basis points this month. Two further increases of the same magnitude are set for early next year.\n\nMembers of the government, meanwhile, play down concerns the economy is running too hot.\n\nGuilherme Mello, a high-ranking figure in the finance ministry, acknowledged this year\u2019s GDP forecast was slightly above the economy\u2019s potential, but said overheating will be avoided if a predicted slowdown to 2 per cent in 2025 proves correct.\n\n\u201cFiscal stimulus fell significantly in 2024 and it will be even less in the next two years,\u201d he added. \u201cInflation would have been lower if not for climate events like floods and drought. Next year a much better harvest is forecast, therefore a moderation of growth in food prices.\u201d\n\nOfficials also insisted serious fiscal adjustment is under way, in line with Haddad\u2019s goal to eliminate a primary budget deficit, which discounts for interest payments on existing debts.\n\nMostly funded by increased tax receipts, the shortfall is expected to be about 0.5 per cent in 2024, compared to 2.1 per cent in 2023.\n\nEven so, Brazil\u2019s nominal deficit \u2014 which includes interest payments \u2014 has more than doubled to 9.5 per cent since Lula took office, pushing up public borrowing. Government debt to GDP has risen to 78.6 per cent, relatively high for an emerging nation, and is projected to breach 80 per cent by the end of Lula\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cThis is a very significant level. It creates great uncertainty as to how the debt will be financed,\u201d said Marcos Lisboa, an economist who worked in Lula\u2019s first administration.\n\nGiven more than 90 per cent of Brazil\u2019s budget is allocated to legally mandated items, such as pensions and social benefits, finding major cost savings is very difficult for any government, Lisboa added.\n\nFor now, at least, the exchange rate has stabilised, after the central bank burnt through about $17bn in spot market auctions over a week to support the currency. After breaking the threshold of six to the dollar for the first time last month, the real touched 6.32 in recent days \u2014 an all-time low since being introduced in 1994 \u2014 before recovering to 6.07.\n\nYet it is down one-fifth against the greenback in 2024, adding further inflationary pressures. While even some traders see a market overreaction, members of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party allege financial \u201cspeculation\u201d aimed at undermining the administration.\n\n\u201cThis arm twisting by the market, aided by the central bank, for a hard adjustment in the public accounts is resulting in a negative mood and making the real fall,\u201d the party\u2019s head, Gleisi Hoffmann, told the Financial Times this month. \u201cI believe [the market] has a political plan to make the government unviable.\u201d\n\nFund managers say the currency\u2019s plunge was fuelled by delays in the announcement of long-awaited spending cuts last month, then worsened by a surprise income tax exemption for lower earners unveiled at the same time.\n\nHaddad said the measure would be funded by higher levies on the rich, but critics saw a populist move that damaged the government\u2019s claims of fiscal responsibility.\n\nEven after its extraordinary market interventions, the central bank retains large foreign exchange reserves \u2014 with a stockpile of about $340bn \u2014 providing a buffer against currency shocks.\n\nBut in financial circles there is a growing belief the government will be forced to draw up new austerity proposals to regain investor confidence. Traders say an emergency rate increase by the central bank might also be an option.\n\n\u201cThe market is very pessimistic,\u201d said Leonardo Calixto, co-chief executive of REAG Asset Management. \u201cThere are no signals that this can be resolved in the short term.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella.

The central bank has sold nearly $6bn this week, according to Financial Times calculations based on BCB disclosures.\n\nShortly after the Fed\u2019s decision, the BCB announced yet another planned auction of $3bn for the following day.\n\nThose aggressive dollar sales staved off heavier selling in the real. But investors argued stronger actions were needed to ease anxieties about the public finances of Latin America\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe sell-off is compounding a delicate moment for the leftwing Lula administration, which is attempting to push through cost savings after its tax-and-spend policies provoked mounting resistance in the business world.\n\n\u201cThe market is very concerned regarding [Brazil\u2019s] fiscal accounts and especially the government\u2019s response to it,\u201d said Eduardo Cohn, portfolio manager at Heritage Capital Partners in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThe only way the market has to call the attention of the government is through the [exchange rate].\u201d\n\nWhile emerging market currencies have broadly struggled since Donald Trump\u2019s US election win last month, investors said much of the real\u2019s woes stemmed from worries about rising government spending and debt levels under Lula. The stimulus measures have been a boon to growth but have also contributed to higher levels of inflation and prompted questions about fiscal sustainability.\n\nThe real\u2019s decline this week has taken its year-to-date fall to 23 per cent, making it this year\u2019s worst performer in JPMorgan\u2019s widely followed emerging market currency index. Brazil\u2019s benchmark Bovespa share index has dropped 27 per cent in US dollar terms this year, compared with a 7 per cent rise for MSCI\u2019s broad EM gauge, FactSet data shows.\n\nThe BCB has attempted to ease investors\u2019 nerves and push back against the jolt of inflationary pressure by boosting borrowing costs. The bank lifted its main interest rates by a greater than expected 1 percentage point last week, taking the Selic benchmark to 12.25 per cent.\n\nPolicymakers have signalled further increases of the same magnitude at the bank\u2019s next two rate-setting meetings in 2025. Higher rates may help protect the real by enticing foreign investors, but they will also cool demand across Brazil\u2019s $2.2tn economy, economists say.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to deliver economic pain to slow the economy down and then try to cut rates in 2026, maybe,\u201d said Mark McCormick, head of FX and EM strategy at TD Securities. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be urgency because they have to protect the currency now.\u201d\n\nEd Al-Hussainy, senior rates analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, echoed that sentiment, saying, \u201cthe shorter-term solution is to hike rates much more aggressively\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut even that\u2019s not enough\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Any durable solution needs to be some form of credible commitment to reducing the deficit.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s nominal fiscal deficit is close to 10 per cent of GDP, which mainstream economists say risks pushing public debt to unsustainable levels. A promise by the leftwing government last month to find R$70bn in spending cuts in order to meet its own budget targets also failed to calm traders\u2019 nerves, who saw the parallel announcement of tax breaks for lower earners as undermining the commitment to fiscal discipline.\n\nPaul McNamara, investment director at GAM Investment Management, said the country\u2019s debt level was \u201chigh, but not dangerous\u201d, adding that Brazil\u2019s total borrowings were \u201clower than most G7 countries relative to GDP\u201d.\n\nHowever, he said: \u201cThe problem is that Brazil pays very high real rates to borrow and G7 countries don\u2019t; the sustainable level of debt for Brazil is always going to be a good bit lower.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s fiscal adjustment plans remain uncertain as many of the proposals require Congress\u2019s approval, which breaks for recess after this week. Lula was directly involved in negotiations with lawmakers but has been out of Bras\u00edlia since undergoing emergency surgery to remove a brain bleed last week. He is expected to return to the capital on Thursday.\n\nThe 79-year-old leftist, who previously ruled from 2003-11, returned to power last year on pledges to boost welfare and public works programmes.\n\nThe BCB\u2019s next policy meeting is scheduled for late January. In the interim, McCormick said policymakers could \u201ctry to jawbone the currency\u201d \u2014 using rhetoric to keep the real from sinking further \u2014 and \u201ckeep fighting using market mechanisms\u201d.\n\nAl-Hussainy said the \u201codds are rising\u201d that the central bank would raise rates prior to its next meeting through an extraordinary measure. \u201cThat is probably the most credible way the central bank can come in and shock markets to stabilise the currency.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1c67dc52-4791-4c33-9412-6462b81b8078"}}, {"id": "f7a896be-bf21-42b8-87b6-9b120d5687f1", "event_name": "Which sector will lead the market in 2025?", "blurb": "Plus Brazil\u2019s currency crisis", "date": "2024-12-1800:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. Nissan and Honda are holding merger talks. From an industry and investor point of view, this makes sense. The global car industry is capitally intensive, highly competitive and buffeted by change.

Email us about the best car you\u2019ve ever owned: robert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.\n\nThe new year is approaching, which means that it\u2019s prediction season. In markets, the great majority of predictions are too vague to be interesting, or correct only by chance, or wrong. This makes sense: at its core, the market is already a well-designed prediction machine for corporate performance and economic fundamentals. Seeing that the market has placed the wrong probability on a significant future trend or event is very hard \u2014 the domain of brilliant people operating at the peak of their powers in a fleeting window of market inefficiency.\n\nShould us normals even bother with market predictions, then? Yes, for three reasons. Taking the risk of making a public prediction forces you to test your own assumptions; it is a way of finding out what you really believe. Predictions force you to look closely; they are a way to think about what is already priced in. Finally, and probably most importantly, making a prediction and turning out to be wrong is a great way, possibly the best way, to learn.\n\nUnhedged is celebrating prediction season with a look at stock market sectors. Here is a quilt diagram showing the total return ranking of the 11 S&P 500 sectors over the past two decades (match the colour of the performance figures to the sectors at left; for example, communications, in grey, is the leader so far this year with 45 per cent, followed by info tech in pink and consumer discretionary in purple):\n\nRather than going though the sectors one by one, let\u2019s consider some themes that will be important in 2025, and what they might imply for sectors:\n\nMarket narrowness/megacap dominance: the sectors that won in 2024 won because of a few very big stocks that rose a lot. The communication services sector, for example, was the overall leader only because three huge names \u2014 Alphabet, Meta and Netflix \u2014 now make up almost 80 per cent of the sector market cap, and they all had stellar years. If, as just about every Wall Street strategist predicts, market leadership is going to broaden in 2025, the sector deck is going to be reshuffled.\n\nAI hype: If the AI-will-change-everything narrative loses some shine in \u201825, staying away from the information technology sector is the obvious play: Microsoft, Nvidia and Broadcom make up almost half of the sector weight. A less obvious victim of diminishing AI lustre would be utilities, which have gained 25 per cent this year in large part because of anticipated data centre power demand.\n\nUS & global economic growth: If you think the post-pandemic expansion has legs, stick with the classic cyclicals: financials and industrials. A more contrarian bet would be that global growth, and especially Chinese growth, surprises to the upside, which would help the materials and energy sectors, both of which underperformed massively in 2024.\n\nInflation and rates: The market is pricing in inflation that stays tame, and three Fed rate cuts. What if inflation picks up again and short rates stay high, instead? It depends on the reason: if the inflation results from an overheating economy, energy and financials could do well. If we get stagflation, devil take the hindmost, but staples and healthcare will probably be the foremost, \u00e0 la 2022, while real estate will get hit both coming (demand) and going (rates).\n\nTrump administration policy: If you think Donald Trump can deliver on his promise to cut energy prices by half, you know what to do: sell energy and utilities. Healthcare stocks are already trembling before Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cknock out the drug middlemen\u201d. Those are the pharmacy benefit managers, which are owned by the big insurers. The efforts of Elon Musk and DOGE to cut federal spending may come out of insurers\u2019 and drugmakers\u2019 hides, too.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s promise of deregulation should help finance. Of course, having the CEO and founder of Tesla (which accounts for a fifth of the consumer discretionary sector) in the White House should be good for that company. But surely, after a 90 per cent run since the election, all that is priced in and more?\n\nSo what kind of year does Unhedged predict, and which sectors will lead? We will lay out our thoughts tomorrow. Send us your thoughts today, so we can steal them.\n\nThe Brazilian real hit an all-time low on Tuesday, prompting intervention by its central bank. The culprit: a lack of market confidence in Brazil\u2019s fiscal policy.\n\nBrazil\u2019s deficit has ticked up as a percentage of GDP since President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva re-entered office in early 2023. Investors have balked at his party\u2019s most recent budget proposal, which will reduce the country\u2019s growing annual deficit, but not by much, and will not address rising interest payments. Here is a graph of the deficit as a percentage of GDP, which breaks out net interest payments and annual deficits, courtesy of Robin Brooks at the Brookings Institution:\n\nBond yields have been steadily rising over the year, up to the highs seen in the 2014-2017 economic crisis. Brazilian stocks have come down, but on a much choppier path.\n\nBut what really caught our eye is the cratering real. This is a reflection of the fact that a large portion of Brazil\u2019s debt is in real, and held by local investors. Given that, the government may be tempted to solve their budget problems by meddling with the currency, rather than closing the deficit. Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group, explains:\n\nThe policy rate is currently 12.3 per cent, and inflation is still hovering at 5 per cent. But Lula\u2019s recent remarks, and his unwillingness to budge on the deficit, have given investors reason to believe he might try to undermine central bank independence to shrink the deficit. So they are selling the currency.\n\nEmerging market currency crises play out differently when most of the debt is in dollars \u2014 as investors saw in the 1980s. When a distressed country has to service its debt in dollars, the government must swap its currency for dollars, use the central bank\u2019s dollar reserves, or get an IMF package. In many cases, the market would front-run the government and sell off the EM currency, but in response to higher borrowing costs or reserve depletion \u2014 not to anticipate reckless monetary policy.\n\nIn recent years, more developing countries have been issuing local currency debt. There has been a lot of excitement about the switch, which reduces exposure to US rate policy, supporting EM fiscal stability. But local debt only reduces risk up to a point. If investors don\u2019t like the direction of fiscal policy, and central bank independence is not assured, currencies will still crash.\n\n(Reiter)\n\nHoly humour.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/77081dd8-5d84-432e-97e6-a019870ff688"}}, {"id": "01407a4f-bea1-4f67-a9f6-27884aae2411", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s left forced to consider post-Lula future", "blurb": "Ageing leader\u2019s brain surgery brings to fore the risk of a power vacuum in his party once his political career ends", "date": "2024-12-1500:00:00.0", "body": "For more than 30 years Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has been the standard-bearer of the Brazilian left, forged as a strike leader during the country\u2019s dictatorship and three times elected president of what became Latin America\u2019s largest democracy.\n\nBut a health scare has forced supporters of the 79-year-old to consider what might come after the end of his political career, which has taken a shoeshine boy born in rural poverty to the role of global statesman.\n\nLula, as he is universally known, was rushed from Bras\u00edlia by plane on Monday night to S\u00e3o Paulo for emergency surgery, after an MRI scan revealed a brain bleed caused by a fall at his home in October. After the initial operation, which involved making a small hole into the skull to drain a haematoma, the leftwinger underwent a second, \u201clow risk\u201d procedure on Thursday to prevent further haemorrhages.Doctors said Lula was recovering well, with no cerebral damage. He was discharged on Sunday morning, two days after leaving intensive care. \u201cAs I thought I was healed [after the earlier fall], I confess that I got a bit frightened,\u201d Lula said through tears, wearing a fedora, in a press conference.\n\nStill, the incident has stirred doubts over the physical condition of the divisive politician, who is equally loved and loathed in his homeland \u2014 along with a debate on whether he will, or should, stand for re-election in 2026.\n\n\u201cFor at least the next two years, Brazil will need to deal openly and responsibly with the issue of [Lula\u2019s] health \u2014 and his age,\u201d read an editorial in the Estado de S. Paulo newspaper. \u201cWhat will be at stake is whether Lula has the health and lucidity compatible with the immense challenges ahead of him.\u201d\n\nThe situation has drawn comparisons with US President Joe Biden, 82, who abandoned a re-election bid this year following intense scrutiny over his age and medical fitness. Biden\u2019s incoming successor, 78-year-old Donald Trump, has faced similar questions.\n\nWhile Lula recently told CNN he would only decide on his electoral plans closer to the time, close allies insist he will be on the ticket for his Workers\u2019 party, or PT, in 2026.\n\n\u201cIt was worrying of course, but today Lula is our candidate for 2026. There is no plan B,\u201d Gleisi Hoffmann, PT president, told the Financial Times. \u201cIf we start to think about [alternatives], then it will send out the wrong signal.\n\n\u201cBut clearly, the party has to start preparing, because in 2030 we\u2019re going to need a qualified leader.\u201d\n\nLula inspires deep reverence among his followers but has not cultivated any obvious successors, presenting the risk of a vacuum at the top of the movement he founded in the 1980s. According to party insiders, options include finance minister Fernando Haddad, who lost the 2018 presidential race to far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro, and education minister Camilo Santana. Yet none possess Lula\u2019s popular appeal. Acclaimed internationally for reducing poverty during his first stint in power, from 2003 to 2011, the former metalworker returned last year vowing to boost living standards and save the Amazon rainforest.\n\nIn a survey by Quaest/Genial conducted before Lula\u2019s hospitalisation, more than half of respondents said they believed the president should not run again. However, the poll also found that Lula would defeat rightwing challengers for the presidency.\n\nIn private, senior PT figures are downbeat about the party\u2019s prospects if he is not on the ballot. That reflects the weakened state of Brazil\u2019s left, following a conservative backlash in the wake of corruption controversies and an economic crisis the last time it was in power.\n\nLula\u2019s narrow victory in 2022 over the incumbent Bolsonaro was only thanks to a big-tent coalition backed by moderate voters keen to kick out the brash Christian nationalist.\n\nBruno Carazza, professor at the Dom Cabral Foundation, said past graft scandals had removed potential heirs to Lula.\n\n\u201cThe PT has succession and generational problems,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it has faced many difficulties to get big city mayors and state governors elected in the last decade.\u201d\n\nLula ended his first presidency with record approval ratings. But the country went on to suffer its worst recession under his handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached.In a dramatic downfall, Lula himself was found guilty of money laundering and corruption in 2017 and spent more than a year and a half in jail. The convictions were later overturned, paving the way for his comeback.\n\nSince being admitted for the unplanned surgery, Lula has not taken formal leave from his role nor temporarily transferred the presidency to his deputy, Geraldo Alckmin. He has been in telephone contact with ministers and advisers, according to a person familiar with the matter, who said he was \u201cnot impeded\u201d from carrying out his job.\u201cEvery Brazilian is wondering whether the president is able to govern,\u201d said Adriana Ventura, a lawmaker with the opposition Novo party. \u201cIf he is not, he should let the vice-president govern.\u201dTraditionally on the centre-right, Alckmin belongs to a different party and was once an adversary of Lula, who defeated him in the 2006 presidential election. Selected in a bid to broaden Lula\u2019s appeal, he is considered business-friendly and has served as governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s most populous and richest state.\n\nFollowing Lula\u2019s slip in his bathroom, causing a wound that required several stitches, the head of state had already scaled back a normally busy international travel agenda.\n\nA former smoker and throat cancer survivor fond of physical exercise, Lula had a hip replacement last year. A person close to the president said he was in good health in spite of the latest episode.\n\nThe medical team described the risk of further bleeding as \u201cstatistically negligible\u201d after the follow-up procedure, and recommended rest in the coming weeks.\n\nThey said Lula can resume normal work activities but is to avoid long-haul international flights and exercise, except walking. He should remain in S\u00e3o Paulo until at least Thursday, they said.Eduardo Grin, professor of politics at Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation, said comparisons with Biden were \u201cexaggerated\u201d.\u00a0\u201cMost of the speculation about Lula\u2019s health has come from the financial market, which is opposed to his economic policy.\u201d\n\nThe issue comes at a delicate moment for the government, as investor concerns over Brazil\u2019s public finances and inflation have hammered its exchange rate. Ministers are rushing to obtain parliamentary approval for spending cuts to balance the budget.\n\nA push to eliminate the primary deficit \u2014 meaning before interest payments \u2014 by finance minister Haddad, who many consider the favourite to succeed Lula, has displeased more leftwing PT members who resist austerity.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s decision-making structure is quite concentrated around Lula, especially on economic topics and critical negotiations with Congress. So the timing of his health issue is sensitive,\u201d said Mario Braga, geopolitical analyst at consultancy Rane.\n\n\u201cSince Brazil\u2019s fiscal situation has been the main domestic driver of financial volatility, Lula\u2019s absence in Bras\u00edlia could fuel uncertainty and sour investors\u2019 mood further,\u201d he added.\n\nFor the veteran leftist\u2019s devotees, the episode has brought home his mortality. Denise Forganes, from an industrial suburb of S\u00e3o Paulo where Lula made his name as a trade unionist in the 1970s, said his eventual departure would be a \u201ctragedy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI hope the Workers\u2019 party can come together even without him. There are other possible names. But I don\u2019t have much hope without Lula.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9f5a27a2-a94d-4b4b-b0bd-1c2395f7c6b1"}}, {"id": "8c636fa8-6e1e-4913-bd9c-1ace4e710221", "event_name": "Brazilian president Lula in intensive care after emergency brain surgery", "blurb": "Government says country\u2019s leader is recovering well in S\u00e3o Paulo hospital", "date": "2024-12-1000:00:00.0", "body": "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was in intensive care on Tuesday recovering from emergency surgery to remove a bleed on his brain connected with a fall at home in October.\n\nThe 79-year-old leftwing leader, known as Lula, underwent a craniotomy procedure to drain a haematoma after an MRI scan showed an \u201cintracranial haemorrhage\u201d, according to a medical note shared by his government.Lula was \u201cwell\u201d and being monitored at the S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo after the operation, which was completed without complications, said the medical bulletin. It said the injury was linked to a fall in his bathroom on October 19.\n\nThere was no current expectation that the president would take formal leave from his role, said Brazil\u2019s social communications minister, Paulo Pimenta.Even so, the episode will raise questions about Lula\u2019s state of health and whether he will stand for re-election when Brazil next chooses its president in 2026. Doctors looking after the president told reporters that he was stable, talking and eating following surgery, but would remain in the intensive care unit for the next 48 hours as a precaution. Cardiologist Dr Roberto Kalil said there was no brain damage and that Lula\u2019s neurological functions were intact. \u201cIf all goes well, as it is, he should return to Bras\u00edlia at the beginning of next week,\u201d he added. Lula had sought medical attention in Bras\u00edlia on Monday evening after suffering headaches, then flew to S\u00e3o Paulo at about 10pm for further treatment, an administration official told the Financial Times. He was conscious upon arrival for surgery, according to doctors.\n\nVice-president Geraldo Alckmin will assume Lula\u2019s place on Tuesday at a meeting with Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico in Bras\u00edlia, according to Alckmin\u2019s office. A one-time political foe who Lula defeated in the 2006 presidential election, Alckmin is seen as business-friendly and twice served as governor of S\u00e3o Paulo state. He also heads the ministry of development, industry and trade.\n\nLula, a former metalworker and union leader, was Brazil\u2019s president between 2003 and 2011 and has previously survived cancer. He spent more than a year and a half in jail until 2019 on corruption convictions that were subsequently overturned, opening the door to his political comeback. Lula narrowly defeated hard-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in a 2022 election. Since returning to office for a third term at the start of last year, Lula has had a busy travel agenda. But he skipped a Brics summit\u00a0in Russia following the October accident, which left him requiring several stitches.\n\nHe has made just one international trip since then, travelling to Uruguay last week for a Mercosur summit at which the bloc of South American nations announced a trade deal with the EU. Lula\u2019s surgery comes at a challenging moment for his presidency, as he pursues pledges to raise welfare spending and expand the role of the state in a drive to boost living standards in Latin America\u2019s largest economy. Investors have expressed rising concerns over the administration\u2019s tax-and-spend fiscal policy, despite its promises to eliminate the primary budget deficit, meaning before interest payments.\n\nThe Brazilian real hit an all-time low last month, falling below six to the US dollar, amid worries over the country\u2019s public finances.A police investigation last month claimed that rightwing coup plotters, including elite military personnel, had planned to assassinate Lula, Alckmin and a top supreme court judge before the 2022 transfer of power. However, the alleged scheme was ultimately aborted.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella in Bras\u00edlia", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/56945bd4-9a11-499a-aa2c-2cfd9f31c85b"}}, {"id": "99953fa0-c49b-4fce-9400-4e237fe4f4a9", "event_name": "Brazil judge who battled Elon Musk says social media poses risk to democracy ", "blurb": "Alexandre de Moraes tells FT summit that platforms must be regulated after winning rare victory over X", "date": "2024-12-0500:00:00.0", "body": "The Brazilian Supreme Court judge who won international fame by forcing Elon Musk into a rare retreat has said that democracy is at risk amid a slide into \u201cfascist speech\u201d unless social media platforms are regulated.\n\nAlexandre de Moraes, the shaven-headed justice who blocked Musk\u2019s website X this year until it complied with judicial rulings, said the business model of social media networks had to change because it \u201cdepends on extremism\u201d.\n\n\u201cSocial networks cannot be a lawless land,\u201d de Moraes said at Global Boardroom, the FT\u2019s digital conference. \u201cThe law that applies to the real world must also apply to the virtual one, otherwise we will allow the return of Nazi speech, fascist speech, attacks on democracy and people.\u201d\n\nDe Moraes became a hate figure for Brazil\u2019s hard right movement, receiving death threats after leading a crusade against online extremism and hate speech during the 2022 election, when former president Jair Bolsonaro narrowly lost a re-election bid to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\nA police investigation last month revealed an alleged far-right coup plot to kill Lula following his victory, and found that the judge was also an assassination target of the aborted conspiracy.Supporters of the 55-year-old former prosecutor say he has helped safeguard Latin America\u2019s biggest democracy against a tide of fake news, repeatedly ordering social networks to take down extremist or false posts or face large fines. Opponents accuse him of censorship and unfairly targeting conservatives.\n\n\u201cSocial networks have allowed themselves to be used by extremists, primarily right-wing extremists,\u201d the judge said. \u201cAnd the lack of regulation together with the monetisation of this \u2014 because social networks make money from hate\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009really is a risk to democracy.\n\n\u201c[This] has been used to direct the will of the voter and try to truly brainwash the electorate\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.

Fuck you, Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nOne of Lula\u2019s ministers, Paulo Teixeira, endorsed the insult, posting on X that she had \u201csaid what was stuck in our throats\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009about Elon Musk and his negative interference\u201d.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest man, responded to the first lady\u2019s insult with laughing emojis, adding \u201cthey will lose the next election\u201d, an apparent reference to Lula and his Workers\u2019 party, which will face voters again in 2026.\n\nSpaceSail\u2019s announcement, which comes amid US concerns about its waning influence in a region once considered Washington\u2019s \u201cbackyard\u201d, coincided with a whirlwind diplomatic tour through South America by China\u2019s president.\n\nXi attended the inauguration of a Chinese-built megaport in Peru last week, ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima. He then travelled to Rio for the G20 leaders\u2019 conference before being received in Bras\u00edlia with full state honours on Wednesday.\n\nLula and Xi upgraded their \u201ccomprehensive strategic relationship\u201d \u2014 already one of the highest in Beijing\u2019s hierarchy of bilateral relations \u2014 to a \u201cChina-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet\u201d.\n\nThe agreement echoes one of Xi\u2019s core diplomatic doctrines, building a \u201ccommunity of common destiny for mankind\u201d, which analysts believe refers to Beijing\u2019s pursuit of a multipolar world that will enable its rise while eroding US dominance.\n\nThe two leaders also signed dozens of deals spanning agriculture, trade, infrastructure, technology and industry.\n\nBut Brazil has not joined China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, Xi\u2019s flagship international infrastructure programme, despite being courted by Beijing. Officials in Bras\u00edlia believe they can secure Chinese investments without full membership in the BRI.\n\nSpaceSail, which also operates under the name Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology, has ambitious plans to accelerate its satellite deployment, with a goal of 15,000 spacecraft in low Earth orbit by 2030, according to state media. It launched its first round of 18 satellites in August, followed by another round in October.\n\nOne of its previous international tie-ups in Germany became embroiled in legal disputes over the ownership of prized satellite spectrum licences.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tina Hu in Beijing and Michael Stott in London", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/af680581-9944-40aa-aeeb-30bc6a302aca"}}, {"id": "2979c4e8-f0f8-4da9-a805-617caab49c35", "event_name": "Brazil arrests five military and police officers over alleged plot to kill Lula ", "blurb": "Federal police say group had eyed killings of then president-elect along with his deputy and a supreme court judge", "date": "2024-11-1900:00:00.0", "body": "Brazilian police arrested five people, including military personnel, accused of planning a coup d'\u00e9tat and plot to kill President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, his deputy and a top judge shortly before the leftwinger assumed power.\n\nThe alleged conspiracy targeted the then president-elect and his running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and was to be carried out on December 15 2022, federal police in the capital Bras\u00edlia said on Tuesday.\n\nIt also involved a plan to kidnap and possibly execute supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes, who had been placed under surveillance by the men, according to a document from the court granting arrest warrants.\n\n\u201cInvestigations indicate that the criminal organisation used a high level of technical military knowledge to plan, co-ordinate and execute illegal actions in the months of November and December 2022,\u201d said police.\n\nThe plan aimed to prevent Lula taking office at the start of last year following his October 2022 election victory over incumbent rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro, but was aborted by the plotters before being put into action, the judicial document said.\n\nOf the five people arrested, four were military officers \u2014 including a reserve army general \u2014 and one was from the federal police, Brazil\u2019s equivalent of the FBI. Most of those investigated had special forces training, the police added.\n\nThe arrests mark a significant development in ongoing investigations into alleged attempts to illegally reverse the election of Lula, who previously ruled for two terms between 2003 to 2011.\n\nPolice say the suspects considered poisoning the president-elect as part of a detailed plan codenamed \u201cGreen Yellow Dagger\u201d, an apparent reference to Brazil\u2019s national colours.\n\nThey approved the intrigue in a meeting at the house of Bolsonaro\u2019s defeated running mate, retired general and former defence minister Walter Braga Netto, the supreme court document said. The group allegedly planned to institute a \u201ccrisis cabinet\u201d following the coup, led by a retired army general and Braga Netto. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEarlier this year investigators released documents alleging that military officers and political allies of Bolsonaro, a former army captain, developed a detailed scheme to prevent a handover of power. Bolsonaro is a subject of the wide-ranging investigations. He denies any wrongdoing.\n\nIn the end no coup took place in Latin America\u2019s most populous nation. But days after Lula\u2019s inauguration last year, thousands of radical Bolsonaro supporters ransacked government buildings in Bras\u00edlia on January 8 2023 calling for military intervention to overturn the election result, which they claimed without evidence had been rigged.\n\nMore than 260 of the rioters have been convicted, with many serving custodial sentences.\n\nDe Moraes, the supreme court justice, has become a hate figure for the country\u2019s far-right movement, at the same time as the court itself has been accused by critics of overstepping its powers. Last week a man died after detonating two explosives outside Brazil\u2019s supreme court building.\n\nThe five people arrested over the alleged assassination plot were H\u00e9lio Ferreira Lima, Mario Fernandes, Rafael Martins de Oliveira, Rodrigo Bezerra Azevedo, all former or serving members of the military, and Wladimir Matos Soares, a federal police agent. All remained in custody on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nPolice said the possible crimes under investigation were violent abolition of the democratic state of law, coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and criminal organisation.Agents also executed three search and seizure warrants, as well as 15 other precautionary measures.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ca0b5b60-85db-49fb-b5e4-4a4fe9c7e548"}}, {"id": "28fa8004-c628-4871-9619-ab5ceee852bc", "event_name": "EU and Mercosur miss a trick at Rio summit devoid of trade talks", "blurb": "Also in this newsletter: Italy\u2019s controversial law on surrogacy enters into force", "date": "2024-11-1900:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. As Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine enters its 1,000th day, G20 powers signalled weakening support for Kyiv in a joint statement issued overnight that was stripped of criticisms of Moscow agreed by the same countries a year ago.\n\nToday, I report from Rio de Janeiro on the conspicuous absence of progress on the EU\u2019s much-vaunted Mercosur trade deal, and our Rome bureau chief has a dispatch on Giorgia Meloni\u2019s war on surrogacy going international.\n\nYou might have thought that a meeting of the most powerful leaders of the EU and South America, in Brazil, would be a great moment to make progress on a long-stalled trade deal between the two continents. You\u2019d have been wrong.\n\nContext: The EU has been negotiating a trade deal with the Mercosur group of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia for more than two decades. An agreement would unite a market of 780mn people and save businesses in Europe more than \u20ac4bn annually in tariffs.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s election as US president and his threats to impose sweeping tariffs on imports has given the EU fresh impetus to seal new trade deals. But at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 featuring the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the EU presidents and all Mercosur members \u2014 it barely registered.\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen raised it during her bilateral meeting with Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Sunday, but it was not a topic during the various bilateral meetings and informal chats yesterday, officials briefed on the talks said.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that EU domestic politics has delayed the formal swearing-in of von der Leyen for a second term as commission president, and the installation of her new trade commissioner. Officials yesterday said that was the priority, and that significant progress on the deal would probably only be seen in December.\n\nEU negotiators met their Latin American counterparts in Bras\u00edlia in September, urged on by 11 European capitals to strike a deal that could be put to the bloc\u2019s member states for a vote of approval. Technical discussions were ongoing, officials said.\n\nProponents say that the deal will allow the EU to compete with major Chinese investment, restate the bloc\u2018s free-trade and multilateral principles in the face of Trump\u2019s arrival, and send a message to the incoming president.\n\nThat said, the failure to use the Rio summit to make progress on the deal suits French President Emmanuel Macron, its biggest critic. He believes it will cause environmental damage and subject farmers to unfair competition.\n\nBut if a deal is struck with Mercosur and then put to a vote of EU capitals, a majority can outvote Macron. No surprise, then, that his foreign minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot vented yesterday that the agreement was \u201cunacceptable as it stands, for democratic reasons\u201d.\n\nUS President Joe Biden\u2019s authorisation for Ukraine to launch limited strikes into Russia\u2019s Kursk region using US-made Atacms long-range missiles has upped the pressure on European allies to follow suit.\n\nSurrogacy is now considered a \u201cuniversal crime\u201d in Italy, leaving dozens of couples undergoing the process abroad in anxious limbo, writes Amy Kazmin.\n\nContext: Surrogacy has been illegal in Italy since 2004, punishable by up to two years in prison and fines of up to \u20ac600,000. But Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\u2019s right-wing government is determined to stop Italians from having children via surrogacy even in foreign jurisdictions where the practice is legal.\n\nUnder the harsh new law that came into force yesterday, Italians whose babies are carried by a surrogate anywhere in the world could face up to two years in prison, and fines of up to \u20ac1mn.\n\nBut the fight over the issue isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nLawyers from the Luca Coscioni Association, an organisation that works on human rights issues in medical care and scientific research, have vowed to challenge the law.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to defend all couples damaged by this unjust and unreasonable law,\u201d the association said, vowing to battle in courts to \u201creestablish an opportunity offered by science\u201d.\n\nThe association says it has received pleas for help from around 50 couples at various stages of the surrogacy process, from initial paperwork to collecting reproductive cells or actually awaiting the births.\n\nAmong them are same-sex couples seeking to have children and heterosexual couples where, for instance, the woman can\u2019t carry a child due to serious illness.\n\nMeloni, who believes only heterosexual couples should have children, has in the past targeted LGBT+ families. Her government argues the surrogacy law cracks down on \u201cprocreation tourism\u201d and protects women from exploitation.\n\nWhile the new rules don\u2019t apply retroactively, the fate of families now going through the surrogacy process remains ambiguous.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/26e86942-cb36-42a8-ab30-eb2aa529bc21"}}, {"id": "0a1ee521-fa22-42eb-ad4b-3066167687b7", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s global balancing act is trickier than ever", "blurb": "President Lula has sought to maintain ties with the US, China and Russia.

Having defeated his hard-right rival, Jair Bolsonaro, and won back power after more than a decade out of office, Lula wanted to flag not only his own comeback but his desire to return the South American giant to the global stage.\n\nDuring Lula\u2019s first two terms, and before corruption scandals tarnished his reputation, the former metal worker had been feted as an international star. At one of the first meetings in 2009 of the G20, a body that gave Brazil a rare seat at the top table, then US president Barack Obama dubbed him \u201cthe most popular politician on Earth\u201d. That same year, Brazil also co-founded the Brics bloc of developing nations.\n\nNow Brazil \u2014 and Lula \u2014 are back in the spotlight. On Monday, the president will host the G20 leaders in Rio de Janeiro, one in a series of high-profile international summits to come. Some time next year, Brazil will welcome the newly expanded Brics group of emerging countries, and in November 2025 will also host the annual UN climate conference in the Amazon port of Bel\u00e9m.\n\nLula\u2019s return to centre stage says much about the shifting geopolitics of the era, as growing competition for influence between the US and China gradually overshadows a system of international institutions once dominated by Washington.\n\nThe new environment has opened up space for a group of middle-ranking powers, many of them not formally aligned \u2014 among them Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia and the Gulf states, as well as India, a potential future superpower. Many of these governments are trying to expand their international influence in part by playing off the US, China and in some cases Russia.\n\nBut Brazil\u2019s efforts to take advantage of the changing geopolitical landscape are also facing challenges. Lula\u2019s attempt to act as a regional power and mediate the political crisis in Venezuela has floundered. Brazil, which prides itself on its own transition from dictatorship to democracy, has been uncomfortable at Russia and China\u2019s efforts to make the Brics group more openly anti-western. And the election of Donald Trump in the US is likely to complicate Lula\u2019s plan to showcase its climate diplomacy.\n\nThe country, say analysts, now finds itself having to navigate a much more complicated international scenario, in which its traditional neutrality may come under pressure from all sides. \u201cBrazil is hedging. It\u2019s on the fence,\u201d says Oliver Stuenkel, a foreign policy expert at Brazil\u2019s Getulio Vargas Foundation, of its approach to China and the US.\n\n\u201cBrazil is seeking to implement now this strategy of multi-alignment in a very uncertain global environment,\u201d he adds. \u201cIts major source of power, the capacity to navigate multilateral fora\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is under so much strain now that this strategy of multi-alignment will become more challenging and maybe more costly.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his third term, Lula was facing an uphill struggle. Bolsonaro had allowed Amazon deforestation to soar, mocked coronavirus as a \u201clittle flu\u201d and shunned the international community. Meanwhile, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, his predecessor\u2019s first foreign minister, described climate change as a plot by \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d to weaken the west by helping China.\n\nUpon taking power, Lula defined Brazil\u2019s diplomatic aims afresh \u2014 seeking leadership in global climate diplomacy, reinvigorating his life-long battle against hunger and poverty, and pursuing an end to wars through a posture of engaged non-alignment that attempts to foster co-operation without taking sides.\n\nIn a whirlwind of diplomacy since his inauguration in January 2023, Lula has mended relations with US President Joe Biden, the EU, Africa and China \u2014 all estranged under Bolsonaro \u2014 as well as maintaining ties with Russia and India.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a foreign policy that looks for independence through balance in the world and multipolarity,\u201d says Celso Amorim, a foreign minister in Lula\u2019s previous terms and now his top adviser on international affairs.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t want the world dominated either by one country or by one ideology, or much less by one person.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s well-resourced and professional diplomatic service gives it particular clout, along with its long record of international engagement \u2014 it was a founder member of the League of Nations in 1919 and held the inaugural UN climate summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.\n\nHowever, the country\u2019s posture has at times caused disquiet in Washington and Brussels.\u00a0Lula\u2019s desire to play peacemaker in the Ukraine war irked backers of Kyiv, who accused him of favouring Russia, particularly when he welcomed Putin\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to Bras\u00edlia in April 2023.\n\nEven before his election, the president upset European and American allies of Ukraine by suggesting Kyiv was jointly to blame with Moscow for the conflict. After Lula suggested last year that Washington was prolonging the war by supplying arms to Ukraine, a US National Security Council spokesman accused Bras\u00edlia of \u201cparroting Russian and Chinese propaganda\u201d.\n\nBrazilian diplomats insist that Brazil voted to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine at the UN (India and South Africa abstained), and allies of Lula reject the accusation of one-sidedness. \u201cI\u2019m not justifying what Russia did, I\u2019m critical,\u201d says Amorim. \u201cPresident Lula was critical\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. but to think that you can destroy Russia\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. [is] a dangerous illusion.\u201d\n\nNot everyone buys that argument. Some point to Brazil\u2019s strong economic links to Russia as evidence that Bras\u00edlia is not neutral. Moscow is the biggest supplier of fertiliser to Brazil\u2019s huge agricultural sector, and Brazil has been an eager buyer of cheap Russian diesel, as the west boycotts Moscow\u2019s fuels.\n\nAlthough it may be unpopular in much of the west, Lula\u2019s position on Ukraine is widely shared across the developing world. Nations such as India, China, Mexico and South Africa concur with his view that the US and Europe should be pursuing a diplomatic solution to the conflict, instead of sending ever more powerful weapons to Ukraine and imposing draconian economic sanctions on Moscow.\n\n\u201cOn Ukraine, on other policy issues, whether it\u2019s Middle East, whether it\u2019s dealing with China, Lula has steered Brazil towards largely the same non-aligned policies being pursued by others of the emerging powers in the G20,\u201d says Michael McKinley, a former top state department official and US ambassador to Brazil.\n\nAll these nations are \u201cworking a challenging landscape, [trying] to keep channels open and at the same time pursue their own national interests,\u201d he adds.\n\nIn the same vein, Lula\u2019s comparison of Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza to the Holocaust may have underlined differences with Washington and led the Israeli government to declare him persona non grata. But it is much more in tune with the positions of fellow developing G20 nations such as India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, which has lodged an allegation of genocide against Israel at the UN\u2019s top court.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s ambassador in Brazil praises Lula\u2019s foreign policy platform. \u201cFrom the point of view of South Africa, it\u2019s positive. And for the sake of the [global] south, we should support it,\u201d says Vusumuzi Wellington. \u201cBrazil had disappeared from the global stage. [Now its] standing has improved.\u201d\n\nAt home, however, Lula\u2019s positions have drawn fire from conservative critics who accuse him of losing credibility with Brazil\u2019s traditional partners.\u00a0\u201cThis administration\u2019s position towards conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East has distanced Brazil from the west,\u201d says Marcos Troyjo, a former diplomat nominated by Bolsonaro to head the Brics bank, which he led from 2020 to 2023.\n\nHe argues that the Lula government had abandoned core values and damaged Brazil\u2019s interests \u201cin a rather naive embrace of global south rhetoric\u201d. \u201cThe consequence is Brazil ends up punching below its potential weight,\u201d he adds.\n\nOthers warn against the dangers of excessive ambition. \u201cBrazil is an average regional power,\u201d says Rubens Barbosa, president of the Institute of International Relations and Foreign Trade and former Brazilian ambassador to Washington.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t have the surplus power to influence major issues of war and peace in the world.\u201d\n\nAmorim, Lula\u2019s adviser, counters that \u201cpart of our work is precisely to work against this polarisation, which is bad for the world. It\u2019s bad for China, but it\u2019s also bad for the United States\u201d.\n\nAmong western diplomats there is nonetheless anxiety over the direction Brazil may take. Bras\u00edlia\u2019s proximity to Beijing, by far its largest trading partner, is a particular source of concern.\n\n\u201cWhere is Brazil heading? Is it equidistant, or does it turn to the east?\u201d asks a senior European official. \u201cOur interest is in making democratic partners like Brazil stronger.\u201d\n\nYet Brussels has so far failed to secure ratification of a landmark trade deal between the EU and the Mercosur bloc of South American nations which has been pushed by Bras\u00edlia, a treaty that might serve to lessen Brazil\u2019s dependence on China.\n\nDuring his first stint as president, from 2003 to 2011, Lula deployed the pragmatism honed as a trade union negotiator to build bridges between the developed and developing worlds. He cultivated good working relationships across the political spectrum, from US President George W Bush to the late Venezuelan revolutionary socialist leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nIn a world facing multiple wars and a climate crisis, such skills are, if anything, even more in demand. \u201cTangible results include Brazil\u2019s reintegration into international forums, especially on the climate agenda,\u201d says Fernanda Magnotta, a professor of international relations at the Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nShe cites the country\u2019s selection to host the COP30 summit in Bel\u00e9m and the restoration of the Amazon Fund, which is managed by the state development bank BNDES and finances conservation projects with foreign contributions but was frozen under Bolsonaro.\n\nAlong with India, Brazil has also walked a careful path within the Brics grouping, trying to ensure that it does not turn into an explicitly anti-western bloc. Bras\u00edlia went along reluctantly with Brics\u2019 expansion last year to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the UAE \u2014 a key Chinese goal \u2014 but has so far not joined 22 other Latin American and Caribbean nations in signing up for China\u2019s flagship international infrastructure programme, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nFor Brazil, says Stuenkel, \u201cBrics is important to show Washington that we have got alternatives. [Not joining Belt and Road] is important to show China that it is a key partner, but we are not desperate for their investment.\u201d\n\nLula has also encountered considerable diplomatic challenges on his own doorstep. The \u201cpink tide\u201d of mainly leftwing Latin American governments in which he swam in his first two terms has been replaced by a more antagonistic regional landscape. Conservative governments in neighbouring Argentina and Paraguay, plus Ecuador and El Salvador, have clashed with the leftwing presidents of Chile, Colombia and Mexico. Few are keen to defer to Lula, the veteran standard-bearer of the Latin American left.\n\nLula has also struggled to revive Unasur, the South American inter-governmental organisation of his earlier presidencies, and his efforts to resolve neighbouring Venezuela\u2019s long-running political crisis have so far led nowhere. Relations with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro have been strained by the latter\u2019s insistence that he won an election in July, following an official result that most independent observers believe was grossly fraudulent.\n\nAfter Brazilian requests to produce evidence of his victory produced months of stonewalling by Maduro, Lula has refused to recognise the election result. Given the long-standing political ties between Lula\u2019s Workers Party (PT) and Maduro\u2019s revolutionary socialist movement PSUV, this was an outcome few had expected.\n\nSpeaking at a congressional hearing, Amorim said there had been a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d in Venezuela, prompting Caracas to accuse him of being a \u201cmessenger of North American imperialism\u201d. After Brazil blocked Venezuela\u2019s efforts to join the Brics, Caracas recalled its ambassador from Brazil and complained of \u201cimmoral aggression\u201d.\n\nGunther Rudzit, assistant professor of international affairs at ESPM, believes Lula\u2019s struggles for regional integration represent a foreign policy defeat. \u201cIf we can\u2019t solve regional problems, trying to lead the global south is simply impossible,\u201d he says.\n\nBut others, such as McKinley, are more sanguine. \u201cI think Brazil has responded to a changed global environment,\u201d he says. \u201cSeeing where Brazil fits in, where Brazil can influence and where Brazil perhaps needs to stand back somewhat.\u201d\n\nThere is broad agreement that the issue of climate change is where Brazil has the most potential \u2014 and moral authority \u2014 to exert diplomatic leadership. Deforestation of the Amazon has fallen sharply under Lula, and the nation already generates most of its electricity from renewable sources and is a leader in biofuels.\n\nSome green campaigners complain of hypocrisy, given that Lula is in favour of expanding Brazil\u2019s oil production. But Bras\u00edlia\u2019s argument that revenues from hydrocarbons can help fund the green transition and social programmes resonates in other developing countries that are rich in fossil fuels.\n\nIn Rio next week, Brazil is set to formally launch an international alliance against hunger, a theme dear to Lula given his childhood experience of poverty. Another key proposal of his G20 presidency is a global tax on the super-rich. Although the US has poured cold water on the idea, Brazil believes its time will come.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like planting seeds,\u201d says one Lula adviser. \u201cThink of the global south idea. It took a long time, but now it is blossoming.\u201d\n\nHowever, what should be Lula\u2019s moment to shine now risks being overshadowed by the election of Trump as US president. The Republican\u2019s scepticism about global warming and disdain for multilateralism threaten some of Brazil\u2019s key foreign policy goals, according to analysts.\n\nThomas Traumann, a political consultant and former Brazilian communications minister, says Lula had \u201cplanned to be centre of the show\u201d, but the political upheaval in Washington will complicate matters.\n\n\u201cThe G20 will probably be a summit of leaders trying to understand what Trump will or will not do,\u201d he adds.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella\n\nData visualisation by Keith Fray", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9dc17aa0-5967-4c56-927f-efe14367c820"}}, {"id": "e3d19223-2e07-4854-b41d-31be8e0fbfce", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s growing gambling habit threatens to hit economy", "blurb": "Explosion of online sports betting in South American nation sparks warnings about its damaging impact", "date": "2024-11-1000:00:00.0", "body": "Struck by cancer in his early thirties, Cl\u00e1udio found solace in a pastime that has hooked millions of his fellow Brazilians: online gambling.\n\nPunts on football results were \u201cjust a bit of fun\u201d at first, but following his diagnosis a few years ago the wagers grew bigger.

The country\u2019s banking association has also raised concerns about indebtedness caused by online betting.\n\nRoberto Campos Neto, Brazil\u2019s central bank governor, has said the \u201cworrying\u201d growth of gambling could begin to hit loan repayments. \u201cThe correlation of people on low incomes and the increase in betting has been strong,\u201d he said recently. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to have the perception that it will have an impact on defaults.\u201d\n\nSome economists predict the trend has the potential to hit Brazilian growth this year.\n\nBrazil\u2019s dilemma echoes that faced by the US, where sports betting is now legal in the majority of states, and the UK, whose long tradition of legalised gambling has been supercharged by the internet.\n\nWith compulsive gambling triggering mental health issues, treatment referrals at the Cl\u00ednicas public hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo had tripled in a year, said psychiatrist Hermano Tavares. \u201cThe health system is not prepared,\u201d he added.\n\nPolice and prosecutors also allege that some illicit sites are used by organised crime for money laundering.\n\nMost games of chance such as casinos and slot machines have been prohibited in Brazil since the 1940s, with a few permitted exceptions including horseracing and state-run lotteries.\n\nThe South American country now ranks first for visits to gambling websites, with 15 per cent of the global total in 2024, according to analytics provider SimilarWeb.\n\nFootball teams and broadcasters have benefited from advertising, while the government will soon start taxing the business.\n\nInternational brands such as bet365 and Betfair vie with homegrown operators for wagers that in 2024 could total R$130bn, according to PwC.\n\nAt least 24mn consumers \u2014 more than 10 per cent of the population \u2014 placed online bets in August totalling R$20bn, according to a central bank study.\n\nThe activity could shave 0.3 per cent off Brazil\u2019s GDP this year, a report by Santander found, although the trend\u2019s possible effects on the economy are hotly debated.\n\nThe retail sector is feeling the pinch, said Danniela Eiger, an analyst at brokerage XP. Several Brazilian chain stores have blamed the phenomenon for weak sales, while a survey of gamblers by a retail association found one-fifth had foregone clothing or travel purchases in favour of bets.\n\n\u201cBetting is competing for consumer money,\u201d Eiger said. \u201cIt has slowed the recovery we hoped to see in demand.\u201d\n\nAbout 5mn people from families on Brazil\u2019s main social welfare programme together spent about R$3bn on bets in August, according to a central bank report, equivalent to one-fifth of the total benefit paid out. The National Association of Games and Lotteries disputed the figure, suggesting it was only a fraction of this amount.\n\nThe sector has also challenged the extent of the economic impact and says most gamblers are not addicts.\n\nA study commissioned by the Brazilian Institution of Responsible Gaming (IBJR) lobby group argued that gambling had not led to an overall increase in indebtedness and suggested it accounted for just 0.5 per cent of household spending, taking into account winnings.\n\nThose on both sides of the debate put many of the problems down to a failure to introduce regulation when online sports betting was liberalised six years ago.\n\nUntil recently, many sites operated from overseas jurisdictions and so were not subject to local laws or taxes, with no official oversight in Brazil or obligation to report suspicious activity.\n\nA lack of rules led to \u201ca market that is a real mess\u201d, said Andr\u00e9 Gelfi, local head of gambling platform Betsson and IBJR president. \u201cYou have everything from advertising to minors to fraudsters on the internet.\u201d\n\nThe government of leftwing President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva accused its predecessor of inaction and has introduced regulation due to come into effect at the start of 2025.\n\nThe rules will introduce taxes on gaming companies and winnings, limit the promotion of gambling by influencers, restrict advertising and outlaw the use of credit cards on betting sites.\n\nDigital operators must now register a local entity and are required to request licences costing R$30mn each by September. The government, which has estimated gambling could yield as much as R$12bn annually in taxes, has blocked 3,400 sites that did not comply, leaving more than 260 accessible.\n\nSupporters believe this approach will drive a shake-out, with bad actors eliminated as industry-wide standards are established.\n\nLula has suggested a ban on digital betting if the new measures do not fix the problems, and officials want to stop the use of welfare payment cards for betting.\n\nThe finance ministry, which oversees the sector, did not respond to interview requests.\n\n\u201cNew regulations do not necessarily mean everything will be resolved overnight,\u201d said Ian Cook, at business advisory StoneTurn. \u201cBut it\u2019s a strong sign of progress for a lucrative industry that was otherwise left to self-regulate for several years.\u201d\n\nWith his cancer in remission, Cl\u00e1udio has found support at Gamblers Anonymous. \u201cMy friends were able to play recreationally and I couldn\u2019t because I was compulsive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disease like any other that can affect anyone, regardless of social class, education or gender.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/dc09667b-f8cb-4904-b790-a8d6cdf47edd"}}, {"id": "68ffa6f4-069f-4868-8923-6a81039aec5b", "event_name": "Brazilian real slump pressures Lula to take action on spending", "blurb": "Leftwing administration promises fiscal containment measures in effort to calm financial markets", "date": "2024-11-0600:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s exchange rate to the dollar has dropped to near record lows, heaping further pressure on the leftwing government to introduce spending cuts quickly and calm mounting investor concerns over its commitment to fiscal discipline.\n\nAfter weeks of the currency declining, president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s administration on Monday confirmed it would soon unveil long-anticipated measures to curb expenditure.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to accelerate the announcement is viewed in part as a reaction to a sharp fall in the real, which has been under strain as fund managers fret over the management of the public finances of Latin America\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe currency is down almost a fifth against the dollar and is the third worst-performing major currency on a total return basis this year. It skirted close to a record low on Wednesday as the greenback surged following the election of Donald Trump.\n\nA 2.6 per cent fall took the real to 5.89 to the dollar, not far off the psychologically-important level of six, according to Bloomberg data, before recovering its losses.\n\n\u201cInvestors, market agents and companies are worried because the government has not shown it is really committed to achieving fiscal sustainability,\u201d said Luiz Fernando Figueiredo, chair of Jive Investments in S\u00e3o Paulo and a former central bank director.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking it more seriously, no doubt. But I\u2019m a little sceptical as to whether it will calm the crowd down,\u201d he added.\n\nThe real has suffered from a sustained dollar rally, similar to other \u201ccarry trade\u201d currencies like the Mexican peso. But asset managers say the Brazilian currency has also been hit by fears that a loose fiscal policy under the Lula administration will feed inflation, and force the central bank to keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nSwaps markets are pricing rates for the South American nation to reach more than 13.5 per cent by the middle of next year, significantly above the current basic lending benchmark of 10.75 per cent. In parallel, Brazilian stocks have fallen nearly 5 per cent since late August.\n\nWith addressing the fiscal issue now the main domestic priority, finance minister Fernando Haddad cancelled a trip to Europe this week at Lula\u2019s request to focus on the cost reduction proposals. Thierry Larose, emerging markets bonds portfolio manager at Swiss bank Vontobel, said a savings figure in the middle of a R$30bn-R$50bn range suggested by local media would be well-received by markets.\n\n\u201cThe US dollar getting close to six against the real and all-time highs has been instrumental in why the government is now changing its attitude, promising finally to cut expenditure,\u201d he added. \u201cThe sell-off has been overextended so it wouldn\u2019t need much to have a rebound in Brazilian assets in general.\u201d\n\nStock markets bounced on Monday when Haddad said the measures would be presented this week. The Bovespa equities index registered its strongest one-day rise since February, paring losses to 3.5 per cent so far in 2024, but the real\u2019s losses resumed after the US election result.\n\nHaddad on Wednesday said discussions with cabinet\u00a0colleagues over the proposals had concluded yesterday and that Lula would in turn send the matter to Congress.\u201cThe ministers are all very aware of the task we have ahead to reinforce the fiscal framework and the predictability and sustainability of the finances in the medium and long term,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMainstream economists warn that Brazil\u2019s gross government debt, which at 78.5 per cent of GDP is relatively elevated for an emerging country, risks reaching unsustainable levels without more significant fiscal adjustments.\n\nLula has pursued a tax-and-spend approach in his third non-consecutive term as president, boosting welfare payments to the poorest and help for homebuyers and debtors.\n\nThe veteran leftist\u2019s ministers had already pledged to eliminate the budget deficit before interest payments in 2024 and generate surpluses thereafter, but until now this has been primarily premised on higher tax revenues.\u00a0The IMF recently upgraded Brazil\u2019s growth forecast to 3 per cent and unemployment is near a record low. Yet investor calls for spending restraint have mounted as inflation runs close to the official target\u2019s cap of 4.5 per cent, leading the central bank to raise interest rates.\n\nUnder consideration are cuts to obligatory expenses, which include items such as pensions and social benefits, which are mandated by the constitution and consume 90 per cent of Brazil\u2019s budget. Ministers aim to ensure compliance with a \u201cfiscal framework\u201d, introduced by the Lula administration last year, which limits spending growth to 2.5 per cent.\n\nAlberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs, said the measures were unlikely to reduce overall government expenditure, given that the fiscal rules also stipulate the budget grows in real terms annually.\n\n\u201cThe fiscal targets are way too lax and leading to a significant increase in public debt. The central bank is hiking again because the economy is overheating. The main reason is excessive fiscal activism,\u201d he said.The spending worries reflect pressures on governments across the region, including Mexico and Colombia, said Eirini Tsekeridou, fixed-income analyst at Julius Baer.\n\n\u201cFiscal discipline will remain an important topic for Latin America in 2025, as consolidation efforts are challenged by\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009both high interest rates [and] also high public debt levels,\u201d Tsekeridou said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/624db99d-3fb9-49df-bbd4-2d754e2af05c"}}, {"id": "9a374ed8-ce97-4e70-a708-8ae975c670f5", "event_name": "S\u00e3o Paulo loss caps dismal local elections for Brazil\u2019s Lula", "blurb": "Defeat of candidates backed by leftwing president at regional level weakens his own re-election prospects", "date": "2024-10-2700:00:00.0", "body": "The incumbent rightwing mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo cruised to victory in local elections in Brazil on Sunday, capping a dismal performance in municipal polls by leftwing parties and candidates backed by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\nRicardo Nunes, mayor since 2021 of the western hemisphere\u2019s largest city, won about 60 per cent of the vote in the run-off against Guilherme Boulos, a leftwing lawmaker seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lula.\n\nPablo Mar\u00e7al, a populist outsider who stoked controversy early on by insulting his opponents, was narrowly eliminated in a first round of voting earlier this month.\n\nNunes\u2019 victory in Brazil\u2019s commercial and financial capital is a stinging blow to Lula, whose Workers\u2019 party won mayoral races in only one of Brazil\u2019s 26 state capitals \u2014 Fortaleza \u2014 and in none of the larger cities, such as Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte or Porto Alegre.\n\nThe broad success of right and centre-right parties underlines Brazil\u2019s growing conservative tilt and the dwindling appeal of traditional leftwing parties, such as the Workers\u2019 party which has its roots in the union activism of the 1980s.\n\nThe results also threaten Lula\u2019s re-election prospects because they reduce his influence over local power centres, which are critical to mobilising votes and running campaigns.\n\nThe 78-year-old president, who took office for a third non-consecutive term at the beginning of last year, has suggested he would like to run in the next presidential cycle in 2026 for another four-year term.\n\nHis popularity since returning to office has by and large remained stable. According to a poll this month by Datafolha, 36 per cent of Brazilians consider his administration to be \u201cgood or great\u201d, while 32 per cent say it is \u201cbad or terrible\u201d.

This is a challenge for the left, which will now operate in a more difficult environment,\u201d he said.\n\nFor many observers, the polls were a victory for a bloc of parties known as the Centr\u00e3o, an amorphous group that eschews ideology and focuses on obtaining resources to build their electoral machines. As a result, the bloc is often effective at local level.\n\nIn the first round alone earlier this month, Centr\u00e3o parties \u2014 including the Social Democratic party, Brazil Union, the Progressives and Nunes\u2019 Brazilian Democratic Movement \u2014 won more than 3,000 mayoral races or more than half of the country.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/450cd4a6-b234-4e7f-b1e8-0d2f27bcea32"}}, {"id": "10f504cf-6e51-4bbc-8920-234622b1520d", "event_name": "BHP and Vale agree landmark $23bn settlement over Brazil dam disaster", "blurb": "Deal relating to damages following 2015 Mariana incident comes as groups face separate lawsuit in London\u2019s High Court", "date": "2024-10-2500:00:00.0", "body": "Mining groups BHP and Vale on Friday signed a landmark R$132bn ($23bn) settlement with authorities in Brazil to provide further reparations and cover damages stemming from the 2015 Mariana dam disaster.\n\nThe agreement seeks to draw a line under years of wrangling over compensation for the incident in the south-eastern state of Minas Gerais, which killed 19 people and caused extensive environmental damage. The settlement will take the mining companies\u2019 indemnity bill to about $30bn.\u201cThese resources will allow us to do justice in reparations to the families directly affected,\u201d Jorge Messias, Brazil\u2019s attorney-general, said after announcing the agreement.\n\nThe settlement comes just days after the High Court in London began hearing a separate multibillion-pound lawsuit brought against the two miners on behalf of about 620,000 alleged victims.\n\nThe plaintiffs, including 2,000 businesses, 46 municipalities and 65 faith-based organisations, previously put the value of their claims at $36bn, before interest and inflation.\n\nThe case is among the most complex of a new breed of high-value lawsuits hitting the English courts, fuelled in part by the rise of funds that specialise in financing litigation.\n\nThe Mariana disaster occurred in November 2015 when a structure holding mining waste ruptured, unleashing an avalanche of mud that swamped villages and contaminated hundreds of kilometres of waterways all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nFour years after the disaster, another of these so-called tailings dams operated by Vale ruptured and collapsed in the nearby Brumadinho township of Minas Gerais, killing 270 people. The tragedies prompted authorities in Brazil to pass legislation phasing out the use of upstream tailings dams, which are cheaper to construct but are considered more hazardous than downstream alternatives.\n\nAt the centre of the settlement on Friday was the payment by the mining groups of more than R$100bn in new compensation to the Brazilian government. The money, which will be paid over 20 years, will be directed towards socio-environmental reparations in the Mariana region.\n\nA further R$32bn will be paid by the companies for \u201cenvironmental and social reparation actions\u201d, such as resettlements and compensation programmes.\n\nThe total package includes compensation of about $6,000 for each person affected by the incident, which increases to almost $17,000 if the person affected was engaged in agriculture or fishing.\n\nThe new payouts come on top of the almost R$38bn that BHP and Vale have already spent through the Renova Foundation that was set up in response to the disaster.\n\nMike Henry, chief executive of BHP, said the companies were committed to \u201cdo what\u2019s right\u201d towards the Brazilian people, while Gustavo Pimenta, the boss of Vale, described the \u201cdefinitive\u201d settlement as a \u201cmutually beneficial resolution for all parties\u201d.\n\nHowever, Tom Goodhead, chief executive of UK law firm Pogust Goodhead, which is representing the claimants in London, said the companies\u2019 settlement with the Brazilian government \u201conly serves to highlight exactly why the proceedings in the English courts are so critical\u201d.\n\nVictims had \u201cnot been consulted\u201d and the London case would make it \u201cmore difficult for multinational corporations more broadly to neglect their responsibility to the communities in which they operate\u201d.\n\nThiago Alves, co-ordinator of the Movimento dos Atingidos por Barragens, an organisation for victims affected by dam disasters in Brazil, said the $6,000 payout per person was \u201cinsufficient\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to press for the [increase] of this amount through other compensation channels as well as through the English lawsuit,\u201d he said\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3cf6c74d-e321-4508-8d2b-8fe8e05d74a6"}}, {"id": "0b619cf0-fd62-46e9-a8a0-1086c34d0f47", "event_name": "Positively Pernambuco \u2013 a story of hope in Brazil", "blurb": "A fashion photographer and a teacher shift the focus onto a close-knit community\u00a0", "date": "2024-10-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Photographer Paulo Almeida has long been inspired by Pernambuco, the north-eastern state of Brazil in which he grew up. \u201cWhat I saw and felt as a child are feelings I\u2019ve tried to capture or recreate every time I\u2019ve\u00a0had the opportunity to photograph there,\u201d says Almeida, who now lives in Paris.

You can register and watch along here \u2014 it starts today.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nLeslie\n\nThe US Department of State gave its backing to a new rare earths project in Brazil on Monday, the latest plan to get support from the Minerals Security Partnership.\n\nThe US-led MSP, which includes 14 countries and the EU, is supposed to be the west\u2019s answer to China\u2019s control of critical minerals and rare earths.\n\nChina dominates the processing for many minerals that are critical to defence and the energy transition, and MSP\u2019s goal is to develop supply chains for those minerals outside of Chinese influence.\n\nThe latest MSP-backed project, the Pela Ema deposit operated by Serra Verde Group, is an example of how the coalition works \u2014 but also shows how far the initiative has to go before it can successfully replicate critical mineral supply chains.\n\nThe Swiss-based company on Monday announced a successful $150mn fundraising from three well-known mining investors: Boston\u2019s Denham Capital; the Energy and Minerals Group of Houston; and Vision Blue, the fund led by former Xstrata chief executive Sir Mick Davis.\n\nThe US state department said: \u201cThis investment is a powerful demonstration of the\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership\u2019s role in establishing sustainable, secure and diversified supply chains.\u201d\n\nBut unlike China, the MSP does not have its own pool of funding for the projects \u2014 all it can do is encourage private capital and state-backed funders such as the US International Development Finance Corporation and Natural Resources Canada to support projects that are presented to the group.\n\nSince it was founded two years ago, the MSP has supported more than a dozen projects for elements including graphite, rare earth and nickel.\n\nAt present the rare earths produced by Serra Verde are all sent to China for processing.\n\nNorth America and Europe have several heavy rare earths processing facilities under construction, but China is the only place in the world that can process the kind of heavy rare earths produced by Serra Verde\u2019s mine.\n\nSerra Verde\u2019s mine in the Brazilian state of Goi\u00e1s produces rare earths from ionic clay, including minerals key for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and wind turbines \u2014 such as neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium. Commercial production began earlier this year, and it is the only active producer of heavy rare earths outside of China, according to the company.\n\nThe advantage of extracting rare earths from clay, rather than from hard rock, is that it is easier to process and does not require crushing, the company said.\n\nChina is the largest miner of ionic clay rare earths. It produces 60 per cent of the world\u2019s rare earths and processes 90 per cent.\n\nThras Moraitis, chief executive of Serra Verde, said the new funds raised would \u201callow us to get to a scale so that we stand on our own two feet and compete economically\u201d.\n\nBecause of China\u2019s ability to produce low-cost rare earths, which keeps prices down, it is difficult for new entrants to break into the market.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the MSP\u2019s support for Serra Verde is part of a broader rapprochement between the US and Brazil. Earlier this year, the IDFC opened up its first office in Latin America in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\u201cBrazil has significant rare earth reserves and they are very untapped. They have about 18 per cent of the worlds\u2019 rare earths reserves, but they produce less than half a per cent,\u201d said Baskaran. \u201cSo if you want to look at rare earth\u2019s potential, it really sits in Brazil.\u201d (Leslie Hook)\n\nEnergy Source is written and edited by Jamie Smyth, Myles McCormick, Amanda Chu, Tom Wilson and Malcolm Moore, with support from the FT\u2019s global team of reporters.

BHP\u2019s main listing is now in Australia, along with its headquarters.\n\nThe legal action in England was welcomed by Thiago Alves, co-ordinator of MAB, an organisation for victims affected by dam disasters in Brazil.\n\nAlves said it was important for \u201cvictims being able to go to a foreign country, to go to the owner\u2019s house to complain\u201d.\n\nYet the case has become a lightning rod for critics of London\u2019s emerging claimant law firms and litigation-funding industry.\n\nBHP said the proceedings, which are being bankrolled by US alternative asset manager Gramercy, were unnecessary and not in the interests of victims.\n\nThe company said in a statement that the London case \u201cduplicates\u201d compensation schemes in Brazil, and that up to 30 per cent of any sums paid through the English courts would be \u201cdiverted\u201d to \u201cclass action lawyers and [litigation] funders\u201d.\n\nLitigation funders such as Gramercy back what they assess to be credible lawsuits in exchange for a cut of any award, making big-ticket litigation a potentially attractive proposition for them.\n\nThe case was being heard thousands of miles away from the site of the catastrophe, noted Kenny Henderson, partner at law firm CMS, who is not involved in the case. While the \u201clong-arm jurisdiction\u201d of English courts was not a new phenomenon, he said, \u201cwhat sets this apart is the size\u201d.\n\nThe legal bill from the proceedings, which has an unprecedented number of claimants, is likely to run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Under the English courts\u2019 system of \u201closer pays\u201d, the losing side typically pays the other party\u2019s legal costs.\n\nGoodhead said the claimants\u2019 legal costs by the end of the first round of proceedings \u2014 which is scheduled to run into next year and will determine whether BHP can be held legally liable \u2014 would amount to about \u00a3250mn.\n\nThe size of any payouts would be subject to a second round of hearings. BHP has agreed to split any sums due with Vale.\n\nThe Australian company has retained \u201cmagic circle\u201d law firm Slaughter and May, with Daniel Toledano KC and Shaheed Fatima KC as barristers.\n\nBHP chief executive Mike Henry is not scheduled to appear, but factual witnesses are expected to include its ex-chief financial officer Peter Beaven.\n\nThe plaintiffs, which include 2,000 businesses, 46 municipalities and 65 faith-based organisations, previously put the value of the claim at $36bn, before interest and inflation. This would include awards for pain and suffering, as well as financial losses and property damages.\n\nHowever, they recognise the estimate represents a \u201chigh-water mark\u201d, as it is based in part on self-declared losses and individual claimants would need to prove them to receive the money if the court finds BHP is legally liable to make payouts.\n\nLegally, the claimants\u2019 case has two strands. The first is that BHP can be held liable for the dam\u2019s collapse because it had a 50 per cent interest in Samarco and benefited financially from the project. The claimants argue the legal principle of \u201cstrict liability\u201d applies, meaning they do not need to prove BHP was at fault.\n\nThe second, alternative, argument is that BHP is liable as a result of its behaviour. In legal papers, the claimants argue that Samarco\u2019s iron ore production had been \u201cramped up at the instance\u201d of both BHP and Vale in an attempt to maintain profits in the face of a falling price of the commodity.\n\nBHP contests both strands. It argues Samarco was an independent entity, with a separate management team that made its own decisions. In its defence filed with the court, BHP denied its executives had knowledge that the dam\u2019s safety had been comprised.\n\nThe mining group also argues that parts of the claim have been brought too late, that the municipalities lack legal standing to bring claims in London, and that some of those who have received payouts signed waiver agreements\u00a0eliminating its legal liability.\n\nBHP said it and Vale had already spent more than $7.9bn on financial assistance, compensation and repair and rebuilding for about 430,000 individuals, local businesses and indigenous communities through the Renova Foundation, set up in response to the disaster.\n\nThe two companies have been holding long-running talks with authorities in Brazil to pay further sums. On top of the $7.9bn, BHP said on Friday that they had proposed an additional R$132bn ($23.8bn), largely to be paid to government entities, but also including other items including \u201ca new compensation system\u201d.\n\nIn a statement ahead of the trial, BHP said that it was seeking to \u201cfinalise a fair and comprehensive compensation and rehabilitation process\u201d that would \u201ckeep funds in Brazil for the Brazilian people and environment affected\u201d.\n\nThe dam collapse \u201cwas a tragedy and our deepest sympathies remain with the impacted families and communities\u201d, BHP added.\n\nGoodhead said there had so far been a \u201csystemic failure\u201d to provide adequate compensation. Many had received only \u201cde minimis\u201d amounts and there were others whom BHP and Vale had \u201csimply not recognised\u201d as being victims.\n\nPogust Goodhead this month filed an application for contempt of court proceedings in London against BHP, saying that it backed legal action in Brazil by the Brazilian Mining Association (IBRAM), which challenged the ability of municipalities to litigate abroad.\n\nThe law firm said in its application: \u201cThe defendants were aware that they were initiating a claim before the Brazilian Courts to adjudicate a matter set to be adjudicated by the English courts.\u201d\n\nBHP declined to comment on the application.\n\nGoodhead recognised it could be several years before claimants received any monies through the English court system.\n\nAlves said that among communities affected there was \u201ca mixture of indignation and fatigue on various levels. But there is also great resilience\u201d.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0bc35108-4adb-4dd0-a049-59e0933dbc55"}}, {"id": "c106e3bb-cf33-4b86-ba38-3aee851b1d8e", "event_name": "X returns to Brazil after Elon Musk complies with court orders", "blurb": "Ban lifted as billionaire backs down on his refusal to remove extremist content from platform", "date": "2024-10-0800:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s supreme court on Tuesday authorised the restoration of public access to Elon Musk\u2019s X following a month-long ban, after the billionaire backed down in his feud with the top tribunal and agreed to remove extremist content from the social media platform.\n\nThe climbdown represents an about-face for Musk, who for months had taunted the court, accusing Justice Alexandre de Moraes of being a \u201cdictator\u201d for demanding that X remove accounts linked to far-right groups in Brazil.\n\n\u201cThis quarrel with X demonstrated that no individual, no corporation and no platform is above the law,\u201d said Luca Belli, a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation law school in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\u201cAlthough many people have tried to frame this as a freedom of speech issue, at the end it really boils down to sovereignty, to the capacity of a country to regulate services and technologies according to laws,\u201d Belli added.\n\nAccess to X in Brazil was suspended by Moraes at the end of August after the company ignored a court deadline to appoint a legal representative for its Brazilian operation \u2014 a requirement under the country\u2019s civil code.\n\nMusk had weeks earlier shuttered X\u2019s office in S\u00e3o Paulo and dismissed its legal representative, alleging that she had been threatened with fines and arrest over the company\u2019s refusal to remove content.\n\nFor much of this year, Musk publicly goaded Moraes on social media, demanding his impeachment and posting mocked-up photos of the justice in prison.\n\nThe actions made the billionaire a hero among many on the Brazilian right, who believe a long-running crusade against online disinformation and extremism by the judge had gone too far.\n\nOne month into its suspension, however, X changed course, agreeing to appoint a legal representative in Brazil and pay millions of dollars in fines, including fees imposed on the platform after it briefly skirted the ban last month using a technical manoeuvre.\n\nX also agreed to remove the accounts that provoked the feud between the judge and the billionaire in the first place.\n\nAhead of lifting the ban, Moraes unfroze bank accounts and assets linked to both X and Musk\u2019s satellite internet provider Starlink.\n\nThe latter had been frozen because Moraes deemed Starlink to be part of a \u201cde facto economic unit\u201d with X.\n\nStarlink is a wholly owned subsidiary of SpaceX, in which Musk owns about 40 per cent of the stock, but commands 79 per cent of voting rights.\n\nBefore the ban, X had roughly 20mn users in Brazil, making it the ninth most popular social media platform, far behind Instagram and TikTok.\n\nAfter the suspension, millions of Brazilians flocked to Bluesky, a similar microblogging site, which claims to have 10mn users worldwide.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6909b478-c0e3-4017-8881-28a57cee3fb1"}}, {"id": "959d1364-25db-4884-92ea-182bdf0d9d39", "event_name": "Karla Osorio: \u2018I have a young gallery, but one that was started when I was 50\u2019", "blurb": "The former lawyer and treasury official has been championing Black Brazilian artists ", "date": "2024-09-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Karla Osorio\u2019s art gallery is not normal for Brazil. First, it is in the capital Bras\u00edlia, which despite Oscar Niemeyer\u2019s renowned architecture, has only a modest arts scene. Secondly, the gallery is spread out over five pavilions, white Modernist blocks that reflect the influence of the architect, in a lush garden of 6,000 sq m into which Osorio\u2019s recent exhibition of Hugo Fran\u00e7a\u2019s monumental wooden sculptures spilled.\n\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, the lawyer and collector turned dealer championed Black artists long before many of her better-known peers in Brazil understood the importance of diversity. \u201cBrazil is 60 per cent Black,\u201d she says simply, stating as an obvious fact something which eluded generations of art dealers. \u201cI think collectors are now more receptive to young Black artists \u2014 it\u2019s an international tendency that Brazil is part of. It\u2019s important, history has to change and we need to give these artists the value they deserve.\u201d\n\nOsorio grew up in Bras\u00edlia and like her father, the first lawyer in the newly built capital and former president of the bar association, she followed a legal career, working for 25 years at the Brazilian Treasury. Yet like her father, she maintained a passion for the arts. \u201cMy father was a collector, but modern art, classical art. And he was also a poet. I have collected art since I was 15 and so it\u2019s been 40 years since I have been involved with art.\u201d Osorio was interested in neoconcretism and Brazil\u2019s major artists, but through those such as the conceptualist\u00a0Almandrade, who she still represents, her interests have become more political.\n\nIn 2000, she created ECCO \u2014 Contemporary Cultural Space, which for more than a decade was the main private non-profit art institution in Bras\u00edlia, showing the likes of Cildo Meireles, H\u00e9lio Oiticica and Nelson Leirner. It was a way of going beyond just collecting, or patronage of other institutions (though she still donates to the likes of the Pompidou), and engaging with artists directly.\u00a0\u201cSeven years ago I decided to retire. And that\u2019s when I opened the commercial gallery. So I tell everybody, listen, I am a young gallery, but one that was started when I was 50.\u201d\n\nOsorio\u2019s first show, in 2016, was with Francisco Galeno, a painter and public artist known for his geometric abstraction, but whose work owes as much to the crafts culture inherited from his family \u2014 his father was a canoe-maker, his mother a seamstress and his\u00a0grandfather a cowboy who made leather goods \u2014 as it does western art history. Her most recent exhibition was Siwaju\u2019s steel sculptures, which subvert their monumental associations to talk of roots and origins and a personal history relating to racism and the land.\n\nIn October the gallery will show at the 1-54 fair for contemporary African art in London for the first time. Appearing at the fair was a long-held dream of Matheus Marques Abu, one of the youngest artists in Osorio\u2019s stable, reflecting his research into the links between the African continent and Brazil. \u201cSince he first came to the gallery, he said, \u2018When I\u2019m a good artist, my dream would be to go to 1-54.\u2019 So being in the fair three and half years later is a good achievement for him.\u201d\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old Abu grew up in straitened circumstances on the periphery of Rio de Janeiro, so he and Osorio represent the extremes of Brazilian society. But when the gallerist first saw his work at an art fair, where he was selling his own paintings for less than $100, they clicked. She invited him to take part in the gallery\u2019s residency programme (one of the pavilions is given over to a studio and accommodation for visiting artists). \u201cHe has worked since he was 15, so he\u2019s a very powerful, intellectually well-honed artist,\u201d Osorio says. \u201cWe just gave him money for materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he was a kid he was always hanging out at the beach, like so many of his friends, jumping in the water, diving, swimming, and after a while he decided he wanted to know more about that sea that he loved so much, and also think more about his origins so studied history, he studied philosophy, all on his own. And gradually he turned to art.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of successful careers such as those of Maxwell Alexandre and Panmela Castro, both of whom Abu assisted, Brazilian artists from the urban periphery have had welcome attention from commercial galleries. Yet this has largely played out in figurative work, often documenting favela life, to the point of saturation. Abu\u2019s work is a great deal stranger and stronger \u2014 his latest paintings show Black men carried aloft by seabirds or flying in tandem with them. He produced a series painted on the panes of reclaimed window frames.\n\n\u201cWhen he talks about the sea, it is about the sea both as a barrier but also a crossing between Africa and Brazil,\u201d Osorio says. \u201cIf you are Black and poor in Brazil, how do you make that crossing? He started making these connections between birds and the men in his painting. He\u2019s always talking about coming and going, about freedom, about who has access or who doesn\u2019t, so it makes a lot of sense in his production to use doors and windows.\u201d\n\nWe end our conversation because a group from a local school is filing into the gallery and Osorio has promised to show them around. \u201cNot many galleries lose two hours of the day hosting children, but we think it\u2019s important. Anyway, maybe they will be clients in the future.\u201d\n\nOctober 11-13, 1-54.com", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c99b65c1-3305-4665-a5af-6b4a22366cb1"}}, {"id": "d17220f5-0baa-46ed-867a-ff227117e600", "event_name": "Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink faces legal jeopardy in Brazil after X ban", "blurb": "Billionaire\u2019s satellite service is considered vital in remote areas but is coming under new scrutiny in Latin American country", "date": "2024-09-2000:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s ban of social media platform X has led to greater scrutiny on another part of Elon Musk\u2019s business empire: Starlink.\n\nFrom Amazonian tribes and farming frontiers, to the armed forces and offshore oil industry, the satellite internet service has connected remote corners of the continent-sized territory to the worldwide web since launching there in 2022.\n\nAccess for Starlink\u2019s 225,000 users in Latin America\u2019s largest nation was thrown into doubt after it was recently dragged into the dispute surrounding the supreme court\u2019s shutdown of X.\n\nThe episode reveals Starlink\u2019s legal vulnerabilities in the country and has raised concerns among hundreds of thousands of people and businesses in Brazil \u2014 often in isolated areas \u2014 for whom it has become a vital tool.\n\n\u201cIf Starlink is blocked, there will be chaos in communications at the farm level, from issuing invoices to [remotely] controlling machines,\u201d said Odacil Ranzi, a crop grower in the rural interior of Bahia state.\n\nWhen X was briefly reinstated in Brazil on Wednesday, the social media platform blamed an \u201cinadvertent\u201d technical update and said it would continue to abide by the nationwide ban.\n\nBut authorities accused it of seeking to deliberately disobey the ruling by supreme justice Alexandre de Moraes from the end of last month.\n\nThe judge had clashed with Musk over X\u2019s refusal to obey court orders to take down accounts suspected of spreading misinformation, before blocking the social network after it failed to appoint a local legal representative.\n\nMoraes also ruled Starlink formed part of the same \u201ceconomic group\u201d because of their ultimate common shareholder, so could be held jointly responsible for X\u2019s court fines.\n\nA subsidiary of rocket builder SpaceX, which is controlled by Musk, Starlink is a distinct company to Musk\u2019s social media group.\n\nStarlink initially refused to implement the X blackout unless authorities reversed what it called an \u201cillegal\u201d freeze of its bank accounts, imposed to guarantee the payment of X\u2019s penalties.\n\nAfter a warning by Anatel, Brazil\u2019s communications regulator, that Starlink could eventually lose its licence to operate if found to be in breach of court rulings, the company abided by the X prohibition.\n\nLast week, Starlink\u2019s assets were unfrozen, but only after R$11mn ($2mn) was taken from its accounts. On Thursday, the court imposed a new daily fine of R$5mn on X if the social media network continued to be available in Brazil, with Starlink also held responsible.\n\nWhile Anatel itself has questioned the practical viability of blocking the service, the dispute has led to worries about Starlink\u2019s position in the country.\n\nAlthough it represents only 0.5 per cent of Brazil\u2019s broadband market, Starlink has rapidly become the leader in satellite internet. Today it controls almost half of the segment, ahead of competitors including HughesNet, Viasat and Telebras.\n\nWith a fleet of low-orbit satellites whose signals reach distant places not served by regular cable and fibre-optic internet providers, telecoms experts said Starlink was cheaper and easier to install than rival products.\n\n\u201cThis combination of better quality and lower cost means that other traditional offers, while in theory competing with Starlink, are in practice not even comparable to it,\u201d said Thiago Ayub, chief technology officer at Sage Networks, an IT services company.\n\nAlongside retail and business subscribers, Starlink has also made inroads into Brazil\u2019s public sector, according to government procurement and transparency sites. The company is understood to have a minimal operational presence in Brazil, with a registered office at a company in S\u00e3o Paulo that provides administrative functions.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. A law firm representing Starlink in Brazil said it was not authorised to comment.\n\nThe service has come under fire from other authorities in Brazil. Public officials say its devices have become an essential communications tool for environmental criminals conducting unauthorised gold prospecting in the Amazon forest.\n\nOn a recent mission by special forces to destroy an illegal mining base this year in the Yanomami indigenous reserve, accompanied by the Financial Times, operatives discovered a Starlink antenna, one of dozens seized this year.\n\n\u201cSometimes you see the miners running away with the equipment on their back,\u201d said one of the security agents. \u201cEvery camp has one.\u201d\n\nConnection to the outside world allows the miners to receive advance warning of helicopter sorties by law enforcement agencies in areas such as the Yanomami lands, an expanse of dense jungle the size of Portugal.\n\nThe FT interviewed half a dozen Brazilian officials in recent months who said Starlink was frequently uncooperative with requests for assistance to identify the location and users of its kits in indigenous or other protected areas. An obstacle was data protection laws prohibiting the release of confidential customer information, several of the people said.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Porreca, a prosecutor in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, said Starlink\u2019s internet services used in illicit actions were often contracted by people acting on behalf of criminals.\n\n\u201cThe problem itself is not internet access,\u201d Carlos Baigorri, head of Anatel, said in a July interview. \u201cThe problem is the illegal activity.\u201d Defenders of Starlink point out that mobile phones and computers are also used by criminals.\n\nHowever, the company appears to have changed tack lately. In a case concerning illegal mining in the Yanomami territory, a confidential supreme court ruling recently ordered the company to hand over geolocation and user data, as first reported by newspaper Valor Economico.

It began with accusations from Pablo Mar\u00e7al, a populist outsider, that other candidates were snorting cocaine. Then his two most popular rivals opted out of a much-anticipated debate.\n\nBut in recent days the race to run the western hemisphere\u2019s largest city has plumbed new depths. Mar\u00e7al \u2014 a rightwing self-help guru and influencer who has taken the election by storm \u2014 was hit with a chair and reportedly injured on Sunday by outside contender Jos\u00e9 Luiz Datena during a live TV broadcast.\n\nMar\u00e7al filed a police complaint, but Datena was unrepentant. \u201cMar\u00e7al has shown that he is a threat to the city,\u201d said the famous television host turned political hopeful. \u201cHe needed to be held to account.\u201d\n\nMar\u00e7al, 37, has shaken up Brazilian politics since he crashed on to the national stage just weeks ago with his mix of savvy social media marketing, unabashed showmanship and outlandish campaign pledges, which even he admits are just \u201cdreams for the city\u201d.\n\nDespite not yet winning the endorsement of Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 the former president and political godfather of Brazil\u2019s populist right \u2014 Mar\u00e7al is a serious contender to win S\u00e3o Paulo when voters go to the polls next month for an expected two-round election.\n\nAs a populist keen to invoke religion and sworn to oppose the existing system, Mar\u00e7al is frequently compared to Bolsonaro, despite strains in the relationship between the two men.\n\nAmong the businessman\u2019s proposals are the construction of the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper, with a height of 1km, as well as a cable car network to connect poorer outlying communities.\n\nOften sporting a baseball cap with an \u201cM\u201d logo, Mar\u00e7al has pledged to triple municipal police officers, turn empty properties into affordable homes and teach entrepreneurship in city schools. \u201cI have no television time, no political godfather, no political coalition because I didn\u2019t want to sell my soul to these guys,\u201d he said in an Instagram video. \u201cI arrived here with a cell phone, the people and God.\u201dHis closest competitors are the incumbent, Ricardo Nunes, a centre-right politician widely seen as the establishment candidate, and Guilherme Boulos, a leftwing lawmaker and former housing activist who many see as a potential future leader of Brazil\u2019s left, currently headed by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\n\u201cMar\u00e7al fits a role that is very much in vogue in Brazilian politics, which is the anti-establishment candidate,\u201d said Eduardo Mello, a professor of politics at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of voters who are disillusioned with the political class, with the established institutions. And they hunger for someone who is really interested in tearing it all to the ground.\u201d\n\nThe clamour, however, has overshadowed many of the pressing problems in the city of 11.5mn, from creaking public transport and rough sleeping to crime and drug addiction.\n\nWith millions of followers on Instagram, Mar\u00e7al pitches simultaneously to Brazil\u2019s growing evangelical population, with a message of God and family, and the country\u2019s urban poor, through advice on how to get rich.\n\n\u201cI think [Mar\u00e7al] has already won the election,\u201d said Jonas Walklys, a 20- year-old fruit seller who lives in a deprived neighbourhood on the city\u2019s outskirts. \u201cHe came from nothing, built his own wealth and has gone into politics to follow a calling.\u201d\n\nMar\u00e7al has declared his assets at about $30mn and regularly touts his success in business. His team describes him as a \u201cmulti-entrepreneur of a multibillion-dollar conglomerate, covering 19 sectors, including real estate, education, insurance, among others\u201d.\n\nBut he has also been the subject of multiple police inquiries and in 2010 was sentenced to four years in jail for qualified theft, a crime considered more serious than simple \u201ctheft\u201d under Brazilian law because of the circumstances of the offence. He never served the sentence, however, because of wrangling over the appeals process. Prosecutors had accused him of being part of a group that was involved in banking fraud. Mar\u00e7al denies any wrongdoing.\n\nHe also has been accused of endangering the lives of dozens of participants in his self-help groups when he took them hiking in bad weather in early 2022. They had to be rescued by firefighters. Mar\u00e7al has also denied wrongdoing over that incident.\n\n\u201cHis popularity is related to the identification of voters, especially men, with his success,\u201d said Camila Rocha de Oliveira, a political scientist at the Brazilian Center for Analysis and Planning.\n\n\u201cMar\u00e7al always talks about being the son of a cleaning lady, who went to public school and became a millionaire. Now he wants to teach poor people to prosper like him.\n\n\u201cIn addition, his use of social media is very intense. He\u2019s a professional influencer who went into politics. This makes a huge difference.\u201d\n\nThe controversies surrounding Mar\u00e7al have drawn wide attention to his campaign. But the influencer suffers from a high rejection rate and at least 44 per cent of paulistanos say they would not vote for him under any circumstances, according to Datafolha.\n\nHe is an \u201cagent of chaos\u201d, said Camila Santos, a lawyer in her 30s. \u201cHis madness is calculated [to win votes]. I will vote for Guilherme Boulos, mainly because of his proposals regarding health and education.\u201d\n\nDespite the lack of buzz around his campaign, Nunes is a quiet favourite among many pundits to win. As incumbent he has greater control over electoral resources; his party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement, is a well-oiled political machine, and Nunes has at least the nominal support of Bolsonaro, who left office last year and remains popular.\n\n\u201cNunes is the candidate of the old clientelistic establishment. He\u2019s not an ideologue,\u201d said Mello.\n\nThe other leading contender is the leftwing Boulos, who has sought to steer his campaign to the centre in recent weeks. Centre-right parties have traditionally dominated the city\u2019s elections, although Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party, which is backing the Boulos campaign, has won the mayoralty twice since 2000.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, the main issue \u2014 both today and historically \u2014 is social inequality. It is an open wound in the richest city in Latin America. In some poorer neighbourhoods, life expectancy can be almost 20 years lower than in the richer neighbourhoods,\u201d Boulos told the Financial Times.\n\nA Real Time Big Data poll this week after the chair incident gave Nunes 24 per cent support, Mar\u00e7al 22 per cent and Boulos 22 per cent. The first round of voting will be on October 6. If no candidate wins more than 50 per cent, a run-off will take place on October 27.\n\nFor Walklys, the fruit seller, there was no doubt about the outcome: \u201cWhat\u2019s broken in our country is the system,\u201d he said. \u201cGod is with [Mar\u00e7al] \u2014 and he will fix the system.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8daaa1f0-c918-4485-9a8c-3ab101ed9807"}}, {"id": "2fae36b6-c609-4ac7-a295-ffa80cc0d775", "event_name": "The FT foreign correspondents\u2019 guide to business dining around the world ", "blurb": "The top tables for breaking bread and sealing deals in great global cities ", "date": "2024-09-1800:00:00.0", "body": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter\u2019s guide to power dining\n\nWhile the pull of the West End remains strong, the banks, law firms and other offices around the Square Mile are increasingly flocking to a reinvigorated Farringdon, where Mayfair\u2019s asset managers can now blast in from Bond Street along the Elizabeth Line. A slew of new restaurant openings in recent years has transformed this area once famed for its historic meat market and 12th-century church into one of London\u2019s most desirable places to dine. Choice spots include Brutto, the late Russell Norman\u2019s Florentine affair, and the traditional French bistro Bouchon Racine, if one can get a table \u2014 a partner I know has their PA batch-book these restaurants whenever reservations open. Cloth, which opened in April this year, has become a fast favourite for its well-priced prix-fixe lunch, while Origin City, a new farm-to-fork joint on the edge of Smithfield Market, skilfully caters to carnivores. Longer-running establishments remain perennially popular too: St John, the nose-to-tail pioneer (it celebrates its 30th anniversary this year) might as well be one neighbouring law firm\u2019s staff canteen; Quality Chop House (and its confit potatoes) needs no introduction; and Luca, with its Michelin-starred Italian fare and excellent wine list, offers ample temptation to test the limits of the company card.\u2014 Niki Blasina, deputy editor, FT Globetrotter\n\nSydney\u2019s restaurant scene often takes a back seat to the foodie hub of Melbourne, but the Emerald City has plenty of hotspots for business lunches, including the burger and steak stalwart Rockpool Bar & Grill and newcomer Shell House, with its louche dining room and impressive terrace. Yet the \u201ctop end\u201d of Sydney has started to show its more modish side in recent years, with places such as modern Cantonese-style restaurant Mr Wong providing an alternative to the leather-seated comfort of more traditional business hotspots. Mr Wong, hidden down an alleyway near Circular Quay, is a bustling two-storey affair and is the marque restaurant run by the Merivale company, a 1960s fashion house turned hospitality business, that has opened most of the trendiest places in town. Mr Wong is an energetic place with the kitchen operating in full view of the tables upstairs and Peking ducks artfully displayed in rows. Famed for its dumpling options and an impressive wine (and sake) list, Mr Wong has rapidly become a business lunch favourite for many.\u00a0\u2014 Nic Fildes, Australia and Pacific correspondent\n\nTime was, if you wanted a decent working lunch in the grey streets that hug the European Commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels, your options were limited to bog-standard Italian or Greek fare. But this summer\u2019s favoured haunt of Eurocrat expense accounts has been Portuguese relative newcomer Puro, for cod and vinho verde to wash down the diplomatic gossip. Located in a space formerly inhabited by a dive bar of undistinguished reputation yards from the EU\u2019s car-park-esque HQ, Puro leans heavily into seafood and Portuguese tradition (even if the caricature\u00a0pen portraits of Cristiano Ronaldo and Eus\u00e9bio on the walls are a bit\u00a0much). Brussels\u2019 Portuguese community is long-standing, and you can find their kitchens on every corner in some parts of the city\u2019s now-hip St Gilles neighbourhood, but Puro is the first to take a stab at the EU bubble. Like most of its rivals, it understands that crowd\u2019s penchant for a two-course, one-hour, half-a-bottle approach to lunch. But those with time to kill and a taxpayer-subsidised credit card should enjoy both octopus to start\u00a0and\u00a0pineapple carpaccio to finish. \u2014 Henry Foy, Brussels bureau chief\n\nThe Central district, where lots of the city\u2019s bankers, lawyers and accountants are based, has remained for years the most buzzing location for business dining. Here corporate lunches can include one of the territory\u2019s best Hainan chicken rice dishes at Mandarin Oriental\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Causette, or a memorable Japanese izakaya-style experience at the hotel\u2019s The Aubrey.\n\nChinese fine-dining restaurant China Tang, which serves excellent dim sum,\u00a0remains particularly popular for work lunches. The members-only China Club, an alternative nearby choice, offers a more exclusive environment in which to chat over exquisite traditional Cantonese cuisine that\u00a0has received the stamp of approval from the city\u2019s elite\u00a0for years.\u00a0As the day ends, Cardinal Point with its stunning view of the dazzling skyline is perfect for talking business over drinks \u2014 and to take in Hong Kong\u2019s signature skyscrapers at night.\u2014 Chan Ho-him, Hong Kong reporter\n\nLangosteria is a buzzy seafood restaurant that locals, fashionistas and business people have long been obsessed with. The city is full of great high-end eateries, but some of the classic choices have lost traction or shut down, paving the way for Langosteria\u2019s success. However, the venue \u2014\u00a0co-owned by founder Enrico Buonocore and the Moncler-controlling Ruffini family \u2014 has an extra ingredient that makes it particularly appealing to business people and big spenders: the cool factor, which is reflected in everything from the design and the bar to\u00a0the endless wine list. It recently opened in Paris and has other locations in St Moritz and Portofino. But in Milan, where Langosteria first set up shop and where it currently has three locations serving similar menus, it continues to be the top choice for business diners, which can mean long waiting lists, especially at peak times on Thursday and Friday evenings.\u00a0\u2014 Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli, Milan correspondent\n\nNigeria is experiencing its worst economic crisis in three decades. But you wouldn\u2019t know it when you walk into Farfallino, a new Italian restaurant in the business district of Victoria Island whose popularity has soared since its April opening. Its menu offers the usual Italian fare and wine that would win a nonna\u2019s approval. The pizzas are a must-have. In a city with limited high-quality dining options and a constant search for the next big thing, it\u2019s no surprise the well-heeled throng to Farfallino. Reviews have been mixed, and the prices are eye-wateringly high, but there\u2019s a consensus that it is the place to be.\u2014 Aanu Adeoye, west and central Africa correspondent\n\nSet on the grounds of the massive former Carlsberg brewery, Copenhagen\u2019s newest district has deliberately placed food at the heart of its offering and is drawing business diners (and many others) in droves. Carlsberg Byen, situated to the west of the city centre, is home to some of the biggest and buzziest names from the capital of Nordic cuisine, as well as still hosting the brewer\u2019s headquarters and a new exhibition about the beer. Surt makes some of Copenhagen\u2019s best pizzas, Hija de Sanchez does fabulous tacos and at Aamanns Genbo you\u2019ll find innovative sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d, the open-faced sandwiches that are a must for a business lunch. Hart Bageri, K\u00f8benhavns Bageri and Coffee Collective all offer delectable pastries and decent coffee.\u2014 Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic correspondent\n\nIt is perhaps precisely because of Frankfurt\u2019s gastronomical commitment to pork, potatoes, and apfelwein that it in recent years has become fertile ground for ambitious vegan restaurants. Trailblazers such as Michelin-starred Seven Swans, with its plant-based menu made from seasonal and regionally sourced roots and leaves (and chic neighbouring cocktail bar The Tiny Cup, located in the narrowest building in Frankfurt), set the stage for this shift more than a decade ago. Now, newcomers such as the hip, tapas-inspired Leuchtendroter and the (aesthetically\u00a0at least) more traditionally German Hohenheim & S\u00f6hne are joining the scene, turning Frankfurt into an unexpected hotspot for inventive vegan cuisine \u2014 a vibrant counterpoint to its traditional culinary tapestry.\u2014 Patricia Nilsson, Frankfurt\u00a0correspondent\n\nIn Brazil\u2019s financial capital, a gastronomic hub has emerged in the past few years on Rua Ferreira de Ara\u00fajo, in the Pinheiros neighbourhood. The street is a 10-15 minute drive from the big banks and investment firms on Avenida Faria Lima, the nation\u2019s version of Wall Street. Among its dozens of restaurants and bars, there\u2019s Italian at Pi\u00f9, Modern Mamma Osteria (MOMA) and Tartuferia, which specialises in dishes with truffles.\u00a0Canto do Picu\u00ed offers cuisine from the north-eastern Brazilian state of Alagoas. For Middle Eastern street food in a relaxed setting (and plenty of vegetarian options), try Shuk Falafel & Kebabs.\u00a0\u2014 Michael Pooler, Brazil correspondent\n\nNew York\u2019s love affair with Italian food has taken a more curated twist in recent years. Stuck in Midtown? Try the classic Casa Lever, a space-age cathedral with your choice of private booth or main-floor dining, which is best known for its crudos and osso bucco alla Milanese. Venturing downtown, dine at the recently opened Roscioli in SoHo. The tasting menu of Roman delights or cacio e pepe will bring you back to the restaurant\u2019s origins in Campo dei Fiori in the heart of Italy\u2019s capital. Seafood perhaps? Then Santi may be worth the wait. Michael White, the former executive chef of Marea (a longtime classic) is opening this new haunt this autumn, and it\u2019s already being hyped as a hotspot for New York\u2019s power brokers. \u2014 Sophie Spiegelberger, US audience engagement journalist\n\nThe Kronenhalle is that rarest of things: a restaurant as microcosm. This grand dame of the Zurich restaurant scene survives all attempts of flashier, more on-trend, more novel, more \u2014 frankly \u2014 delicious restaurants to unseat it. Perhaps because, with its starchy but friendly mix of formality and egalitarianism, its heavy r\u00f6stis and cream sauces on the table, thick china plates below Mir\u00f3s on the wall (and Braques and Chagalls and Bonnards), its intimacy and its openness (they\u2019ll get you in if they can), not to mention its epic timelessness, it is as if this restaurant is mainlining Z\u00fcrchers ur-conception of self and Swissness.\n\nEveryone is here. (Everyone who has of course, vaulted the high financial bar of this most expensive to live in or visit of cities.) Eating here is like being on the Orient Express of old, in the Christie conception, only without the murder. The dark wood and brass and the booths of the downstairs \u201cbrasserie\u201d room add to the sense of a wagon-lit. But what really does it is the cast of fellow diners: princesses and swindlers and bank CEOs and DJs and ruby-wedding celebrants down from the mountains and jobbing poets and you. \u201cCeci n\u2019est pas un mus\u00e9e,\u201d the restaurant declares on its website, paraphrasing Magritte with a wink. Of course it is (clich\u00e9 incoming): a living one. \u2014 Sam Jones, FT correspondent\n\nMuch of Mumbai\u2019s business dining remains in the unimaginative confines of high-end hotels where you\u2019ll see a mix of suited locals and foreign visitors at the often-excellent in-house Indian restaurant or less-exciting western equivalent. Others head to international Asian chains such as Hakkasan and Yauatcha. But more restaurants have drawn the after-work crowd with less-bloating modern takes on Indian or fusion-type\u00a0cuisine.\u00a0A powerful Mumbai corporate lawyer recommends the recently opened Ode in Worli, whose menu including pizza and spiced buffalo tenderloin draws on the Maharashtrian and European heritage of\u00a0Rahul Akerkar,\u00a0one of the city\u2019s most renowned chefs.\u00a0More established favourites include the nearby Bombay Canteen and its sibling restaurant O Pedro in the glitzy BKC district, known for their seasonal and Goan delicacies. \u2014 Chris Kay, Mumbai correspondent\n\nThe exquisite demands of Madrid\u2019s power lunchers have helped make the city a global gastronomic hub, and today the business crowd flocks to Calle de Jorge Juan in the chichi Salamanca neighbourhood, a narrow thoroughfare of towering trees and whitewashed apartments, its terraces bubbling over with conviviality. Celebrity chef Dani Garc\u00eda does seafood at Lobito de Mar. Amaz\u00f3nico is a jungle-themed place with a gonzo playfulness. The starched tablecloths of El Paraguas frame Asturian cuisine of classical refinement. Luxury shopping abounds too, including down the secluded Callej\u00f3n de Puigcerd\u00e0, where there is Roman food at SottoSopra and thick-cut sushi at Robata. All told, says one veteran expat, the street is the centre of Madrid\u2019s \u201cCNBC scene\u201d. \u2014 Barney Jopson, Spain and Portugal correspondent\n\nHead to Valois in the eighth arrondissement for classic French bistro fare adjacent to leafy Parc Monceau. It is stone\u2019s throw from Lazard and Morgan Stanley, so bankers abound. Le Bristol for breakfast (the fruits rouges are a delight, if wildly pricey) and for drinks in the evening \u2014 the martinis are among the city\u2019s best. Matsuhisa\u2019s Japanese-Peruvian\u00a0fusion in Le Royal Monceau-Raffles Paris is a welcome reprieve when you\u2019ve had your fill of beef and butter, and the airy setting\u00a0allows for privacy. Au Petit Riche (ninth arrondissement) is an institution for a reason, and everything you could wish for in a classic French restaurant. Across the river, Ja\u00efs (seventh arrondissement) offers a lobster salad worth crossing the city for and is heavily frequented by Left Bank lawyers. Finally, if you want to\u00a0impress with your cultural nous, Ogata\u2019s immaculate Japanese set menus in the Marais should help you close the deal.\u00a0\u2014 Adrienne Klasa, Paris correspondent\n\nRome is beloved for its classic pastas, from amatriciana to cacio e pepe, but it can be rather hard to go back to work after partaking of such rich fare. Hence the popularity of Ginger Sapori e Saluti, with its health-conscious menu focusing on seasonal organic ingredients.\u00a0Roman ladies who lunch and business diners flock here for its gourmet panini and generous salads laden with Italian treats such as Parma ham, fresh buffalo mozzarella and Parmigiano Reggiano; Ginger\u2019s own take on more classic fare including pastas, grilled meats and burgers; and more unexpected offerings such as a quinoa or tuna poke bowl. Vegetarians and vegans are well catered for, while fresh fruit smoothies are an antidote to the typical Italian carb overdose. Don\u2019t miss the amazing vegan raspberry cheesecake, even if you aren\u2019t a vegan. Ginger has expanded to three prime sites in the historic centre, the latest of which opened a year ago in the courtyard of an 18th-century palazzo.\n\nThose searching for greater tradition can opt for the old Roman favourite Ciampini \u2014 in the nearby Piazza di San Lorenzo in Lucina \u2014 where Italian political power brokers famously go to see and be seen, as much as for the food.\u00a0\u2014 Amy Kazmin, Rome correspondent\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite city for business dining?

It can be summed up in one word: oil.\n\nAs the South American nation looks to pump increasing volumes of crude from offshore rigs, his government has a goal for Brazil to become the world\u2019s fourth-largest petroleum producer, up from eighth place. Lula sees oil as a central pillar of Brazil\u2019s strategy for economic growth.\n\nThere is a push to identify new deposits under the seabed \u2014 including one controversial plan to drill for oil in deep waters off the mouth of the Amazon.\n\nThe proposals have been criticised by campaigners who say they clash with Lula\u2019s sustainability claims. \u201cThere\u2019s no coherence at all,\u201d says Suely Ara\u00fajo, public policy co-ordinator at the non-profit Climate Observatory. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a leader on the environment and climate and at the same time become a mega-producer of oil.\u201d\n\nAs Brazil prepares to host next year\u2019s UN climate conference, or COP, the issue threatens to overshadow its leftwing leader\u2019s crowning moment of ecological diplomacy.\n\nYet while Lula has staked his international reputation on the environment, at home he needs to deliver on pledges to alleviate poverty. Many in his Workers\u2019 party (PT) and beyond view Brazil\u2019s oil riches as a key ingredient for national development.\n\nThose in favour of tapping Brazil\u2019s hydrocarbon wealth say that even with the global consumption of crude expected to fall in the shift to cleaner energy, it will still be a part of the worldwide mix for decades. They argue that proceeds from oil and gas sales can assist in funding Brazil\u2019s transition, boosting its low-carbon credentials.\n\nThe country leads the G20 in renewable electricity, which provided 89 per cent of its power in 2023, according to energy think-tank Ember. The Lula government has pledged to end all deforestation by 2030 and revised up its emissions reduction targets.\n\n\u201cThere is no contradiction in our national energy policy,\u201d says mines and energy minister Alexandre Silveira, who argues Brazil must be \u201cpragmatic\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are putting transition policy into practice, but we cannot pay the price alone,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhy can the US and Saudi Arabia continue being oil suppliers and not Brazil? It\u2019s a mismatch and often there\u2019s a hypocritical demand from countries that don\u2019t have oil. For example, France.\u201d\n\nA series of extreme weather events in Brazil over the past year linked by scientists to climate change \u2014 including drought, floods and heatwaves \u2014 have injected greater urgency to the debate. Massive wildfires have cast smoke across large swaths of the country in recent weeks.\n\nCarlos Nobre, a renowned Earth systems scientist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, says with global temperatures rising faster than previously predicted, \u201cit makes no sense\u201d to pursue new hydrocarbon exploration, in Brazil \u2014 or anywhere else.\n\n\u201cIf we continue with existing fossil fuels, then we get to 2050 with large emissions, and then the temperature will go beyond 2.5 degrees [centigrade above pre-industrial levels], he adds. \u201cThis is an ecocide for the planet.\u201d\n\nLula\u2019s personal connection with oil traces back to his first term in office, when in 2006 state-controlled company Petrobras made a blockbuster discovery off the coastline of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAs deep as 7km below the ocean surface, the enormous reservoirs are called the \u201cpre-salt\u201d layer because they are trapped beneath a thick crust of sodium chloride. Billed as one of the largest finds this century, Lula declared that it proved \u201cGod is Brazilian\u201d.\n\nWhile oil money helped fund social programmes under PT-led governments, the euphoria did not last. First a commodities slump punctured Brazil\u2019s economic boom. Then a corruption scandal centred on Petrobras jailed dozens of businessmen and politicians including Lula, whose convictions were quashed in 2021. Under PT rule, the company also suffered political interference and mismanagement.\n\nToday, crude oil is Brazil\u2019s second-largest export, after soyabeans, with China by far the largest buyer. The sector accounts for about 10 per cent of GDP.\n\nDaily output was 3.2mn barrels in June, about 3 per cent of the world total. Most is from the pre-salt layer, dominated by Petrobras in partnerships with international majors such as Shell, TotalEnergies and China\u2019s Cnooc.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t always a foregone conclusion that Brazil would be an oil superpower,\u201d says Schreiner Parker at consultancy Rystad Energy. \u201cThe development costs of pre-salt assets were enormous, requiring a huge capital outlay. We\u2019re starting to see the fruits of that now.\u201d\n\nEnergy experts say future oil supply will need to be cheap and have a smaller carbon footprint in order to remain competitive with renewables amid carbon taxes and an eventual decline in demand. Pre-salt proponents say it is ideally suited.\n\nFloating platforms connected to deepwater wells enjoy massive economies of scale that bring down unit costs. The process to extract a barrel of pre-salt oil emits 8-9kg of CO\u2082, or about half the global average, according to Rystad.\n\n\u201cIf oil is demanded by the world, [Brazil] can say, \u2018Why should I not be the one producing it when we have really good emissions compared to other producers?\u2019\u201d says Francisco Monaldi, a Latin America energy expert at Rice University in Houston. \u201cEven in the most extreme net zero [emissions] scenario you need significant investment to compensate for declining oil production.\u201d\n\nWith Brazil\u2019s crude output forecast to peak by the start of the next decade and then fall, both Petrobras and Bras\u00edlia are keen to replenish the reserves.\n\nThe great hope is the so-called Equatorial Margin: a 2,200km stretch of the Atlantic off the country\u2019s northern coast, facing some of Brazil\u2019s poorest states.\n\nThe five basins within this new frontier may contain 10bn recoverable barrels of oil, requiring $56bn of investment, the Ministry of Mines and Energy has estimated. This could increase Brazil\u2019s proven reserves by more than a third and result in $200bn in tax revenues, it estimated. Minister Silveira has called it \u201ca passport to the future\u201d.\n\nPetrobras has dedicated two-fifths of its $7.5bn exploration budget over five years to the zone. It began exploratory drilling in deep waters in one of the basins this year and confirmed oil there.\n\nYet there are obstacles to the most prized section: the Foz do Amazonas basin \u2014 \u201cthe mouth of the Amazon river\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is believed to be one of the most promising regions in the Brazilian Equatorial Margin, as it shares geology with neighbouring Guyana, where ExxonMobil is developing huge fields,\u201d says Adriano Pires, founder of consultancy Centro Brasileiro de Infra Estrutura.\n\nHowever, regulators last year rejected a request by Petrobras for a licence to drill an exploratory well there, in a block the company says lies 500km from the river\u2019s mouth and 160km from the coastline of Amap\u00e1 state. The case has become a flashpoint for the wider controversy.\n\nActivists say drilling poses risks to a biodiverse and ecologically sensitive areas by the estuary, home to fishing communities as well as mangroves, a coral reef and dolphins. They warn that any spills could be carried far by currents.\n\nThe environmental agency, Ibama, cited a lack of in-depth studies into the suitability of the region for oil production, possible impacts on indigenous populations from overhead flights and insufficient plans to safeguard wildlife in the event of spills. An appeal by Petrobras is under consideration.\n\nIbama\u2019s head, Rodrigo Agostinho, said the biggest concern was the block\u2019s location from the nearest support base: \u201cIn a possible emergency, being so far away was unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIndustry analysts point out Petrobras\u2019s long experience and expertise on the high seas. The company, which declined interview requests, insists it can conduct the activity safely and has said it does not intend to drill in coastal regions or near sensitive areas.\n\nIts new chief executive, Magda Chambriard, recently said 10 years had already been lost, since the block in question was auctioned off by the oil regulator in 2013.\n\nTotalEnergies and BP held interests in the basin but gave them up after abandoning efforts to obtain drill permits. \u201cIt is not credible that three major oil companies are not fulfilling their role in terms of licensing,\u201d Chambriard told an event in June.\n\nWith development expected to take several years from first drilling approval, the fear is that the moment could slip away. Brazil\u2019s offshore prospects take longer and more capital to get up and running compared with US or Argentine shale plays, notes Monaldi.\n\n\u201cBy the time they develop the Equatorial Margin, it could be the demand for oil has weakened and not many investors are willing to risk stranded assets.\u201d\n\nOfficials insist the Foz do Amazonas well request will be decided by regulators on technical rather than political grounds. But to those on both sides of the debate, it will prove an acid test either of Lula\u2019s environmental bona fides or his commitment to drive economic progress.\n\n\u201cWhat we can\u2019t say is that a priori we are going to give up exploring this wealth, which if the predictions are true, will be very great for Brazil,\u201d the president himself said in June.\n\n\u201cIs it contradictory? It is, because we are investing a lot in the energy transition. But as long as the energy transition doesn\u2019t solve our problem, Brazil has to make money from this oil.\u201d\n\nBut within the administration there are differing views. A more cautious approach is expressed by environment minister Marina Silva, who has previously called for a \u201cceiling\u201d on oil exploration.\n\n\u201cEven if we manage to eliminate CO\u2082 emissions due to deforestation, if the world does not stop emitting CO\u2082 due to the use of coal, oil and gas, forests will be destroyed in the same way. So it is a challenge for humanity,\u201d she says.\n\nA life-long green campaigner, Silva served in the same role under Lula during his first stint as president and was credited with overseeing an earlier reduction in Amazon deforestation after years of increases. However, she quit government in 2008 and accused Lula of being in hock with agribusiness.\n\nSilva avoids stating a position on the new oil front in the Atlantic. She says the debate cannot be reduced to one country and calls for wealthy nations to help finance the developing world\u2019s green shift, but is clear about the collective obligations: \u201cA commitment was made during COP28 [in 2023], together with all signatory countries, that we must transition to the end of fossil fuel use.\u201d\n\nAt the same UN climate summit, Brazil faced an outcry from activists after announcing it was to align more closely with the oil cartel Opec, though as an observer not subject to its production quotas. Lula justified it as a way to influence petrostates to invest more in renewables.\n\nBrazil already directs some pre-salt revenues towards a fund for social spending and this could be expanded to include ecological projects, says minister Silveira.\n\n\u201cIf [Lula] takes a significant amount of those resources to reduce emissions from agriculture and deforestation, he could achieve a better net result,\u201d says Monaldi, referring to the origin of most of Brazil\u2019s greenhouse gases.\n\nBut given the country\u2019s strained public finances, to be credible there will need to be clear limits on how the proceeds are used, he adds.\n\nPetrobras says it is investing in greener alternatives, having doubled its pot for low-carbon projects to $11.5bn over five years. But critics argue the sum is dwarfed by the $73bn dedicated to exploration and production over the same period.\n\nInspecting an overturned tractor caked in mud, Otavino Vedovatto recounted the impact of the worst natural disaster in the history of Brazil\u2019s southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul, a few months ago.\n\nExtreme flooding washed out rice fields on his farm in Eldorado do Sul, outside state capital Porto Alegre. All the chickens and pigs drowned. Machinery was damaged.\n\n\u201cNature has given us signs,\u201d says the 57-year-old resident of a settlement established by the leftwing Landless Workers\u2019 Movement. \u201cShe is exacting a price for the actions of human beings.\u201d\n\nIt was the fourth significant flood to hit the region in less than a year. One estimate put the reconstruction bill at R$110bn ($20bn) and there are warnings that households, businesses and whole towns at risk from future occurrences may need to move.\n\nClimate change made rainfall more likely in Rio Grande do Sul, according to a study by the World Weather Attribution, an academic research collaboration. It made similar findings in relation to an exceptional drought in the Amazon river basin and fires in Brazil\u2019s Pantanal tropical wetlands.\n\nThe scientist Nobre says \u201cthere is no question\u201d that the increased intensity and frequency of such events is due to man-made global warming. The episodes have renewed calls for Lula to reconsider his bet on black gold.\n\nRaissa Ferreira, campaign director at Greenpeace Brazil, says if the country is serious about its commitment to limit global temperatures to within 1.5C, there needs to be a \u201cradical change\u201d in its policies towards fossil fuels. \u201cThey are a loan shark that will backfire really seriously in our economy and our lives,\u201d she adds.\n\nIn the meantime, the pending drilling appeal by Petrobras will hang over the countdown to COP30, due to take place in the Amazonian city of Bel\u00e9m in November 2025.\n\nAlthough an official from the environment ministry has suggested that the licence decision could be delayed until after the conference, Silveira, the mines and energy minister, tells the FT he believes it will be resolved this year.\n\n\u201cFor Brazil to lead COP30, [it] could not be a country still defending increasing emissions by fossil fuels,\u201d says Nobre. \u201cWe really have to get to zero, because we have tremendous potential with renewable energy and I hope Lula\u2019s government will go in that direction.\u201d\n\nIn his inauguration speech, the president said that \u201cno other country has the conditions like Brazil to become a great environmental power\u201d.\n\nIn a tightrope act between environmental preservation and economic growth, Lula will soon have to convince the world exactly what this means.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella\n\nData visualisation and cartography by Aditi Bhandari, Ian Bott, Steven Bernard and Justine Williams", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8d25d4d5-0258-4676-81ab-30bb711f4fd2"}}, {"id": "a6c8fa8f-6219-4624-bc0b-e2c51c9aec1a", "event_name": "WTO chief urges EU to rethink deforested goods ban", "blurb": "Call from Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala adds to pressure from exporters including Brazil to \u2018reassess\u2019 rules", "date": "2024-09-1200:00:00.0", "body": "The head of the World Trade Organization has asked Brussels to \u201crelook\u201d at a ban on imports from deforested areas that has angered dozens of countries, increasing pressure on the European Commission over the landmark legislation.\n\nExports of wood, soya and coffee are among the products affected by the new rules, which are due to start on December 30.\n\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala said the EU had not yet issued clear compliance guidelines, leading to uncertainty for exporters who did not know if their goods would be stopped at its borders.\n\n\u201cI want to give the EU credit for listening, coming in and engaging and listening to other members.

They leave land fallow to regenerate for up to 10 years. They then clear any trees to plant crops.\n\n\u201cIs that deforestation? How do we take this into account? Those are the tricky problems that the purchasers have to deal with because they have to certify that the farmers they\u2019re buying from have not deforested.\u201d\n\nEU officials have indicated that the commission is considering a delay to the overall implementation or a simplification of the rules. But this would require reopening the legislation, which some officials fear could create a bigger political fight.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala\u2019s intervention came as Brazil asked Brussels for a delay to the \u201cunilateral and punitive\u201d rules, which would cover about a third of its exports to the EU.\n\nIn an effort to prevent European consumers from contributing to global deforestation, commodities and products from the sectors covered that originate from deforested land will be banned from the bloc. The rules also cover other commodities such as palm oil, cocoa and rubber.\n\nIn a letter sent on Thursday Mauro Vieira and Carlos F\u00e1varo, Brazil\u2019s foreign affairs and agriculture ministers respectively, requested that the EU delay implementation of the law, due to come into force on December 30, and \u201curgently reassess its approach\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe consider the EU Deforestation Regulation to be a unilateral and punitive instrument that disregards national laws on combating deforestation,\u201d the ministers wrote.\n\nThe commission declined to comment on the Brazilian letter but said it would reply \u201cin due course\u201d.\n\nBrazil and Colombia have asked for a debate on the measure at the WTO. They intend to put pressure on the EU, one official said. But neither country has yet initiated a formal complaint.\n\nPascal Canfin, an MEP who was former chair of the European parliament\u2019s environment committee, called on Brazil to speed up moves to ban deforestation.\n\n\u201cBrazil finds the deforestation regulation problematic since it covers one-third of its exports linked to deforestation. It is up to Brazil to ban deforestation, not the EU to change its rules,\u201d he said in a post on X.\n\nBut Bernd Lange, chair of parliament\u2019s trade committee, on Thursday urged the commission to publish guidance \u201curgently\u201d and consult trading partners.\n\nBrazil\u2019s complaint echoes the concerns of others including the US, which said in June that the law presented \u201ccritical challenges\u201d to American timber, pulp and paper producers.\n\nDiplomats from countries in Latin America and south-east Asia, which are leading exporters of commodities such as coffee and palm oil, have also pushed back against the EU\u2019s system of grading countries.

A survey by AtlasIntel found nearly 51 per cent of respondents disagreed with the ban, versus just over 48 per cent in favour.\n\nSpeakers at the event on Avenida Paulista urged senators to launch an impeachment of the judge, who has also become a target for wider criticisms that Brazil\u2019s supreme court is overreaching its legal limits.\n\nThey also appealed for an amnesty for people arrested in connection with the storming of government buildings in Bras\u00edlia on January 8, 2023 by radical Bolsonaro supporters.\n\nMany of the rioters called for a military coup against leftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who defeated Bolsonaro in the previous year\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cI hope that the federal senate puts a stop to this dictator Alexandre de Moraes, who does more harm to Brazil than Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva himself,\u201d Bolsonaro said on stage.\n\nThe ex-president faces a number of supreme court investigations from his time in office, including over an alleged coup plot \u2014 that was never implemented \u2014 to stay in power.\n\nResearchers at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo estimated there were 45,400 people at Saturday\u2019s event in Brazil\u2019s largest city.\n\nThe trigger for X\u2019s suspension was its failure to meet a deadline set by Moraes to appoint a new legal representative in the country, as required by domestic law. Musk had closed the company\u2019s local office last month in protest at the judge\u2019s orders.\n\nIn his decision to block access to the platform, Moraes said X was seeking to create an environment of \u201ctotal impunity\u201d and a \u201clawless land\u201d on Brazilian social media ahead of municipal elections next month.\n\nCreomar de Souza at consultancy Dharma Political Risk said impeachment of the justice was unlikely for now: \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re in for a long battle between Moraes and political forces in Brazil and abroad\u201d.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/142a6d95-b06e-47e3-a605-a203e2bc432f"}}, {"id": "c2288f33-ba70-4d1a-98db-6a2582885aea", "event_name": "Alexandre de Moraes, the steely Brazilian judge facing down Musk ", "blurb": "Already known for his battles with Bolsonaro, his ban on X has pitched him into the centre of a new fight", "date": "2024-09-0600:00:00.0", "body": "Speaking before an audience of senators in Bras\u00edlia earlier this year, supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes mused on one of the great conundrums of the internet age. \u201cAt the turn of the century, there was no social media.

To detractors, he is guilty of censorship and unfairly targets conservatives.\n\nMoraes decreed X\u2019s suspension after it failed to meet a deadline he set to appoint a new legal representative, as required by Brazilian law. It followed an escalating tit-for-tat with Musk over takedown orders. The tech entrepreneur has labelled the judge a \u201cdictator\u201d, echoing Brazil\u2019s rightwing movement.\u201cIt was an extreme act that impacted the lives of many citizens,\u201d former supreme court justice Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello told CNN Brasil. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cultural advance, but a setback\u201d. Even some who once backed the justice\u2019s hardline stance now wonder if he has over-reached.\n\nMoraes has never shied away from political storms. In the past he has engaged in heated confrontations with former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro. He has spearheaded a controversial crackdown against misinformation online, issuing social media account bans and fining platforms.\n\nTall, bald and imposing, the divisive figure nicknamed Xand\u00e3o \u2014 or \u201cBig Alex\u201d \u2014 is considered one of the most influential people in Brazil. He earned praise from adversaries of Bolsonaro for facing down the populist leader. But for Bolsonaristas, Moraes is anathema. The judge has become a lightning rod for criticism that Brazil\u2019s supreme court is exceeding its constitutional boundaries. His opponents warn of a slide into judicial autocracy.\u00a0At a rally in S\u00e3o Paulo on Saturday to mark Brazil\u2019s independence day, tens of thousands of protesters are expected to demand his impeachment.\n\nWhile leftist president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has endorsed his actions against X, Moraes is an unlikely progressive darling. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a conservative, since his days as a college student. The extreme right now trying to label him as a leftwinger is laughable,\u201d says one person who worked with the court.\n\nBorn and raised in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Moraes studied at the state\u2019s prestigious public university. He served in political roles in its state and municipal governments before becoming justice minister under centre-right president Michel Temer, who appointed him to the supreme court in 2017. At the time, Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party slammed the nomination.\n\nThe justice\u2019s pastimes offer a glimpse into his psychology. A supporter of the Corinthians football club \u2014 whose fans revel in their \u201ccrazy\u201d reputation \u2014 he also practises the martial art muay thai.\u00a0In a rare media interview with Le Monde, he revealed a passion for biographies of towering historical leaders like Winston Churchill, Julius Caesar and his namesake Alexander the Great.\n\nA turning point in Moraes\u2019s career trejectory came during Covid-19, when the supreme court challenged government policies. Bolsonaro\u2019s attacks on the institution led to a battle of wills with Moraes, whose judgments the then-president openly vowed to disobey at one point.\n\nAnother point of contention was Bolsonaro\u2019s unproven assertions that Brazil\u2019s electronic voting machines were vulnerable to fraud. After he summoned foreign ambassadors to air the claims, an electoral tribunal headed by Moraes barred the rightwinger from running for office until 2030. Bolsonaro denied any wrongdoing.\n\nPeople who know the justice suggest that his experience as a prosecutor has shaped his combative approach against perceived threats to democratic institutions. \u201cFor him it\u2019s a constant fight,\u201d said one. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave any gaps open.\u201d\n\nTo allies of Moraes, these dangers were displayed on January 8 2023, when radical Bolsonaristas trashed government buildings including the Supreme Court, calling for a military coup against Lula.\n\nHowever, his outsized role in Brazilian public life has come at a personal cost. Death threats have been made against Moraes and his family. Critics allege his methods imperil liberties. \u201cHe concentrates a lot of power [and] constantly tests the limits of his own authority,\u201d says Fernando Sch\u00fcler, a politics professor at Insper.\n\nMoraes\u2019s decision to freeze the Brazilian bank accounts of Musk\u2019s satellite company Starlink and issue a $8,900 daily fine for anyone using a virtual private network (VPN) to circumvent the X ban has been decried by some jurists as disproportionate. A survey by AtlasIntel found nearly 51 per cent of respondents disagreed with the X ban, versus just over 48 per cent in favour.\n\nIn the clash of egos between a tech billionaire and a steely Brazilian judge, it is difficult to envisage either conceding significant ground. But David Nemer, professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, says Moraes has sent a strong message: \u201c[He] has challenged Musk and the whole world has been watching. Brazil is showing he\u2019s not unbeatable.\u201d\n\nmichael.pooler@ft.com", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a193f687-e38c-48b0-9558-626584f17245"}}, {"id": "6bd5b388-3fbb-45ba-ae2c-1db8f226610a", "event_name": "Talk of a coming crackdown on social media companies is overblown", "blurb": "Brazil\u2019s X ban and Telegram founder\u2019s arrest are exceptions, not the rule", "date": "2024-09-0600:00:00.0", "body": "Is the political power of social networks (and their founders) past its peak? Politicians who feel they have been badly treated on social media or worry about a tide of misinformation might be tempted to think so, after two dramatic events that have dominated the tech headlines in the past couple of weeks. But I don\u2019t think this is the turning point some people are saying it is.\n\nThe two events in question were the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in France, and Brazil banning Elon Musk\u2019s X in an escalating fight over his refusal to remove accounts deemed to promote hate speech. It\u2019s tempting to think that it\u2019s getting harder for networks to carry illegal content with impunity.\n\nIn fact, Telegram and X have become outliers among social networks, whether for ideological reasons (they both have an absolutist attitude to free speech) or self-interest (they have fewer resources, which would make it hard to apply the kind of content moderation seen on other networks). Most social networks don\u2019t operate this way.\n\nIn their book Who Controls the Internet? the US academics Tim Wu and Jack Goldsmith pointed out nearly 20 years ago that governments clearly have the power through local laws to determine what happens online inside their countries. The only question is whether officials have a way to enforce those laws, through seizing assets or arresting the staff of uncooperative companies, or applying some other leverage.\n\nThe latest social media showdowns bear this out. Durov, who is based in Dubai, was arrested when his private jet touched down in France, putting himself within reach of authorities. Musk\u2019s confrontation with Brazil came to a head after he withdrew staff out of concern they\u2019d be arrested for not complying with Supreme Court orders (which the X owner alleged amounted to censorship). Brazil then shut down X for not obeying a law that requires it to have local representatives \u2014 an example of the so-called \u201chostage-taking laws\u201d that have become common over the past decade as more countries have tried to exert some power over internet companies based far away.\n\nOne wild card here is Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite network, which can beam its signals across national borders. Starlink said over the weekend that it wouldn\u2019t obey Brazil\u2019s order to block X in the country. But Musk has since backed down. Starlink\u2019s accounts in Brazil were frozen and it still needs local regulatory approval to sell its terminals inside the country \u2014 evidence that, whatever the appearances, it isn\u2019t beyond the reach of national law.\n\nWhat\u2019s notable about these cases is that they don\u2019t reflect the passage of new laws to clean up social networks or fresh determination by national politicians to exert their power. They\u2019re the result of an activist judiciary.\n\nAs the FT\u2019s John Thornhill points out in this Tech Tonic podcast, Durov\u2019s arrest was actually something of an embarrassment to President Emmanuel Macron, who had been angling to get Telegram to move its headquarters to France.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing particularly new about the issues in the Telegram case. It\u2019s accused of turning a blind eye to a wave of illegal material it has been hosting. This is little different to the attack on illegal music sites such as Napster and LimeWire two decades ago. As long as unlawful material like this remains on the \u201cdark web\u201d, it\u2019s hard to control. But once it lands on a site that is within the reach of law enforcement (and the FT\u2019s Hannah Murphy pointed out earlier this year that clearly applies to Telegram) then some kind of action becomes inevitable.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Supreme Court, meanwhile, is trying to apply standards of speech that are enshrined in the country\u2019s constitution. As in many democracies, hate speech in Brazil is considered illegal, unlike in the US. Inevitably, the issue has become a matter of vicious partisan politics, but it\u2019s inevitable that courts will try to draw the lines around what is legally permissible.\n\nMusk, with his penchant for conflict, is highly likely to march into more fights like this around the world. And any network that openly carries illegal material and refuses to co-operate with law enforcement, as Telegram is accused of doing, can expect similar treatment.\n\nBut most established social networks have learnt these lessons \u2014 and don\u2019t go out of their way to provoke a fight. If anything, they might have gone too far in the other direction, as evidenced by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s rather startling admission last week that Meta bowed to White House pressure to censor Covid-19 content during the pandemic. He claims he won\u2019t make the same mistake again, though the temptation will always be to accede to political influence like this.\n\nWhat do you think Rana, should we be seeing what\u2019s going on in Brazil and France as evidence of a new crackdown on social networks? And even if that\u2019s the case, what are the chances it will change what we see online?\n\nWho will win the 2024 presidential election?

I do think we are reaching\u00a0a tipping point, not in action per se but in understanding, and I see the big issue here as a square off between public and private power.\n\nPlatforms have done a very good job, as big banks before them did, of making the case that they are special and shouldn\u2019t be subject to the laws that other industries and individuals have to abide\u00a0by. And yet, as you point out, it\u2019s possible for platforms to do a better job moderating something like, say, hate speech if they do what everyone else does \u2014 employ people to do it. One key reason that margins are so huge in such firms is that they employ vastly fewer people relative to their market cap or revenue than either traditional media or previous generations of technology firms did. But that comes with risks and governments have a right to take action when the risks threaten their civil societies and democracies.\n\nAnd yet, there\u2019s another issue here, which is that even liberals in countries such as the US are still operating with a neoliberal understanding of the world. Consider, for example, the way in which liberal Supreme Court justices like Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan ruled in Moody vs. NetChoice. They vacated and sent back to lower courts state laws that sought to limit social media companies ability to edit how people communicate on their platforms. That approach essentially gives the platforms power over the state and the people. Private power trumping public power is one of the core problems of the neoliberal approach.\n\nNow, it\u2019s true that if you live in, say, Turkey or Iran, maybe you trust Google more than your government. But do I as an American citizen want to see private companies being given the power to make their own free speech rules rather than the state taking power to set those rules? No, I don\u2019t. I think it simply creates a tailwind for people like Elon Musk, who have way too much power as it is, to take more in ways that threaten liberty and civil society. All this is part of a larger issue, which is the rise of a kind of super capitalism that wants to be free from any public control, which Quinn Slobodian has written about so well in his book Crack Up Capitalism.\n\nI think that these platforms will ultimately have to become public utilities (if, like Google, they really are necessary for the public good, like water or electricity) and be subject to the same expectations as other regulated companies. If that means hiring actual content moderators is so uneconomical that it puts them out of business, so be it. I don\u2019t think the world would suffer if X went away.\n\nSo, I guess my answer to you is that while we haven\u2019t reached a clear silver bullet regulatory solution for how to put Big Tech in check, I think we are slowly but surely coming to understand the stakes here. They aren\u2019t detailed and technocratic (as the companies would like us to believe, since that creates complexity that allows them to obfuscate), but rather simple: do we want to go back to the 19th century, or would we prefer to live in a world in which nations can successfully curb the power of oligarchs?\n\nAnd now a word from our Swampians\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\n\nIn response to \u201cWhy the media has so much trouble covering the presidential election\u201d:\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t the idea when covering presidential candidates be objectivity?

Head of telecoms regulator Anatel, Carlos Baigorri, told local media that Starlink could lose its licence if it was confirmed to be failing to comply with Moraes\u2019s orders.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, however, the satellite internet provider backed down from further confrontation.\n\n\u201cFollowing last week\u2019s order from [Moraes] that froze Starlink\u2019s finances and prevents Starlink from conducting financial transactions in Brazil, we immediately initiated legal proceedings in the Brazilian Supreme Court explaining the gross illegality of this order and asking the court to unfreeze our assets,\u201d Starlink posted on X.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the illegal treatment of Starlink in freezing of our assets, we are complying with the order to block access to X in Brazil,\u201d it said.\n\nWith more than 225,000 users in Brazil, Starlink is not among Brazil\u2019s largest internet operators, but is considered a vital tool for communities in remote areas such as the Amazon and in the country\u2019s agricultural heartland.\n\nStarlink is the largest and most successful company of its kind. It operates more than 6,000 low-orbit satellites that beam internet connectivity to small dishes, allowing web access for previously hard-to-reach communities as well as aeroplanes and ships. The satellites are launched by SpaceX\u2019s reusable rockets, another space technology in which Musk has a near-monopoly.\n\nIn Brazil, meanwhile, the ban on X has divided people along political lines. Rightwing politicians have decried Moraes as an \u201cautocrat\u201d who is imperilling the country\u2019s liberties, while leftwing figures, including President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, have backed the ban as an important statement of Brazilian sovereignty.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian justice system may have given an important signal that the world is not obliged to put up with Musk\u2019s far-right anything-goes attitude just because he is rich,\u201d said Lula this week.\n\nAdditional reporting by Stephen Morris in London", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8789d9b8-a466-45c9-94b0-8e409683bb1e"}}, {"id": "3fe14e9d-2baa-420f-8474-2f2a9ff691f5", "event_name": "Brazilians flock to Bluesky after court bans Elon Musk\u2019s X", "blurb": "Platform registered almost 2mn new users after Supreme Court suspended bigger rival", "date": "2024-09-0300:00:00.0", "body": "Social media site Bluesky registered almost 2mn new users in just four days as Brazilians flocked to the platform following the suspension of Elon Musk\u2019s X by the country\u2019s Supreme Court.\n\nThe platform launched in 2019 by Jack Dorsey, one of X\u2019s co-founders, also topped the rankings of most popular apps on the Google and Apple stores in Brazil.\n\nThe surge in Bluesky\u2019s fortunes reflect the importance of social media in Brazil. More than 144mn people use at least one kind of platform and the nation frequently tops lists of countries that spend the most time online.\n\nIt also reflects the risks facing X from a prolonged ban in Brazil. With an estimated 20mn active users prior to the court order, the Latin American nation represented X\u2019s sixth-largest market and an important source of advertising revenue.\n\nThe order from Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes to ban X followed a months-long public feud between the top judge and Musk over accounts which appear to be linked to far-right groups.\n\nMusk has repeatedly and publicly criticised the judge over what he sees as censorship requests to remove or suspend accounts.

However, Bolsonaro\u2019s rightwing followers have alleged the judge curbed freedom of expression and unfairly targeted conservatives.\n\nA ban on X would place Brazil among a group of autocratic nations, such as North Korea and Venezuela, that also prohibit the platform.\n\nPresident Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has repeatedly sought to cast Musk as an out-of-touch billionaire. \u201cThere is clearly a far-right articulation in the world. [Musk] might be a piece of it,\u201d Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso, the current president of the Supreme Court, told the Financial Times in May. \u201cSome people invoke freedom of expression when truly they are defending a business model based on engagement and, unfortunately, hatred, sensationalism [and] conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nSeparately on Thursday, Starlink, Musk\u2019s satellite network, posted that it had received an order from de Moraes earlier this week freezing its finances and blocking it from conducting financial transactions in Brazil.\n\nLocal press have reported that the decision to block Starlink accounts in Brazil was part of an attempt to collect fines levied on X for failing to comply with court orders.\n\nMusk, who also runs Tesla and SpaceX, has increasingly weighed in on foreign politics through the platform he bought for $44bn, championing rightwing politicians globally while attacking leftwing leaders.\n\nEarlier this month, he criticised the UK prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, for his handling of anti-immigrant rioting and started a war of words with Venezuela\u2019s President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.

It was unclear how many staff it had in the region.\n\nMusk posted on X: \u201cNo question that Moraes needs to leave. Having a \u2018justice\u2019 who repeatedly and egregiously violates the law is no justice at all.\u201d\n\nThe high-profile intervention ratchets up the tension between the supreme court and Musk, a clash that has become emblematic of the billionaire entrepreneur\u2019s recent weigh-ins on foreign politics through the platform he bought for $44bn.\n\nIn recent years, Musk, a self-declared free speech absolutist, has increasingly sided with rightwing politicians globally, throwing his support behind Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and championing Argentina\u2019s populist leader Javier Milei.\n\nThis has intensified recently, with Musk attacking the UK government for its handling of anti-immigrant rioting, and trading barbs with Venezuela\u2019s President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, resulting in the platform being blocked in the country by the authoritarian socialist for 10 days.\n\nWhile Musk\u2019s commentary has won him fans among Brazil\u2019s conservatives, some lawmakers and analysts fear his interventions could stoke unrest.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX chief first took aim at de Moraes earlier this year over the supreme court\u2019s request to take down what are believed to be rightwing accounts, and called on the judge to \u201cresign or be impeached\u201d.\n\nIn response, de Moraes ordered an investigation into Musk \u2014 who threatened to disobey the court orders \u2014 for suspected obstruction of justice. Musk reignited the spat this week by repeating claims of censorship, after X\u2019s government affairs account posted a document purportedly sent by de Moraes ordering the platform to block certain users.\n\nDe Moraes has spearheaded a judicial crackdown against online disinformation, but is a controversial figure who divides opinion in Latin America\u2019s largest democracy.\n\nSupporters say he helped secure democracy in the face of attacks on the reliability of the country\u2019s electronic voting system by former president Jair Bolsonaro, ahead of his unsuccessful re-election campaign in 2022. However, followers of the hard-right populist allege the judge has curbed freedom of expression and unfairly targeted conservatives.\n\nBrazil\u2019s supreme court has faced discontent from the far-right movement and been accused of over-reach by critics. Its premises were among the government buildings ransacked in January 2023 by radical Bolsonaro backers who claimed, without evidence, that the election result was rigged in favour of winner Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened that we have been forced to make this decision. The responsibility lies solely with Alexandre de Moraes,\u201d X said on Saturday. \u201cHis actions are incompatible with democratic government.

They detonated explosives to damage the materials and a clandestine airstrip, then set alight the 2,000 litres of fuel, sending plumes of black smoke above the tree canopies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re able to move quickly, but the losses will hit them hard and make it difficult to come back,\u201d said one of the dozen soldiers on the seize and destroy operation close to the Venezuelan border.\n\nThis is the front line of Brazil\u2019s battle against destructive wildcat mining in the country\u2019s largest indigenous reserve, a remote expanse the size of Portugal that is home to a tribe still relatively isolated from the outside world.\n\nIllicit gold extraction is a multibillion-dollar industry globally, which is associated with a raft of ecological harms and human rights violations as it caters for voracious worldwide demand for the precious metal.\n\nIn Brazil it expanded under far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, who was accused by campaigners of giving a green light to illegal miners, loggers and cattle ranchers in the Amazon.\n\nMore than half of the country\u2019s estimated gold production in 2021 \u2014 some 53 tonnes, worth about $2.5bn \u2014 showed evidence of illegality, with some likely to have ended up in jewellery stores overseas, according to non-profit Instituto Escolhas.\n\nIn a sharp policy reversal, protecting the tropical rainforest and its people were totemic pledges of current president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. \u201cThe Brazilian government will remove and end mining on any indigenous land from now on,\u201d he said shortly after taking office at the start of 2023.\n\nWithin weeks, his administration launched emergency security and health actions in the Yanomami territory, where trespassing miners were blamed for a crisis of disease and hunger among its 28,000 inhabitants. But after initial success expelling many intruders, they began to reappear.\n\nThat prompted Bras\u00edlia to make a renewed push in the reserve earlier this year, permanently deploying federal police and military personnel as part of a multi-agency force.\n\n\u201cLast year, there would be operations for a period of time, [like] 10 or 15 days. Today, we\u2019re trying to undertake anti-mining actions every day,\u201d said Nilton Tubino, head of the task force, whose budget of R$1.2bn ($220mn) for 2024 is several times its budget under Bolsonaro, said the government. \u201cWe have to make their activities so expensive that it no longer pays.\u201d\n\nAgents have destroyed boats, small planes and machinery, and have seized almost 11 tonnes of gold since the end of February. Close to 1,200 enforcement missions have taken place; medical posts have been reopened and two new support bases built by the military.\n\nAccess to the territory is mainly by air. The mission in the Xite\u00ed region involved a 300km helicopter flight across dense, hilly jungle, starting in Boa Vista, capital of Roraima state.\n\nThe soldiers, national guardsmen and environmental officers landed at a makeshift support site for a mine.\n\nThere they also discovered \u2014 and discarded \u2014 dozens of heavy sacks of cassiterite, an ore of tin \u2014 mineral critical to the energy transition. It is increasingly extracted by illegal miners alongside gold, according to enforcement agents.\n\n\u201cIt was ready for dispatch. You can see from the runway there was activity here only a few hours ago,\u201d said one of the agents, speaking on condition of anonymity as a few indigenous villagers looked on from a distance. \u201cToday was a success, but there\u2019s a lot more challenges ahead.\u201d\n\nOfficials claim they are containing the spread of new mining sites, with alerts in the territory down by three-quarters in the first half of 2024 from a year earlier. But Jorge Eduardo Dantas, of Greenpeace, said: \u201cDespite the reduction, we can still see new areas being opened up.\u201d\n\nThe miners use evasion tactics ranging from working at night to spreading out their camps. Internet satellite communications via Starlink devices allow advance warnings of incoming raids. Supply flights are increasingly launched from Venezuela, say officials.\n\nAuthorities are also trying to dismantle the illicit networks and logistics behind the mines. Federal police have requested court approval to seize R$2bn of proceeds from the trade, said detective Caio Luchini.\n\n\u201cWhen you attack the financial side of a criminal organisation, you take away its fuel,\u201d he said. A motor, he said, could cost R$120,000 to buy, transport and assemble. \u201cOur daily challenge in investigations is to trace the movement of money and block it.\u201d\n\nSmall-scale artisanal mining for gold and other minerals, known as garimpo, is often unauthorised and nearly doubled in Brazil\u2019s protected areas between 2018 and 2022, according to non-profit initiative MapBiomas. Bolsonaro came to power in 2019.\n\nIn the Yanomami land, it expanded by the equivalent of 2,500 soccer pitches in 2022, according to an analysis of satellite images by an indigenous association. That was a 54 per cent increase on the year before.\n\nThe miners cut clearings into forest, dig ponds to dredge for gold and dump mercury used in extraction into rivers. At the peak there were 20,000 trespassers, whose presence spread malaria and malnutrition among the Yanomami, leading to high infant mortality, said health workers, officials and activists.\n\nThere have also been reports of intimidation and violence in the Yanomani territory. In its Surucucu region, indigenous leader J\u00fanior Hekurari said miners groomed youngsters to collaborate and sowed divisions in communities.\n\nHe said the government was \u201con the right track\u201d, but warned there was a long way to go. \u201cIt\u2019s very recent. The Yanomami people are still in grief. The water we drink is polluted. Our food doesn\u2019t flow because they also ruined the land. They left many holes with stagnant water, which breeds mosquitoes.\u201d\n\nToday there are an estimated 80 per cent fewer miners in the territory than in 2022, said Est\u00eav\u00e3o Senra, a researcher at the non-profit Instituto Socioambiental.\n\nBut he added that after years of underfunding, enforcement on Yanomami land required \u201cmore equipment and more manpower\u201d. \u201cIt encapsulates the challenge of protecting the Brazilian Amazon.\u201d\n\nThe crackdown divides opinion in Boa Vista, the heart of Brazil\u2019s most geographically isolated state, which suffered huge forest fires this year. A statue of a gold prospector panning stands in front of the governor\u2019s palace, displaying the role of garimpo in Roraima\u2019s history.\n\nBoa Vista resident Giliard, who declined to give his full name, worked as a wildcat miner, or garimpeiro, for a decade and said it paid well.\n\nBut he has not returned for two years because of safety concerns, after colleagues were killed during raids. Authorities acknowledge some of their interventions have turned into armed confrontations, though they say most have not.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t criminals, we are workers,\u201d Giliard said. \u201cLula is persecuting garimpeiros. Bolsonaro let us work. We want a legalised area to work in.\u201d\n\nGathered at his home, fellow miners deny causing ecological harm. They insist they provide indigenous people with clothing, food and even basic medical treatment.\n\nSupporters of garimpo argue that indigenous reserves \u2014 which cover 14 per cent of national territory \u2014 are excessively large, given that indigenous people account for less than one in 100 Brazilians.\n\nThe illegal trade is important for the local economy, said locals in Boa Vista. The impact of the downturn is felt in a district known as \u201cGold Street\u201d.\n\nBusiness has dropped sharply at the jewellery workshop that Neude Araujo Gomes runs with her husband. She said it was harder to get hold of the precious metal now. Some of their rivals have shut down.\n\n\u201cIn Roraima, work comes from garimpo or the government. There aren\u2019t big factories or companies,\u201d she added. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just gold shops that are affected but commerce as a whole. We have to hope that [garimpo] starts up again.\u201d\n\nFor indigenous rights campaigners, that gold is stained with Yanomami blood. Field operatives and activists warn that a lasting state presence is needed.\n\n\u201cIt will take 10, 15 years for the Yanomami people to return to normality,\u201d said J\u00fanior. \u201cOur fear is that when these operations end and Lula\u2019s task force leaves, all the garimpeiros will return.\u201d\n\nCartography and data visualisation by Steven Bernard", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5eb64108-3181-4352-804e-aca76e1be505"}}, {"id": "bf92a82e-0a0a-4085-b26c-fae0fccee546", "event_name": "Inside the hidden Modernist houses of S\u00e3o Paulo", "blurb": "Aberto, a new annual art show staged amid the fragile remnants of the city\u2019s architectural legacy, opens up striking unseen interiors", "date": "2024-08-0600:00:00.0", "body": "The best Modernist houses are usually not in cities. The sculptural Brutalist compositions, the sleek villas and the glass boxes tend to dot the exurban edges or the open countryside; places with space and land, views and a little seclusion. Except in one city, that is, one of the biggest \u2014 S\u00e3o Paulo. Here the most astonishing houses punctuate the urban fabric, popping up in unexpected places, down tight streets, lurking amid remnants of rainforest, visible occasionally from the always-encroaching high-rises but unnoticeable from the streets.\n\nThe explosive growth of S\u00e3o Paulo in the late 20th century meant that it swallowed up its edges, rapaciously ingesting its legacy of Modernist houses so that many now find themselves deep inside the city itself. And what houses they are. Perhaps no other city has such an astounding layer of experimental, uplifting, inventive, challenging, often brilliant dwellings from the 1960s and 1970s. The problem, though, is twofold. First, they are fast disappearing under a carpet of new apartment blocks. Second, it can be very difficult to find and see those that do survive.\n\nAn annual art event, however, is aiming to both raise consciousness of this legacy and expose those incredible and mostly unseen interiors to a more public view. And it has become a much-anticipated happening in the art-conscious city that boasts the second longest-running biennial after Venice.\n\nAberto (\u201cOpen\u201d) was founded by Filipe Assis, a S\u00e3o Paulo resident and art adviser who spotted an opening to simultaneously raise awareness of the fragility of this architectural legacy while also exhibiting art and design in dramatic, unforgettable settings. For this year\u2019s edition, two houses associated with S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Asian diaspora \u2014 and two influential women in Brazilian culture \u2014 are being opened up. One is the home of artist Tomie Ohtake, the other once belonged to the lesser-known but nevertheless remarkable architect Chu Ming Silveira.\n\nOver coffee in London\u2019s King's Cross, I asked Assis about the origins \u2014 and the ambitions \u2014 of Aberto. \u201cIt started in 2022 when [design writer and entrepreneur] Lissa Carmona found this house designed by Oscar Niemeyer in S\u00e3o Paulo and told me about it. I said, \u2018What Niemeyer house?\u2019 I\u2019d never heard of it. So we contacted the owners to see if they\u2019d be willing to do something with us and it went from there.\u201d\n\nNiemeyer, of course, is the totemic Brazilian architect, the man most associated with the country\u2019s reinvention as a Modernist powerhouse \u2014 the designer of key government buildings in the new capital of Bras\u00edlia but also monumental structures such as the vast, S-curved Copan building and Ibirapuera Park in S\u00e3o Paulo. But he had only accepted a very few commissions for private houses, so the discovery of his only home for the city, a 1962 design featuring his characteristic undulating roof, organically curving spaces and a lush, tropical garden, felt like a coup.\n\nMore importantly, Aberto offered an opportunity to see artworks from Brazil\u2019s golden age of Modernism set against their natural habitat; the fluid spaces, concrete walls and supercool mid-century modern of a now much-admired era. That first edition in Niemeyer\u2019s dramatic house even featured a rare painting by the architect himself, a striking Surrealist allegory of Brazil\u2019s descent in dictatorship entitled \u201cRuins of Bras\u00edlia\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe initially thought it would be a one-off event,\u201d Assis tells me, \u201can experiment. Having Niemeyer as a first was obvious, but then it seemed to make sense to have Artigas next.\u201d\n\nVilanova Artigas, the architect\u2019s architect and a genius of the concrete sublime, designer of the school of architecture at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (perhaps, the greatest concrete structure I have ever encountered), was a huge figure in Brazilian Modernism, though he remains far less known than, say, Niemeyer or Lina Bo Bardi. His 1974 house, chosen to accommodate Aberto\u2019s second edition, perfectly illustrated why that influence has been so enduring; a complex, theatrical composition that is as much sculpture as architecture, a three-dimensional chess game in space and mass.\n\nThis year sees a shift, from arguably Brazilian Modernism\u2019s two great male figures to two less-recognised but also pivotal female figures.\n\nThe first is the house of Ohtake, one of Brazil\u2019s most enduring and successful artists. Born in Kyoto in 1913, Ohtake was travelling in Brazil when the second world war erupted in the Pacific and got stuck. One of her two sons, Ruy Ohtake (1938-2021) went on to become an architect, best known for the curved, portholed-concrete hulk of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Hotel Unique. It was Ruy who designed her house and studio in 1969-70.\n\nWhen I visited the house in the Campo Belo neighbourhood about 15 years ago, Tomie was still busily active, working away at a big desk in the centre of the house, the concrete walls studded with small, vivid canvases while big, sculptural pieces that looked like they\u2019d been drawn with some weird 3D marker pen swirled through the spaces. Its walls are concrete, so you might think it would be a grey, austere space, a monkish mix of Japanese minimalism and Brazilian Brutalism \u2014 but it is exactly the opposite.\n\nThere are bold splashes of primary colour, Mondrian-style, on the surfaces. And the studio, which is surmounted by an eye-shaped oculus, looks out on to a garden and pool, the light from which flickers back inside. The whole house is infused with quotes from other architects, little details half-remembered; there are concrete rainwater spouts that might be straight from Le Corbusier; wavy parapets \u00e0 la Niemeyer (whose wonderful rocking lounger also featured inside, I seem to remember) and there is built-in concrete furniture and blocky bulkheads which evoke the work of Marcel Breuer.\n\nIt\u2019s a common complaint that these kinds of concrete structures make difficult spaces for display; you can\u2019t exactly screw into the walls to hang pictures. Other surfaces might be of glass, or are undulating or exposed to natural light and fresh air. But Breuer\u2019s building for the Whitney in New York, so successfully adopted by the Met, the Frick and now Sotheby\u2019s, shows that for modern art, brutal is often best. After all, Lina Bo Bardi\u2019s MASP in S\u00e3o Paulo, one of the world\u2019s great Modernist museums, solved the problem by displaying pictures on perspex stands, visible from all around in a brilliant landscape of art.\n\nIn Ohtake\u2019s former home, her own vivid pieces sparkle against the concrete walls; other works, too, suddenly seem to make sense. Artists have built and inhabited these spaces and other artists are enthusiastic about responding to them. Here a \u201cchoreographed\u201d (rather than just curated \u2014 these are works in space, after all) selection of art and design will aim to show both the works and the setting to full effect.\n\nThis year, two houses feature in Aberto for the first time. The other is quite close to Ohtake\u2019s and was designed \u2014 for herself \u2014 by Chu Ming Silveira (1941-97), an architect I only recently discovered while researching a book on street furniture. Born to a wealthy family in Shanghai, Silveira fled with them to Hong Kong after the communist advance, eventually settling in S\u00e3o Paulo. She became a designer for the Brazilian Telephonic Company, where she created her most familiar work, the 1971 \u201cOrelh\u00e3o\u201d (big ear). This was a big plastic egg which acted as a phone booth (acknowledging a climate inhospitable to enclosed glass booths) and which became a familiar and beloved fixture of Brazil\u2019s streetscapes, as recognisable as London\u2019s red phone boxes but imbued with Brazilian modernity.\n\nHer house in the Morumbi neighbourhood, which she designed and built in the early 1970s, is U-shaped and wraps around a tropical garden and pool while its interior is dominated by a huge concrete fireplace descending from the ceiling like something from an industrial forge.\n\nDesigner and Aberto curator Claudia Moreira Salles says: \u201cThese homes offer an unexpected intimacy\u201d; they were \u201cinspired by oriental designs with low ceilings that enhance engagement with the art\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Our curation carefully uses architectural elements \u2014 openings, angles and natural light \u2014 to place artworks, transforming each house into a canvas for an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nOne display includes works by Anna Maria Maiolino, recently awarded the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the Venice Biennale; Pop feminist Wanda Pimentel, showing female body parts melding into domestic interiors; and two other Brazilian women artists, Lygia Clark and Lygia Pape.\n\nWe have become used to seeing art in the white cube, the clinical, neutral box, or against the generic white walls of the global art fair. Aberto promises something very different. Assis tells me: \u201cIt is so sad to see many of [these homes] being knocked down. S\u00e3o Paulo is always changing but we could say it is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009not getting more beautiful. We wanted to bring awareness to these houses and to the intimate relationship between architecture, art and design.

The ecosystem is considered a bulwark against climate change because it absorbs and stores vast amounts of carbon.\n\nBut non-governmental organisations have long complained about the behaviour of some project developers towards local and indigenous communities in their attempts to secure land.\n\nBrazil\u2019s leftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has made the environment a priority following a surge in Amazon deforestation under his predecessor, rightwing populist Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThe country\u2019s federal police arrested five people and executed dozens of search warrants in June as part of a probe into the suspected irregular sale of carbon credits worth an estimated R$180mn ($32mn).\n\nInvestigators claim the decade-long conspiracy resulted in the misappropriation of 538,000 hectares of public land \u2014 more than three times the size of Greater London. It involved the bribing of officials, falsification of property deeds and illegal logging, according to police.\n\nBuyers of the credits included multinational companies and they are being treated as possible victims, said police.\n\nSilva said the authorities were working to stamp out such unlawful practices.\n\n\u201cWe already have a series of crimes involving land grabbing, logging, illegal gold mining and now on top we have this category. We are very attentive \u2014 both the federal police and environmental agencies \u2014 because it is unacceptable to have yet another front for crime.\u201d\n\nThe projects under suspicion operated within the so-called voluntary carbon market, where the use of credits is not legally required or regulated by government.\n\nDraft legislation is before Brazil\u2019s congress to create a mandatory carbon system that would force polluters in the country to reduce emissions or buy credits to compensate.\u00a0\u201cWe hope [the bill] will be approved as soon as possible, precisely to prevent this type of crime,\u201d added Silva.\n\nThe creation of a regulated carbon market should help reduce fraud, said Caroline Dihl Prolo, head of climate stewardship at investment firm fama re.capital, because companies required to control their emissions will also be able to buy credits from the voluntary market up to a certain limit.\n\n\u201cTo do so, those voluntary credits will have to meet rules yet to be determined by the government for the regulated market. In practice, that should set an effective floor for standards across both segments,\u201d said Dihl Prolo.\n\nCritics argue the climate impact of Brazil\u2019s carbon market proposals may be limited as they do not cover its booming agricultural sector, responsible for a quarter of national emissions.\n\nVerra, the largest accreditation body for voluntary offsets, has launched a formal review into the three projects implicated in the police investigation and has suspended the issuance of credits to them pending its outcome.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ea246444-7bd4-4d1f-8bf0-8adcd3a7eba4"}}, {"id": "8b05c4c9-dad4-4e04-b9bd-2e8b69115820", "event_name": "Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea and Margareth Menezes, Barbican review \u2014 joyful Afro-Brazilian beats heat up London summer", "blurb": "Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea brought samba rhythms and carnival fervour, while Menezes had a powerful, majestic presence", "date": "2024-07-2900:00:00.0", "body": "On a blustery English summer evening, the tropical heat of South America\u2019s largest nation filled London\u2019s Barbican Centre with a double bill of Afro-Brazilian music: both Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea and Margareth Menezes are from Salvador, Bahia, in Brazil\u2019s north-east.\n\nIl\u00ea Aiy\u00ea originally took shape as a carnival block \u2014 the name given to bands who, mixing Brazilian rhythms with chants, mobilise crowds on the streets \u2014 and their seven male percussionists took the stage beating out furious samba rhythms. They were soon joined by male and female vocalists, then two female dancers began gliding across the stage. Dressed in golden robes, Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea performed with such uplifting energy that the Barbican\u2019s formal concert hall was transformed into a street party, the largely Brazilian audience joyously dancing throughout the venue.\n\nFounded in 1974, the ensemble initially called their block Poder Negro (Black Power), which brought problems with Salvador\u2019s predominantly white police force. They then became Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea \u2014 one meaning in Yoruba is \u201cour earth\u201d \u2014 and focused on empowering Black Brazilians, not just through song and dance but by emphasising self-worth and African heritage. This determination to honour both the ancestors and their community shone through as Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea\u2019s dynamic blend of hard polyrhythms and supple, sweet voices proved exciting and intoxicating \u2014 here was a taste of Bahia\u2019s carnival fervour.\n\nAfter the interval, Margareth Menezes took the stage backed by a drummer, two percussionists, guitar, bass and keyboards. The singer appeared unconcerned about matching the wild party spirit that had ignited the evening, her powerful voice and majestic presence ensuring the audience sat and listened \u2014 at least initially. Menezes broke through in Brazil in the 1980s and came close to winning international fame in 1989 when a song of hers appeared on the soundtrack of Wild Orchid, a trashy Mickey Rourke sexploitation film. Island Records issued a Menezes compilation and US and European club DJs embraced Menezes\u2019 ax\u00e9 sound, ax\u00e9 being a Salvadorean fusion of Afro-Brazilian rhythms and other musical genres.\n\nCrossover success did not follow, Menezes instead enjoying a long, successful career at home. She is now minister of culture in Brazil\u2019s government (the tropicalista singer Gilberto Gil occupied this position in President Lula\u2019s previous government). Menezes\u2019 music is built on samba rhythms but draws on myriad influences \u2014 one song had a jazz-funk flavour reminiscent of Level 42, while another employed a U2-ish guitar motif. Looking resplendent in a flowing black and white robe, she sang her hits, several of which had the audience joining in, while slowly turning up the rhythmic heat.\n\nThis well-paced performance ensured Menezes also got the audience up and dancing. Finishing on a high, she welcomed Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea back for a showstopping samba celebration as the ensemble partied across the stage.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nbarbican.org.uk", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/44a74163-655f-4ba7-829f-f2196c6558cb"}}, {"id": "e97ebc15-cb76-4c51-afa3-a5309a8e2041", "event_name": "\u2018A tightening siege\u2019: Brazil police close the net on Jair Bolsonaro", "blurb": "From \u2018jewel case\u2019 to spying, former president faces multiple allegations of corruption and abuse of power", "date": "2024-07-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Onstage at a conservative political rally earlier this month, Jair Bolsonaro struck a defiant tone, telling a raucous crowd he would not back down in the face of multiple police investigations into his alleged misconduct in office.\n\n\u201cDespite the federal police going to my house and my children\u2019s houses three times and the 300 or so cases I am facing, it has been worth it,\u201d he told the cheering audience. \u201cWe are not going to back down.\u201d\n\nBut the stirring rhetoric masked the hard-right former president\u2019s increasingly perilous legal position. For the past several weeks, federal police \u2014 Brazil\u2019s equivalent of the FBI \u2014 have been releasing details about the former president\u2019s time in power.\n\nAmong the more sensational are allegations that he embezzled luxury gifts worth more than $1mn and that his administration created a parallel spy agency to monitor political opponents.\n\nCommenting on the spying claims, the office of Brazil\u2019s attorney-general this month said the espionage set-up \u201crepresented only one cell of a broader criminal organisation\u201d.\n\nPolice are also expected in the coming weeks to recommend charges against Bolsonaro for his involvement in an alleged coup plot following the election of leader Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2022.\n\nBolsonaro, a former army captain who was president from 2019 to 2022, has denied wrongdoing in all the cases and has sought to frame the investigations as political persecution \u2014 a message that has resonated with his Christian nationalist base.\n\nBut crime experts and political analysts see a careful police strategy of drip-feeding revelations to maximise pressure on the former president, while preventing him from becoming a political martyr.\n\n\u201cWe have [several] very complicated cases and the way they are being conducted is creating a tightening siege around Bolsonaro,\u201d said Leandro Consentino, a political scientist and professor at Insper in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nRafael Alcadipani, a crime expert at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, said the drip-feeding of information was an \u201cinvestigation strategy that the federal police have chosen\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is a very competent police force that has a track record with these types of cases,\u201d he said. He recalled how police investigators built public pressure against politicians by selectively releasing information during the \u201cCar Wash\u201d corruption investigation \u2014 a decade-old, years-long probe into a bribery scheme between politicians and business leaders.\n\nPressure on the 69-year-old former leader began building in March this year when police recommended he be indicted for allegedly forging his Covid-19 vaccine certificate. Investigators claim he did this during the pandemic in order to travel to the US, which had strict entry requirements at the time.\n\nThen, earlier this month, police said they were recommending another indictment, this time over the so-called \u201cjewels case\u201d.\n\nThey claim the former leader received luxury gifts \u2014 including a Rolex watch, cufflinks and gold-plated ornaments \u2014 from Gulf state dignitaries and did not disclose them officially. He then allegedly dispatched aides on government planes to try to sell the goods in the US.\n\nDays after the claims \u2014 which political opponents were quick to call corruption \u2014 police revealed details about how Brazil\u2019s national intelligence agency created a parallel structure to spy on Bolsonaro\u2019s political opponents during his administration. Among dozens allegedly targeted were supreme court justices, the speaker of the lower house of Congress, and prominent journalists.\n\nPolice also claimed the spy agency sought to impede investigations into the former president\u2019s son, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, a senator who had been accused of embezzling public money. The case against Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro was subsequently rejected by a court after much of the evidence was annulled over procedural mis-steps.\n\nIn both the jewels and vaccine certificate cases, federal prosecutors must now decide whether to formally indict Bolsonaro. The allegations of spying \u2014 as well as separate claims that he conspired with senior military officers to try to overturn the 2022 election results \u2014 are awaiting further investigation by federal police.\n\n\u201cGiven the volume of issues, it will undoubtedly cause political damage to Bolsonaro,\u201d said Consentino.\n\nAlcadipani said the accumulation of investigations and evidence made it almost certain Bolsonaro would be arrested.\n\nThe former president has been barred from running for political office until 2030 since the electoral court in June last year convicted him of abusing his presidential powers and misusing official media in the run-up to the 2022 polls.\n\nBolsonaro has used this ban, as well as the mounting police investigations, to claim he is being politically persecuted \u2014 a tactic that analysts say keeps his base mobilised.\n\n\u201cIt is an effective way to maintain support, especially among his most loyal followers. [But] it is not a strategy that will somehow increase his popularity,\u201d said Rafael Cortez, a partner at consultancy Tend\u00eancias.\n\nBolsonaro has long attracted comparisons with Donald Trump, another rightwing politician facing multiple legal cases that the former US president claims are a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. Bolsonaro said this month he hopes Trump will be returned to the White House in November polls; he has also compared this month\u2019s assassination attempt on the US Republican with the stabbing he himself suffered on the campaign trail in 2018.\n\nDespite the legal maelstrom, Bolsonaro appears to be maintaining popular support among right-leaning voters, a development that has been attributed to the country\u2019s entrenched polarisation.\n\nIn March polling by Paran\u00e1 Pesquisas found him to be slightly more popular than Lula, with 37.1 per cent support against Lula\u2019s 35.3 per cent, though the difference was within the margin of error.\n\nBolsonaro only narrowly lost the 2022 election and in recent months has been touring the country, lending rhetorical support to political allies ahead of October\u2019s local elections.\n\nHe has become close to Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas, the rightwing governor of S\u00e3o Paulo state, who is widely tipped to contest presidential polls in 2026.\n\nAnalysts believe that \u2014 if combined with a potential friendly Trump presidency in the US \u2014 a de Freitas victory in Brazil could dramatically reduce the political and legal pressure on Bolsonaro.\n\nLocal media have also reported that several family members, including his wife Michelle and sons, are considering running for the senate in 2026. If they succeed, this would also boost the former president\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cThere is still hope,\u201d said Michelle Bolsonaro at the conservative rally earlier this month. \u201cThe right is fostering leaders to lead our country, which is so blessed but is just being mismanaged.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/daf3a1f6-6374-4456-b704-b946c9577bae"}}, {"id": "c729f076-de3d-4e4a-b202-d701a445fe71", "event_name": "Venezuelan migrants build a life in Brazil and dream of home", "blurb": "With elections due this month, few expats expect Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime to change   ", "date": "2024-07-1800:00:00.0", "body": "On the menu at Sabor Venezolano is the national dish of pabell\u00f3n \u2014 rice, beans, shredded beef and plantain \u2014 washed down with bottles of Polar, the South American country\u2019s most popular brand of beer.\u00a0Diners cheer on Venezuela\u2019s football team against Mexico in the Copa Am\u00e9rica tournament on a television screen in the small restaurant \u2014 just a handful of tables down the side of a house.\n\nThe location is not in Venezuela, however, but a city in one of the remotest corners of Brazil. The capital of Roraima state, Boa Vista hosts tens of thousands of Venezuelans who have fled economic ruin and repression under the socialist rule of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\n\u201cFor the first few years I cried, wanting to go back to my home, but now I\u2019ve adapted,\u201d says Maria Patricia, a 34-year-old mother of two, who with her husband runs the eatery on top of a full-time job.\n\nMostly situated above the equator, Roraima is Brazil\u2019s northernmost and least inhabited state. It is geographically isolated from the rest of the country, filled by Amazon rainforest, savannah, hills and indigenous lands.\n\nYet its population registered the highest proportional growth at the last census in 2022, up 41 per cent to 636,000. A key factor is believed to be migration from its northern neighbour, mostly via the main crossing between the two countries 200km upstate from Boa Vista.\n\nAhead of Venezuelan elections this month, some guests in the city dream of returning to their homeland. At her streetside stall selling everything from socks and scissors to belts and umbrellas, Joismar Martin, 21, displays the enterprise of many Venezuelans here.\u00a0She came as a teenager with her late mother and stepfather, and intends to move back after completing an odontology course. She has bought a three-bedroom home in Caracas \u2014\u00a0for just $1,000 \u2014 and plans to set up a business there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m praying that God puts the right person in charge to change things. Will it happen? I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s so much corruption with this government,\u201d she says.\n\nMore than half a million Venezuelans are in Brazil, out of a total 7.7mn overseas. A programme run by public authorities, the UN, armed forces and charities provides shelters, medical attention and helps new arrivals find work and resettle in other parts of the country. \u201cIt is a true ecosystem of social protection, as well as inclusion and economic integration,\u201d lieutenant colonel Magno Lopes tells me at a massive processing centre in Boa Vista. Although the daily flow of people crossing the border has fallen, it is still around 350, he adds. Life remains tough for many though, with rough sleeping visible in central Boa Vista.\n\nBegging for change, Mary Algare\u0301s, 43, says she cannot work due to injury after being shot at an anti-government protest in Venezuela two years ago. The nurse lives in a one-bedroom studio with her two daughters and three grandchildren, but praises the welcome she found in Brazil.\u00a0\u201cThere is healthcare, welfare and I have applied for a disability pension.\u201d\n\nThe influx of migrants has left a mark on Boa Vista, from the Spanish spoken in supermarkets to a calypso street procession held in March. \u201cThe culture and musicality has changed,\u201d says Julhy Van Den Berg at Ref\u00fagio 343, a non-profit that runs Brazilian Portuguese language classes and connects migrant jobseekers to employers.\n\nBut in private, it is not uncommon to hear complaints about occasional xenophobia, while some locals grumble about the impact on jobs and the cost of living.\u00a0\u201cVenezuelan labour is much cheaper,\u201d one cab driver tells me. \u201cIt will be better for everyone if they remove Maduro from power\u201d.\n\nAt Sabor Venezolano, Maria Patricia reflects a common view among expatriates that the autocrat has rigged the institutions and would not accept a possible defeat.\n\nHowever, she holds some hope. She mentions how Brazil\u2019s leftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 a longtime ally of Maduro \u2014 earlier this year criticised the blocking of an opposition candidate.\u00a0\u201cEven though it was little, it was important.

The logistical costs of holding the vote are funded separately through the electoral court.\n\nThe allocation is more than double the BR$2bn assigned to campaigning for the local races in 2020, and is equal to the total spent on presidential, gubernatorial and state assembly elections combined in 2022.\n\nThe BR$4.9bn exceeds the BR$3.7bn annual budget for Brazil\u2019s environment ministry, which, among other things, is responsible for stopping illegal deforestation, gold mining and land grabs in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nIt comes at a time when the Brazilian government is under intense pressure to cut costs amid rising market concerns over the country\u2019s fiscal trajectory.\n\nThe ballooning budget for funding campaign activities across Brazil\u2019s 5,500 municipalities has become another example of congressional lawmakers and politicians claiming large sums from the public purse, which critics and analysts say has empowered parliament at the expense of the presidency. There are also concerns over transparency and how the funds are used.\n\n\u201cThe balance of power has shifted in favour of Congress,\u201d said Bruno Carazza, a professor at the Dom Cabral Foundation. \u201cCongressmen nowadays depend less on the president to provide pork barrel [funding] for their local constituencies.\u201d\n\nLawmakers have defended the allocation as part of the democratic process. Zeca Dirceu from Lula\u2019s leftwing Workers\u2019 party, said last year: \u201cThe electoral fund resources are essential in the exercise of democracy. We are talking about 0.2 per cent of the country\u2019s revenue. So it\u2019s reasonable. And municipal elections are very expensive and important for democracy.\u201d\n\nAnother example of parliamentarians\u2019 growing clout is their control of the public budget via the allocation of discretionary stipends that are used to invest in their constituencies.\n\nIn the past, allocation of these funds was largely at the discretion of the executive. Lawmakers, however, have seized on various moments of government weakness over the past decade to give themselves the power to allocate funds.\n\nToday, lawmakers have the right to add stipends worth millions of dollars to the federal budget \u2014 and payment is obligatory.\n\nUnder the Lula government, these payments amount to about 22 per cent of the government\u2019s discretionary budget or about $8bn annually, according to data from consultancy Prospectiva. Under the previous administration of Jair Bolsonaro, the stipends were worth about 33 per cent of the discretionary budget.\n\n\u201cCongress\u2019s control over budget spending has greatly increased [in the past decade]. This gives it autonomy,\u201d said Marina Pontes, a political analyst at Prospectiva.\n\n\u201cThe stipends are constitutionally provided for. The problem is not the mechanism, but the dimension it has assumed.\u201d\n\nLula has expressed exasperation over the situation, which reduces the ability of the leftwing president to negotiate with Brazil\u2019s rightwing-dominated Congress.\n\n\u201cThe naked truth is that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Congress became too empowered,\u201d said the president in a radio interview last month. \u201cThe executive has become weakened in the art of exercising the budget. This is concrete and the whole world knows it.\u201d\n\nThe local elections are set to take place over two rounds in October and will elect mayors and city councils. The polls are typically seen as a bellwether for the president\u2019s popularity.\n\nBut they are also an important means for political parties to build up their local presence and electoral machinery ahead of national polls in 2026.\n\nCarazza points out the local races this year will cost the public purse the same as the 2022 national polls, even though \u201cthey will be run in small territories, which require less logistics and marketing expenditure\u201d.\n\nBrazil created its public electoral fund in 2017 after the Supreme Court prohibited corporate donations following the long-running \u201cCar Wash\u201d corruption scandal.\n\nThe funds are primarily allocated to political parties based on performance in the previous national election and the number of seats they hold in Congress. The money is supposed to be used solely on electoral activity, but cases of misuse are common and sanctions are rare.\n\nOne common tactic is to field sham candidates, who do not competitively contest the polls but instead funnel the cash they receive back to the orchestrator of the scheme.\n\nThe fund has grown in size from BR$1.7bn in 2018 to BR$4.9bn this year, with the increases granted by lawmakers during annual budget negotiations.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d36d2407-15fb-40c6-a63b-307548fbcbd3"}}, {"id": "210c3f52-a94a-4ea8-a7a0-bfd1b1624e04", "event_name": "Cotton prices tumble as Brazil\u2019s exports surge", "blurb": "Increased supply and lower demand hits producers as consumers choose cheaper alternatives", "date": "2024-07-1600:00:00.0", "body": "The price of cotton has tumbled as growing competition between the world\u2019s biggest producers drives up supply while cost-conscious shoppers seek out clothes made out of cheaper fabrics.\n\nICE cotton futures fell below $0.69 a pound this month, the lowest level since October 2020 and less than half their 10-year peak hit in May 2022.\n\nPrices have been dragged down by a sharp rise in production in Brazil, which recently overtook the US as the world\u2019s largest cotton exporter. The South American country exported 12.4mn bales in the 2023-24 harvest season compared with 11.8mn that came out of the US, according to estimates by the US Department of Agriculture. Australia, the world\u2019s third-biggest exporter, shipped 5.8mn bales.\n\n\u201cWith Brazil expanding their production, going into the future we have to worry about competition from them,\u201d said Dr Jody Campiche, vice-president of economics and policy analysis of the National Cotton Council of America.\n\nBrazil has steadily increased its acreage of cotton over the past decade, reaching 1.87mn hectares planted for the 2023-2024 season, according to USDA estimates, a 13 per cent increase on the previous year. Low prices for corn \u2014 which has been falling for the past two years \u2014 have pushed farmers in Brazil\u2019s Mato Grosso state to plant cotton instead of a second corn crop, according to a report by the US Department of Agriculture.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have incentives or subsidies, a fact that pressures us to produce more and more per hectare,\u201d said Carlos Alberto Moresco, who\u00a0runs three farms in the Brazilian state of\u00a0Goi\u00e1s with a variety of crops including soy, corn, wheat, tomatoes, sorghum and cotton.\n\n\u201cBrazil has the cheapest cotton in the world. We produce almost 2 tonnes of lint [processed cotton] per hectare, which is not heard of elsewhere,\u201d he added.\n\nBrazil\u2019s soaring output has more than offset the impact of consecutive years of drought in the US, which have knocked production there to 12.5mn bales in 2023 from 17.5mn two years earlier. In 2022, the country produced its smallest harvest in a decade after months of hot, dry weather forced growers in Texas, the biggest producing state, to abandon 6mn acres of crop.\n\nWhile global prices spiked that year, they have since come down, even as US production has fallen.\n\nMeanwhile, global demand for cotton has fallen since the coronavirus pandemic as an economic slowdown and a sharp rise in interest rates have squeezed consumers.\n\nOver the past few years shoppers have increasingly opted for polyester and other man-made petroleum-based fabrics, which are cheaper and quicker to produce than cotton, but have a much larger environmental toll.\n\nSome in the market also blame computer-driven hedge funds that try to profit from latching on to market trends either up or down, claiming that selling by these quant managers has contributed to falling prices.\n\n\u201cI think an unholy amount of activity here can be traced to the funds,\u201d said Herman Kohlmeyer, a cotton broker at Michael J Nugent in New Orleans.\n\nFaced with low prices, high production costs resulting from rising fertiliser prices and other factors, and increasing competition, American farmers are struggling, although many are still planting cotton. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this will be an unhappy year for them,\u201d said Kohlmeyer.\n\nChina and India are the world\u2019s largest cotton producers, but most of their output goes to domestic buyers.\n\nBrazil\u2019s cotton harvests have grown significantly over the past two decades, mirroring its emergence as a farming powerhouse. The Latin American nation is the biggest exporter of soyabeans, orange juice, sugar and coffee; and last year it surpassed the US as top shipper of corn, although is not expected to retain the title.\n\nCampaigners have raised concerns over the environmental and social impact of cotton farming in Brazil. But Alexandre Schenkel, president of the Brazilian Cotton Producers Association (Abrapa) defended the sector\u2019s record on sustainability.\n\n\u201cToday, producers in Brazil do not deforest to plant cotton. There\u2019s a great effort to use open areas that have already been used for other crops or livestock,\u201d he said.\n\nUS production was the swing factor for prices, Schenkel added, predicting that American farmers would have better results in the next harvest. Prices could also be affected by bad harvests in important producers such as Australia, China, India or Pakistan.\n\nPrices are unlikely to rebound anytime soon, according to Campiche. Harvest levels in the US were on track to return to 2021 levels this year, while Brazil and Australia are also set to produce big crops, she said.\n\n\u201cUntil we get world cotton demand back up we\u2019re not going to get prices coming back up,\u201d said Campiche.\u00a0\u201cIf we\u2019re going to see higher cotton demand in the future, it\u2019s going to come down to: will consumers decide they want to pay more for products that are sustainable?\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/bd31f189-f7c3-4954-9ee8-b7e1b8a7e0af"}}, {"id": "bf4cfbbc-d4b6-48aa-a2cd-3c98dbab6c26", "event_name": "Milei to meet Bolsonaro in Brazil amid feud with Lula", "blurb": "Argentine leader to see rightwing Brazilian ex-president at conservative event as he trades barbs with leftist incumbent", "date": "2024-07-0600:00:00.0", "body": "A feud between Javier Milei and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is threatening to become a diplomatic crisis as the Argentine leader uses his first official visit to Brazil to meet not the Brazilian president, but his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThe expected snub as Milei heads to Brazil on Saturday comes days before a summit of the heads of nations in the South American trade bloc Mercosur, which Milei has said he will not attend. Aides close to the Argentine president say he wants to avoid meeting Lula.\n\nMilei is set to meet Bolsonaro this weekend at a conservative political conference in Brazil\u2019s southern state of Santa Catarina, at which both are due to speak.\n\nThe libertarian Milei and socialist Lula have not had an official meeting since the Argentine president took office six months ago, despite the economic ties between South America\u2019s two largest nations. Brazil is Argentina\u2019s largest trading partner, accounting for almost 18 per cent of its total exports.\n\nThe diplomatic stand-off marks the escalation of a personal feud between the two men, which was reignited when Lula last week demanded an apology from Milei for calling the Brazilian leader \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201ccommunist\u201d.\n\nThe outspoken Milei refused to apologise and then referred to Lula in a social media post entitled \u201cidiot dinosaur\u201d.\n\nPolitical analysts say the impact of the spat will be felt by the Mercosur bloc, which has appeared rudderless in recent months after failing to close a long-awaited and much-vaunted trade deal with the EU.\n\n\u201cMercosur is a bloc with very low institutionalisation, heavily dependent on presidential diplomacy. Milei\u2019s decision not to attend [the summit] is, of course, a political snub rooted in the enmity between the two presidents,\u201d said Marcelo Elizondo, president of the International Chamber of Commerce in Argentina.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that Mercosur has been in a slow crisis for a long time, and Milei\u2019s absence simply highlights its critical situation.\u201d\n\nFederico Merke, a political scientist at the University of San Andr\u00e9s in Buenos Aires, said that Milei had long been critical of Mercosur and viewed the bloc as an obstacle to unilaterally opening up Argentina\u2019s\u00a0trade.\n\n\u201cAdded to this is Milei\u2019s general disinterest in strengthening ties with neighbouring countries,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you factor in the ideological distance between Lula and Milei, it\u2019s likely that [Milei] thinks his support base would be happier seeing him alongside Jair Bolsonaro than with Lula.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro \u2014 who served as Brazilian leader from 2019 to 2022 and who is accused by police of plotting a coup to stay in power following his election defeat to Lula \u2014 attended Milei\u2019s inauguration in Buenos Aires earlier this year.\n\nRelations between Bras\u00edlia and Buenos Aires have also been complicated by the arrival in Argentina of scores of Brazilians who took part in violent anti-government riots in the Brazilian capital in January last year. The Brazilian government and Supreme Court have called the mob action an \u201cattempted coup\u201d.\n\nMany of the rioters are seeking asylum in Argentina to avoid prosecution in Brazil, but their status has not yet been determined by Buenos Aires.\n\nGilberto Ackermann, an insurance broker who was arrested after storming Brazil\u2019s presidential palace, told the Financial Times this week: \u201cI can\u2019t go back to jail.

But the government has bet on an unsustainable model of fiscal adjustment without cost-cutting.\u201d\n\nLula returned to power last year on pledges to boost welfare spending and expand the state, hoping to emulate the political success of his previous spell in government between 2003 and 2011.\u00a0His administration sought to reassure investors by promising to eliminate the so-called primary budget deficit, which does not include debt interest payments.\n\nBut it has already watered down its own targets for achieving a surplus from next year onwards, and has committed to increasing expenditure in real terms annually. Some investors and analysts fear it will fail to eliminate the deficit this year as planned.\n\nPublic debt levels \u2014 already relatively high for an emerging market at 76 per cent of gross domestic product \u2014 are now not forecast to fall until 2028, according to official estimates.\n\nMarket volatility has intensified after the government earlier this month failed to win parliamentary backing for its proposal to curtail corporate tax credits following an outcry from business, piling pressure on finance minister Fernando Haddad, whom Lula was later forced to defend.\n\n\u201cThis showed that we\u2019re hitting the limit of the model of fiscal adjustment proposed by Haddad,\u201d said Helder Soares, chief investment officer at asset manager Principal Claritas in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThe structural fiscal position is not hopeless, but it is delicate.\u201d\n\nBrazil has a history of running budget deficits, often with negative knock-on effects for inflation, interest rates and economic activity.\n\nCritics argue the loose fiscal stance limits the ability of the central bank to lower its base rate, which at 10.5 per cent has been attacked by Lula as harmful to growth.\n\nEconomists predict GDP growth will come down to 2 per cent this year from 2.9 per cent last year. While consumer price rises have slowed, forecasts for full-year inflation have crept up to 4 per cent, above the official target of 3 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe primary deficit is unlikely to be zeroed in 2024 and could be even greater in 2025,\u201d said Rafaela Vitoria, chief economist at Banco Inter, who said fiscal policy was starting to feed through to inflation.\n\nShe calculates that public spending has grown by about 6 per cent above inflation per year since Lula took office at the start of 2023, and added: \u201cThere are no containment mechanisms for 2025.\u201d\n\nAnalysts and market participants say concerns about the budget deficit and fears of political interference in central bank decisions have led investors to demand higher yields for holding the country\u2019s debt, pushing up its borrowing costs.\n\nIn defiance of Lula, the bank on Wednesday paused its easing cycle. The monetary policy committee\u2019s unanimous decision helped soothe a potential credibility crisis for the institution, after members appointed by the leftwinger pushed for a bigger rate cut in May.\n\nDespite the Bovespa edging up slightly the following day, the real touched R$5.46 to the dollar \u2014 its weakest level since Lula\u2019s inauguration.\u00a0The currency pared some of its losses to close at R$5.39 on Monday.\n\n\u201cAny bounce in asset prices will be shortlived unless the government finds a more sustainable solution to address the imbalances in the budget,\u201d said John Stavliotis, portfolio manager at Antipodes Partners.\n\nBulls argue that Brazilian stocks \u2014 trading at seven times forward earnings \u2014 are historically cheap. This year to the end of May, the FTSE Brazil All Cap index is ranked 49th out of 50 country indices tracked by the data provider.\n\nIn the wake of investor disquiet and the failure to gain backing for the corporate tax credit plan, Haddad has raised the possibility of spending cuts in certain areas. However, he faces resistance from within his ruling Workers\u2019 party, while Lula has said ministers must convince him of the necessity.\n\nSupporters of the government and some investors argue that Brazil\u2019s primary deficit \u2014 forecast by the IMF to be 0.6 per cent of GDP this year \u2014 is relatively small compared with countries such as Mexico, where the budget shortfall is expected to reach nearly 6 per cent.\n\nEven so, commentators see little appetite in government for significant cutbacks ahead of municipal elections in October.\n\n\u201c[Lula] had a honeymoon in his first year and that\u2019s coming to an end,\u201d said Jean Van de Walle, chief investment officer at family office Sycamore Capital. \u201cThere will be a growing clash [between] monetary orthodoxy and the government\u2019s ambitions.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Mary McDougall in London", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2538f75c-535e-44a8-8c81-3c8feef08473"}}, {"id": "57019fb6-181b-4199-b299-2d7e61a3a36b", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 party seeks to gag central bank chief", "blurb": "Senior PT figures file lawsuit against Roberto Campos Neto over alleged political bias  ", "date": "2024-06-1900:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s ruling party has filed a lawsuit against the head of the country\u2019s central bank as it steps up attacks over the pace of rate cuts and alleged political bias.\n\nSenior figures in President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s Workers\u2019 party on Wednesday filed a lawsuit at a federal court in Bras\u00edlia requesting that Roberto Campos Neto be banned from making political statements.\n\nThe lawsuit came a day after Lula publicly criticised Campos Neto, claiming that he \u201cworks much more to harm the country than to help\u201d by not cutting rates more quickly.\n\n\u201cWe only have one thing that\u2019s wrong in Brazil right now \u2014 it\u2019s the behaviour of the central bank,\u201d Lula said on Tuesday. \u201cWe have a bank president who does not demonstrate any capacity for autonomy\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there is no explanation for the [current] interest rate.\u201d\n\nThe legal action marks a sharp escalation of the war of words between the Workers\u2019 party \u2014 known commonly as the PT \u2014 and the central bank chief, which has raged since Lula returned to office for a third term last year.\n\nElected on pledges to kick-start Latin America\u2019s largest economy and improve the livelihoods of its poorest citizens, Lula has sought to blame slow progress on Campos Neto \u2014 a respected former finance professional.\n\nThe central bank has been gradually reducing the benchmark Selic interest rate for almost a year, cutting it from 13.75 per cent to 10.5 per cent. Lula has criticised the pace of the cuts for being too slow.\n\nLula and his party have also accused Campos Neto of political bias following a series of events that appeared to show that the bank chief had links to leading rightwing politicians.\n\nThe lawsuit was prompted by reports that the bank chief had attended a dinner in his honour hosted by Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas, the rightwing governor of S\u00e3o Paulo and a possible future presidential candidate. Media reports cited in the legal documents say Campos Neto was offered a job in a potential future De Freitas administration.\n\nBrazil\u2019s central bank was granted formal autonomy from political control by congress in 2021, and Lula is due to appoint a new head when Campos Neto\u2019s term expires at the end of this year.\n\nBut the dispute between Lula and Campos Neto threatens to create a credibility crisis for the bank as investors fear there is a political split between monetary committee members appointed by former Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 including Campos Neto \u2014 and those appointed by Lula.\n\nThe latter have pushed for bigger rate cuts, according to minutes from the May decision.\n\nMarcelo Fonseca, chief economist at Reag Investimentos, said the spat was \u201cnoise that makes it much more costly to manage expectations, harming the efficiency of monetary policy and raising risk premiums on asset prices in general\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is convenient to use the bank chief as the villain and monetary policy as the root cause of the problems rather than recognise that economic policy, and fiscal policy in particular, needs to be fixed,\u201d he added.\n\nThe central bank on Wednesday kept the Selic rate steady at 10.5 per cent in a unanimous decision of its monetary committee.

Economists believe the floods will shave about 0.3 per cent off Brazil\u2019s GDP this year.\n\nThe rainfall, which exceeded 1,000 millimetres in some places, affected one in five residents of the state\u2019s residents and killed 175. It left cities underwater, caused landslides that closed segments of big roads and saw the army drafted in to rescue stranded residents. About 420,000 are still displaced.\n\nThe inundation followed other floods in June, September and November last year that killed 75 people.\n\nThe scale of the damage has drawn comparisons with Hurricane Katrina, which ravaged the southern US in 2005. Some estimates put the cost of reconstruction at more than R$100bn ($19bn).\n\nFederasul\u2019s president Rodrigo Costa describes the impact of the floods as \u201cdevastating\u201d. \u201cTo restructure in a more resilient and robust way for this new reality of climate alterations, we\u2019re talking about a number of years,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the authorities would be to convince people to remain in the region and creating sustainable communities, said Aod Cunha, an economist and former state finance secretary.\n\n\u201cThere are so many short-term emergency demands, I\u2019m afraid the long-term solutions to avoid damage related to climate change might not get the right attention,\u201d Cunha added.\n\nThis is already felt in the small valley community of Roca Sales, where the floodwaters of the Taquari river left behind a huge crater. At footwear manufacturer Beira Rio, the town\u2019s biggest employer, the workforce is down by about a quarter to 650 and the company is struggling to find new workers.\n\n\u201cIt was always a bit difficult to recruit new workers,\u201d said Rodrigo Argenta, the company\u2019s vice-president. He added that since the floods, \u201cemployees asked to leave or have moved away\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it was very traumatic\u201d.\n\nAgriculture has been particularly badly hit by the floods. Rio Grande do Sul produces more than two-thirds of Brazil\u2019s rice, along with soyabeans and other crops, and losses are expected. Livestock have perished by drowning or through lack of feed due to transport difficulties.\n\nTadeu Wodzik, a smallholder who has made a living growing carrots, cabbage and beetroot for three decades, has nothing left of his plot but a vast pond and the empty shell of a greenhouse; his organic vegetable garden is still submerged.\n\n\u201cIt was ready to harvest, there just wasn\u2019t time,\u201d said the 55-year-old in Eldorado do Sul, outside state capital Porto Alegre. \u201cNow we have to start all over again.\u201d\n\nTo help Rio Grande do Sul to recover, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has announced support packages worth R$62.5bn, including a freeze on the state\u2019s debt repayments to the federal government for three years and subsidised credit for businesses.\n\nHowever, some private sector leaders say the measures are insufficient, with many companies unable to post collateral for loans or needing forbearance on existing debts.\n\nIn the municipality of Encantado in the Taquari Valley, family-owned soap and chemical manufacturer Fontana had already faced shutdowns due to previous floods; the latest one caused damage almost equal to the R$60mn it had invested in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt makes me want to cry. Without help, a lot of companies will succumb,\u201d said board member \u00c2ngelo Fontana. The company plans to relocate some of its operations, but part of the plant cannot be moved. \u201cIn reality, a business like ours can\u2019t be here. The river will stay, so we have to leave,\u201d he added.\n\nCritics have accused the authorities of failing to adequately prepare for the floods. Scientists and engineers say infrastructure and monitoring systems need to be improved and adapted to make the country more resilient to threats from global warming.\n\nThe extreme rainfall that led to the floods was made more likely by climate change, and intensified by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which warms the Pacific Ocean\u2019s surface and changes global weather patterns, according to a study by the World Weather Attribution group.\n\n\u201cThere has been an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme [weather] events in Rio Grande do Sul over the last two decades, and especially in the last five years,\u201d Aquino from the federal university of Rio Grande do Sul said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely to increase due to climate change.\u201d\n\nIn the short term the most pressing tasks facing the local authorities are repairing bridges and finding homes for the displaced as temperatures drop in the southern hemisphere\u2019s winter.\n\nOn a sunny morning in the historic downtown of the state capital, workers swept out storefronts and threw debris left when the filthy flood waters receded on to heaps outside.\n\nThe entire area had been swamped after the Gua\u00edba river broke its banks to reach 5.3 metres \u2014 far above a previous record of 4.76 metres in 1941.\n\n\u201cWe have no certainty it won\u2019t happen again,\u201d said Marcia Regina Lubenova, who runs a small indoor car park and caf\u00e9. \u201cBut we have to grab on to hope.

After 10 days on the trail I had no clothes that weren\u2019t damp and stinking. Ticks and mosquitoes had besieged my arms and legs. I lay in the dripping dark, wondering how it had come to this. Once upon a time, luxury travel was about gold taps and chocolates on the pillow. Of course, the genre has widened to include ever more exclusive and unusual experiences \u2014 but physical discomfort and insect bites were never part of the equation.\n\nI first encountered Gift of Go through its sprawling, lavishly illustrated website, which pitched the company as something of an antidote to a travel industry dedicated to commodifying adventure. Rather than selling \u201ccarefully crafted authenticity and readily collectible \u2018once-in-a-lifetime\u2019 experiences\u201d this new company promised \u201ctrue stories\u201d and \u201cthe most compelling journeys on earth\u201d \u2014 albeit at sky-high prices.\n\nGift of Go is the creation of Eddie Lott, 43, a Texan, and his wife Elisa Oliveira, 32, travel-industry newcomers based in the small town of Diamantina in northern Minas Gerais. Launched this year after three years of research and planning, the company\u2019s trips include a 28-day expedition on foot and horseback in Brazil\u2019s Serra do Espinha\u00e7o \u2014 a vast and little-visited mountain wilderness in the former diamond-mining region of Minas Gerais. Guests camp or stay in village houses, and pay a very luxurious-sounding $2,000 per person, per day, for the privilege.\n\nTowards the end of 2023 I interviewed the couple several times by Zoom. Little did I know that in fact it was me who was being assessed \u2014 for my state of health, level of trekking experience, and general suitability to join them as a guinea pig on a condensed version of their 28-day trip, entitled \u201cDiamonds/Wild Tales + Lost Trails\u201d. Condensed it might be, but it was still a two-week journey through some very tough terrain indeed.\n\nThen the packing list arrived. It spoke volumes, but also opened up whole new vistas of doubt and trepidation. Sleeping mats, headlamps and heavy-duty bug sprays were all required. Clothes were to be soaked in liquid permethrin, a powerful insect repellent, to ward off ticks. Much of the modern language of hiking gear was foreign to me, but there were words even I could recognise \u2014 like \u201csnakes\u201d. A pair of wraparound gaiters for protection against the region\u2019s venomous serpents, which tend to attack at shin-level, was apparently essential.\n\nI flew in to S\u00e3o Paulo and took a connecting flight to Belo Horizonte, state capital of Minas Gerais, where Lott and Oliveira picked me up for the four-hour drive north to Diamantina. For 200 years during the Portuguese colonial era this small town was a global centre of the diamond trade. The rivers of northern Minas were dredged for gold and precious stones using slave labour, these riches being funnelled directly into the coffers of the Portuguese crown. With the final decline of the local diamond trade in the late 20th century, the region fell into grinding rural poverty and chronic depopulation.\n\nWhat remains is its huge and almost entirely unexploited natural landscape. Today the conservation areas of the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o include a national park, various state parks and other reserves, adding up to more than 150,000ha of protected land. Our great trek\u2019s (very roughly) circular route would take us south and east out of Diamantina into the back country along the Jequitinhonha river valley, moving up into the highlands of Rio Preto State Park and plunging into the immensity of Sempre Vivas National Park before looping back towards Diamantina and civilisation. This was, explained Lott, not only among the most sparsely populated regions anywhere in Brazil, but had almost no tourist infrastructure either.\n\nEarly on an April morning we left S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Rio das Pedras, a low-rise colonial village where a rustic pousada would be the last conventional accommodation I\u2019d be seeing for a while, heading into wide-open country where white sand trails once used by mule-riding tropeiros (commercial travellers) meandered between rocky uplands. Accompanying us was Julio Brabo, a local geologist, geographer and trail guide with a wide-ranging knowledge of the Serra do Espinha\u00e7o in all its grandeur and complexity. Understanding these surroundings meant learning from Brabo about the various biomes we\u2019d be traversing, such as mata atl\u00e2ntica, the broadleaved forest typical of southern and eastern Brazil, and cerrado, a rocky savannah of tremendous biodiversity.\n\nAfter a long wet summer a blazing sun had kick-started the Serra into exuberant life. The cerrado was exploding in blasts of purple, yellow, white, and Barbie pink. By the side of the trail lay a bunch of small white sempre-viva flowers with a button-like shape and long thin stems, seemingly left there to dry. Sempre-viva is highly valued by the international floristry trade, said Brabo, and gathering the flowers provides a source of revenue for the hardscrabble rural communities on the outer edges of the Serra.\n\nOur walking fell into a quick, steady rhythm. The four of us moved ahead in single file, scrambling up rough hillsides of quartzite rock, fording streams and picking through boggy meadows. As we went, Lott told me tales of his days as a backpacking wanderer in Central and South America, his recycling business in Dallas, Texas, and his career as a singer-songwriter (his 2015 album \u201cBlame It On My Wild Soul\u201d is still streaming on Spotify). Oliveira, an architect by training, was born and raised in Minas Gerais.\n\nLott had driven through the region in 2013 and, when he stopped at a gas station, took a photo of the lush green surroundings. When the image popped up as an automated \u201cmemory\u201d on his phone a few years later, he decided to return to explore. \u201cThat was the start of my relationship with the Espinha\u00e7o,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was hard going, but amazing and beautiful. It was so remote. And best of all, there was nobody here.\u201d\n\nFrom the top of Pico do Raio at 1,405 metres, massive views stretched to a bluish horizon. The silence up here was deep and viscous. Flocks of yellow and black swallowtail butterflies fluttered ecstatically around the summit. After a hard climb my breath came in gasps, my heart thumping over billows of nausea. If this was described in the itinerary as an \u201ceasy\u201d 25km day, I reflected nervously, how on earth would I cope with a difficult one?\n\nThe answer would come soon enough. Out in this untrammelled wilderness there would be moments of exhaustion, but also of exhilaration, such as I\u2019d never known in a lifetime of travel. Some nights we slept in tents in forest clearings or on white-sand river beaches. Other times our lodgings were dirt-floored adobe houses in remote hamlets. Especially when the going got tough, I privately wondered about Gift of Go\u2019s business model and its potential clientele \u2014 both willing and able to take on this spartan travel regime, and happy to pay for it to the tune of $2,000 a day, or even more for the bespoke trips on offer. For many years Lott had had in mind the idea of offering \u201ctransformative journeys\u201d in off-the-map places. The course he took at the Boulder Outdoor Survival School (BOSS), a survival-skills centre in the Utah desert where he shared water rations with multi-millionaire executives, suggested there might be a niche market for this kind of hardcore adventure tourism.\n\nDay five was a 31k monster. After reveille at 4am and a breakfast of sweet black coffee and biscuits, we set off along a valley where giant mango trees stood like oaks and humpbacked cattle grazed the verdant meadows. Grey crags in phantasmagorical, eroded forms thrust themselves out of the landscape; up ahead loomed the forbidding, flat-topped peak of Itamb\u00e9 (2052 metres).\n\n\u201cWhere in Europe does this scene remind you of?\u201d asked Lott. I racked my brain, but his question went unanswered. Everything here was new and strange; nothing lay within my frame of reference.\n\nA rushing sound in the distance might be one of two things: a breeze blowing through the waving indai\u00e1 palms, or a fast-flowing river with waters whose natural tannins stained them the colour of Coca-Cola. Sometimes we\u2019d stop beside one of these rivers to sling off our backpacks, fill up our water bottles, and nibble on Brazilian trail food like banana bars and biscoitinho, a weirdly addictive tapioca puff.\n\nDusk was falling when we pitched up at the house of Santos Evaristo and Maria da Concei\u00e7ao Aguiar, an elderly couple belonging to the Espinha\u00e7o\u2019s ever-decreasing population of subsistence farmers. From the valley bottom came the rumble of a waterfall. At the farmhouse Maria bustled barefoot around her earth-floored kitchen. On a wood-fired range sat bubbling pans of frango caipira (chicken stew), costelinha (braised pork ribs), fried okra, beans, and the polenta-like maize porridge ang\u00fa \u2014 the ribsticking repertoire of traditional mineiro cooking. Ravenous with hunger, we piled our tin plates high while Santos, wearing a battered cowboy hat and a grizzled moustache, handed round jam jars full of home-made cacha\u00e7a.\n\nWe would need all the sustenance we could get. Jewel in the crown of northern Minas\u2019 conservation areas is the mighty Sempre Vivas National Park, which covers an area the size of Los Angeles but whose inhabitants could be counted (said Lott) on the fingers of two hands. It was here, I found, that the demands of the trek were at their harshest. In the taquaral, a dense bamboo forest at the heart of the park, the trails had grown over and Lott began bushwhacking to left and right with a machete like a real-life Indiana Jones. Careful with the unha de gato, said Oliveira: the fearful spines of the \u201ccat\u2019s claw\u201d creeper can rip your flesh open. Despite the permethrin, clumps of tiny ticks had begun to appear around my waist and thighs.\n\nUnlike the usual run of high-end adventure operators, Gift of Go doesn\u2019t do glamping, Aman-style luxe-in-the-middle-of-nowhere, or surprise-and-delight dinners with white linen tablecloths in stunning locations. (Though Lott\u2019s veggie risotto, cooked on a calor-gas burner poised on a boulder, wasn\u2019t bad at all.) Bathing possibilities were reduced (or increased) to a dip in the river. Toilet facilities involved wandering a discreet distance from the camp with a trowel in hand, keeping a weather eye out for snakes.\n\nYet there were many compensations. Various sections of the trek were undertaken on mules and horses provided by local cowboys, and one evening we made a memorable four-hour descent from the high plains of Sempre Vivas to the village of Curimata\u00ed, my sure-footed mule picking its way down a perilous stony gorge under a refulgent moon.\n\nAnother great pay-off was chasing waterfalls. The Serra do Espinha\u00e7o is prodigal in the number and magnificence of its cachoeiras or waterfalls, some of which are so inaccessible they may not have been visited for years. At one nameless wonder, reached by a tortuous trail through thick scrub, we clambered down to lounge at the base of the falls, awestruck by the water\u2019s howling roar and the savage beauty of this lost world.\n\nIn the mud-spattered settlement of Quart\u00e9is we spent our last night on the fringes of the Espinha\u00e7o. In our two weeks of tramping the trails of the Serra, extraordinary as it seemed, we\u2019d seen not a single fellow traveller. This was the land that not only time, but also tourism, had forgotten.\n\nWe stumbled back into Diamantina on a Saturday night when the town was brimful of visitors for the Vesperata, a festival with local bandsmen playing from the balconies. Feeling out of place in our sweaty, grimy clothes, we wandered the cobbled streets, thinking how overdressed and overfed these party people looked and how the Espinha\u00e7o\u2019s ragged, rugged wilderness already seemed half a world away.\n\nI would miss our little gang of four. Lott and Oliveira plan to maintain the intimate, hands-on vibe of their fledgling company, guiding the trips in person and keeping guest numbers down to a single individual or small group. But what about the price? Is this simply a company selling backpacking to the very well-off? While admitting the rates might be \u201cuncommon\u201d, Lott argues they are fair given the client/staff ratio and remote locations. Each trip has five full-time staff and between five and 15 more part-time helpers, horsemen, cooks and so on. \u201cEach one is highly personalised and crafted \u2014 and we only guide very few per year.\u201d For Gift of Go\u2019s next phase he is turning his attention to two more of the world\u2019s untouristed places: the Dari\u00e9n Gap on the Panama/Colombia border, and the lonely deserts of Big Bend Country where south west Texas bumps up against northern Mexico.\n\nCertainly this trek in the Brazilian highlands had been unlike any journey I\u2019d undertaken. The challenges it posed had left me tired and four kilos lighter than when I\u2019d started, but there was also a deep satisfaction and a new confidence in my capacity for physical endurance. I thought of those Shakespeare plays where characters go into a wood and emerge lightly bruised by their adventures, but permanently wiser.\n\nPaul Richardson was a guest of Gift of Go (thegiftofgo.com)\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FTWeekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nSame travel formula \u2014 willing buyer, willing seller / From Cynthia Miyashita, Gatika, Biscay, Spain", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8420f0ab-fbaa-4c5c-812c-292f6ea9a684"}}, {"id": "e1a670ad-ac68-4e94-8184-78fe8839819e", "event_name": "The judge behind the drive to bury Latin America\u2019s biggest corruption probe", "blurb": "Dias Toffoli infuriates campaigners by helping dismantle legacy of \u2018Car Wash\u2019 investigation in Brazil", "date": "2024-06-0600:00:00.0", "body": "The meeting was chaired by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and its uncontroversial focus was disaster relief for Brazil\u2019s flood-stricken south.\n\nBut the presence of two guests shunned for years in political circles for corruption, and their proximity to Lula, represented a startling comeback from disgrace.\n\nSeated on either side of the president at the May meeting in Bras\u00edlia were Joesley and Wesley Batista, the billionaire brothers behind meatpacking giant JBS who had admitted to paying multimillion-dollar bribes during the high-profile Lava Jato \u2014 or \u201cCar Wash\u201d \u2014 corruption scandal.\n\nFor many, their very public return to the fold underlines how comprehensively the legacy of the long-running Car Wash investigation is being erased following Lula\u2019s return last year to the presidency for his third, non-consecutive term. The decade-old bribery probe uncovered widespread graft involving scores of politicians and businessmen during a period when Lula\u2019s party was previously in power.\n\nMuch of the work to dismantle the results of the investigation \u2014 which recovered billions of dollars from companies involved \u2014 has been at the hands of the Supreme Court and, in particular, Justice Jos\u00e9 Antonio Dias Toffoli.\n\nA former lawyer for Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party, Toffoli has over the past year provoked the ire of anti-corruption activists with a series of controversial decisions.\n\nThe judge last month annulled all criminal rulings against industrialist Marcelo Odebrecht, scion of construction conglomerate Odebrecht and a central figure in the Car Wash investigation, who in 2016 admitted to offences including bribery and served time in prison.\n\nThe US Department of Justice at the time said that Odebrecht and its petrochemicals unit Braskem \u201cused a hidden but fully functioning\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009business unit \u2014 a \u2018Department of Bribery\u2019, so to speak \u2014 that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents\u201d. It called the scheme the \u201clargest foreign bribery case in history\u201d.\n\nThe overturning of the rulings against Marcelo Odebrecht came on the same day that a panel of Supreme Court judges voted to overturn a 2017 conviction of Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, a longtime Lula ally and another central figure in the Car Wash probe, on the grounds that a limitation period had expired.\n\nIn the past six months, Toffoli has also suspended multimillion-dollar corruption fines levied in a deal with Brazilian federal prosecutors on Odebrecht, the company \u2014 now rebranded as Novonor \u2014 and J&F, the holding entity of the Batista brothers, who sat with Lula in the meeting in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nThe latter ruling raised claims from activists and opposition politicians of a conflict of interest because Toffoli\u2019s wife had worked as legal counsel for J&F on a separate case.\n\nIn response to queries from the Financial Times, the justice\u2019s office said his decisions followed a precedent set by the court in 2022 and were \u201cbased on the constitution and the country\u2019s laws\u201d. The suspended fines were currently being renegotiated between the government and companies, it added.\n\nThomas Traumann, a former government minister who now runs a political consultancy, said: \u201cIt is extremely worrisome. What Toffoli is doing is basically trying to erase all the good parts of the Car Wash operation.\n\n\u201cDuring the last 10 years, there is no doubt that both Brazilian state and private companies improved their compliance. But what Toffoli is doing is saying: \u2018You don\u2019t need to care [about being prosecuted for graft] because in 10 years the justice system will just let it go.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe scandal dates back to 2014, when the federal police probe uncovered a multibillion-dollar contracts-for-kickbacks scheme involving state-controlled energy group Petrobras, a cartel of construction companies and dozens of politicians from across the political spectrum.\n\nAfter scores of high-profile arrests, the operation won plaudits for tackling a deeply entrenched culture of impunity among Brazil\u2019s rich and powerful. Later revelations, however, of collusion between judges and prosecutors fuelled claims from those targeted that it was a politically motivated witch-hunt.\n\nAfter a legally contentious trial, Lula was himself convicted in 2017 of money laundering and corruption and spent almost 600 days in prison, before the Supreme Court annulled his cases and restored his right to run for office.\n\nThe president has repeatedly lambasted the probe, calling it the \u201cbiggest lie\u201d in Brazilian history and claiming the US had plotted to undermine Petrobras.\n\nToffoli, who became a justice in 2009 and is likely to serve until his mandatory retirement in 2042, has said that the collusion between judges and prosecutors in the Car Wash operation prevented proper legal process from taking place.\n\nA source close to the justice said Toffoli had always been critical of the excesses of the Car Wash probe and \u201cthe way [the operation] was being done. He never made a secret of it.\u201d\n\nThe judge\u2019s wife had represented J&F in an unrelated case and no longer works on behalf of the company, they added. The person said Brazilian law did not require Toffoli to recuse himself from the case in which J&F\u2019s fine was suspended.\n\nBut critics have rounded on the fact that Toffoli made his recent moves alone, without the backing of the full 11-member court. So-called monocratic decisions are a common albeit controversial practice in the court.\n\n\u201cA single Supreme Court justice, alone, without consulting anyone, has decided to nullify all proceedings against Marcelo Odebrecht. What is the point of having 10 other justices if no one does anything about it?\u201d said Adriana Ventura, a federal lawmaker with the rightwing Novo party.\n\nShe highlighted the abundance of \u201cconfessions, recordings and other evidence\u201d unearthed during the Car Wash probe.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s reputation is already \u201cremarkably low in popular opinion\u201d, according to Rubens Glezer, a law professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. While Toffoli was legally allowed to judge the J&F case despite his wife\u2019s involvement with the company because of court precedent, Glezer said the issue reflected \u201ca culture where the Supreme Court [judges] don\u2019t feel like they need to be publicly accountable\u201d.\n\nLocal media have reported a rift on the Supreme Court bench as a result of Toffoli\u2019s decisions, but have said justices are reluctant to speak publicly for fear of jeopardising the solidarity of the court, which is already under sustained attack from Brazil\u2019s far right.\n\nIn a recent interview with the FT, Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso, the president of the court, said: \u201cI think the Car Wash operation revealed some very important corruption schemes. That was the positive side of it. And there were mistakes and excesses also. So I see it in these two perspectives.\u201d\n\nA poll by AtlasIntel this week showed that six out of 10 Brazilians surveyed disagreed with Toffoli\u2019s decision to annul the Marcelo Odebrecht cases, more than double the number who agreed.\n\nThe same research showed Toffoli had the worst public image of all members of the Supreme Court, with 52 per cent of those surveyed saying they had a negative image of him.\n\nIn Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index released this year, Brazil dropped 10 positions to rank 104th of 180 countries. Days after the critical report, Toffoli ordered the Berlin-based corruption watchdog to be investigated over claims it misappropriated public resources during the Car Wash probe.\n\nTransparency International denies the allegations and Toffoli\u2019s order sparked concerns that the court was trying to cow its detractors.\n\n\u201c[Toffoli\u2019s] decisions give the public a feeling that Brazil is going backwards,\u201d said Carlos Pereira, a professor of political science at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.\n\n\u201cThey generate disappointment, cynicism, disdain for politics itself \u2014 that powerful people always get away with it \u2014 and this paves the way for populism.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f94f1279-b011-441d-9c9b-2841bab1714f"}}, {"id": "cd1feadc-a44e-408a-977b-83193d383e4a", "event_name": "China\u2019s plan to sell cheap EVs to the rest of the world", "blurb": "Shut out of the US by tariffs and facing a backlash in Europe, Chinese carmakers could end up dominating many emerging markets ", "date": "2024-06-0500:00:00.0", "body": "The resurrection of a car plant in Brazil\u2019s poor north-east stands as a symbol of China\u2019s global advance \u2014 and the west\u2019s retreat.\n\nBYD, the Shenzhen-based conglomerate, has taken over an old Ford factory in Cama\u00e7ari, which was abandoned by the American automaker nearly a century after Henry Ford first set up operations in Brazil.\n\nWhen Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s president, visited China last year, he met BYD\u2019s billionaire founder and chair Wang Chuanfu. After that meeting, BYD picked the country for its first carmaking hub outside of Asia.\n\nUnder a $1bn-plus investment plan, BYD intends to start producing electric and hybrid automobiles this year at the site in Bahia state, which will also manufacture bus and truck chassis and process battery materials.\n\nThe new Brazil plant is no outlier \u2014 it falls into a wave of corporate Chinese investment in electric vehicle manufacturing supply chains in the world\u2019s most important developing economies.\n\nThe inadvertent result of rising protectionism in the US and Europe could be to drive many emerging markets into China\u2019s hands.\n\nLast month, Joe Biden issued a new broadside against Beijing\u2019s deep financial support of Chinese industry as he unveiled sweeping new tariffs on\u00a0a range of cleantech products \u2014 most notably, a 100 per cent tariff on electric vehicles. \u201cIt\u2019s not competition.\u00a0It\u2019s cheating. And we\u2019ve seen the damage here in America,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe measures were partly aimed at boosting Biden\u2019s chances in his presidential battle with Donald Trump. But the tariffs, paired with rising restrictions on Chinese investment on American soil, will have immense impact on the global auto market, in effect shutting China\u2019s world-leading EV makers out of the world\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nThe EU\u2019s own anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric cars is expected to conclude next week as Brussels tries to protect European carmakers by stemming the flow of low-cost Chinese electric vehicles into the bloc.\n\nGovernment officials, executives and experts say that the series of new cleantech tariffs issued by Washington and Brussels is forcing China\u2019s leading players to sharpen their focus on markets in the rest of the world.\n\nThis, they argue, will lead to Chinese dominance across the world\u2019s most important emerging markets, including south-east Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and the remaining western economies that are less protectionist than the US and Europe.\n\n\u201cThat is the part that seems to be lost in this whole discussion of \u2018can we raise some tariffs and slow down the Chinese advance\u2019? That\u2019s only defending your homeland. That\u2019s leaving everything else open,\u201d says Bill Russo, the former head of Chrysler in Asia and founder of Automobility, a Shanghai consultancy.\n\n\u201cThose markets are in play and China is aggressively going after those markets.\u201d\n\nThe new Chinese investments are often two-pronged \u2014 both in car manufacturing and the raw materials that are central to the new economy.\n\nIlaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the west needs to understand that China\u2019s global ambitions create an opportunity for many countries to expand their manufacturing base and to obtain foreign direct investment in \u201ctechnologies of the future\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s cleantech investments in the developing world, she says, \u201creally complicates\u201d foreign policy for western governments, which have already tried to warn about the risk of becoming dependent on Beijing through President Xi Jinping\u2019s so-called Belt and Road infrastructure programme.\n\n\u201cIt is tough to tell a country in the developing world, \u2018Hey, you shouldn\u2019t want to have more factories or refining because it\u2019s Chinese investment\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cWith the [Belt and Road Initiative] there was a credible argument that a lot of debt is not going to be sustainable\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but here if they open factories, they hire local people, then in the minds of the leaders of these countries, \u2018why not?\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts that this year 10.1mn EVs will be sold in China, 3.4mn in Europe, 1.7mn in the US. Fewer than 1.5mn EVs will be sold everywhere else in the world.\n\nYet the agency has forecast that the global EV fleet will grow eight-fold to about 240mn in 2030. This implies annual global EV sales of 20mn cars in 2025 and 40mn in 2030, or 30 per cent of all car sales. Moreover, an increasingly large share of that expansion is likely to come from new markets.\n\nIn some important developing economies, Chinese companies are investing in both production and processing raw materials. Nowhere is this more striking than China\u2019s involvement in the EV ecosystem in Indonesia, home to the world\u2019s largest reserves of nickel, a key component of EV batteries.\n\nLast year alone companies domiciled in China and Hong Kong invested $13.9bn in Indonesia, most of which is believed to have been in the metals and mining industry. Chinese companies account for more than 90 per cent of the nickel smelters in the country.\n\nChinese banks have also been keen to provide financing for nickel plants when others have been hesitant, says Alexander Barus, chief executive of the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park \u2014 the country\u2019s largest nickel processing site, which was built by Tsingshan, a Chinese nickel producer, and a local partner.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started searching for mining investment, we went around the banks in Indonesia, no one supported us. The banks were in doubt, whether it would be profitable or not. But when we went to Chinese banks, they were ready to finance,\u201d says Barus.\n\nHaving secured access to Indonesia\u2019s key resources, Chinese companies have also been the first movers in setting up EV manufacturing plants, even as Indonesia \u2014 and President Joko Widodo personally \u2014 have courted other big names such as Tesla to set up EV manufacturing. BYD said early this year that it would invest $1.3bn in an EV factory in Indonesia.\n\nThe story is similar in Brazil where BYD and compatriot group Great Wall Motor are about to commence local manufacturing that could also serve for exports to the wider region.\n\nGreat Wall is investing about $1.9bn in Latin America\u2019s largest economy with production expected to start this year at a former Mercedes-Benz factory in Iracem\u00e1polis, S\u00e3o Paulo state.\n\nAs well as its investment in auto production at Cama\u00e7ari, BYD is also on the lookout for lithium mining assets in Brazil, which is ramping up extraction of the key metal for EV batteries.\n\nBrazil, which is the world\u2019s sixth-biggest car market, has been relatively slow to embrace electrification. This is attributed in part to its widespread use of lower-carbon ethanol derived from sugarcane. But there are already signs of a shift. Last year sales of EVs almost doubled in Brazil and in recent months the country overtook Belgium to become the largest single export destination for Chinese EVs.\n\nIn an effort to stimulate a homegrown industry, Bras\u00edlia is imposing rising tariffs on EV and hybrid imports \u2014 these will hit 35 per cent by mid-2026. Lula, himself a former metal worker, has promulgated a vision of a \u201cgreen\u201d industrial rejuvenation.\n\nChina\u2019s publicity drive in the region includes BYD\u2019s sponsorship of the Copa Am\u00e9rica football tournament for South American nations. Such marketing campaigns, coupled with aggressive pricing by Chinese car brands, has led to acceptance by Brazilian consumers, says Cassio Pagliarini, chief marketing officer at Bright Consulting, an automotive sector specialist.\n\nIn China, the expanding global push by EV makers is seen as part of the broader strategy under Xi of boosting political and economic ties with developing countries via his flagship Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nOver recent years the value of China\u2019s exports to emerging markets has overtaken that with developed economies, a historic change after decades of Chinese growth being more dependent on G7 economies.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of national strategy, there is no doubt that the focus of China\u2019s future foreign economic strategy will shift towards developing countries,\u201d Tu Xinquan, a professor and dean of China Institute for WTO Studies, at the University of International Business and Economics, told local media the day after Biden imposed new tariffs on Chinese EVs.\n\nYet the expansion of China\u2019s auto industry into these new markets is threatening to eat into the strong market share held by several multinational automakers.\n\nThis is particularly worrying for Japanese companies which have built up a strong position in the south-east Asian market. \u201cChina can make a very compelling sales pitch to south-east Asian countries,\u201d says a senior Japanese government official, highlighting Beijing\u2019s ability to sell not just electric vehicles but also critical raw materials for batteries. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest risk for Japan.\u201d\n\nAnother senior executive working with a Japanese carmaker was more direct: \u201cWe\u2019re terrified that Chinese cars will flood into south-east Asian markets.\u201d\n\nJens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, says China\u2019s push to promote high-tech manufacturing has put its companies into direct competition with their European counterparts in many sectors in markets across the world, including autos.\n\nEuropean businesses should not be \u201ccomplacent about the situation\u201d, he adds.\n\nFor some countries, the arrival of China\u2019s EV industry is creating new tensions with a US administration, which does not want to cede influence to Beijing.\n\nOver the past year, US officials have repeatedly warned that the Biden administration will take action if China tries to ease its industrial overcapacity problem by dumping goods on international markets.\n\nOne particular point of concern in Washington is Mexico, which has access to the US market through the USMCA, the trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. Chinese companies, including BYD, have said they want to build factories in the country and several other rivals including MG and Chery have been talking to Mexican officials for more than a year.\n\nMexico\u2019s government has been careful to not be seen to be courting China and has made clear in public statements its priority is the US relationship, including signing a memorandum of intent to start screening investments over the risk they pose to national security.\n\nLeftist President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has nationalised the country\u2019s lithium supplies and cancelled a concession held by Chinese firm Ganfeng for an operating mine in the country\u2019s north.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, Mexico\u2019s president-elect after a landslide victory on Sunday, leaned heavily on Chinese companies for transportation projects when she was mayor of Mexico City, buying electric buses and contracting out the renovation of the city\u2019s oldest subway line to Chinese firms.\n\nYet Sheinbaum, a leftwing former climate scientist, insisted during the election campaign that USMCA would remain \u201cfundamental\u201d.\n\nMexican consumers, however, are rapidly embracing cars from China. Last year, one in five cars sold was made in China, although half of those were produced by non-Chinese brands.\n\nGuillermo Rosales, head of Mexican auto distributors association AMDA, says imports from China have led to a clogging of ports in the country\u2019s Pacific coast such as L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas.\n\n\u201cWith the arrival of Chinese cars, [consumers] have a greater supply and more options to choose from,\u201d he says, adding that US concerns did not worry Mexican consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s a very open market for competition.\u201d\n\nIn Australia, China\u2019s global expansion is also leading to new questions about national security as new high-tech cars collect information from drivers and their surroundings.\n\nA sharp increase in the number of Chinese-branded EVs on its roads \u2014 BYD\u2019s sales were up sixfold last year \u2014 has sparked complaints over data and infrastructure security.\n\nAustralia was the first country to ban the use of Chinese telecoms vendors in its 5G networks in 2018 setting off a period of tension with China. The move to ban Huawei and ZTE was supported by Australia\u2019s security services, which said that the use of \u201chigh-risk\u201d vendors in the telecoms networks could have had implications for the security of data and infrastructure in the country including transportation.\n\nOpposition senator James Paterson has argued that the potential risk posed by Chinese EVs went beyond the person buying and driving the car but to the community they live in given the amount of data that a vehicle can collect. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the movies where electric cars can be weaponised,\u201d he says.\n\nPaterson wants the Australian government to instigate a national security review of Chinese EVs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t allow those companies to become the backbone of our communications network. Why would we let them become the backbone of our transport network?\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Nic Fildes in Sydney, Kana Inagaki and David Keohane in Tokyo, Ding Wenjie and Joe Leahy in Beijing", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c77fefa3-7f47-429b-8149-50aa60f39498"}}, {"id": "956f01ed-9d3f-49cb-93c9-b2f91b452d9e", "event_name": "Four escapes for adventurous souls", "blurb": "Whether you long to explore Japanese temples, Brazilian lagoons or the wilds of Svalbard", "date": "2024-06-0200:00:00.0", "body": "Temple of the senses\n\nApril marked Six Senses\u2019 maiden foray in Japan: the 81-room Six Senses Kyoto opened a few weeks ago, in\u00a0the\u00a0old-world, low-rise Higashiyama district.

Its average projection was for 3mn cases. Multiple states have introduced emergency measures and vaccination programmes.\n\nThe 5.5mn cases registered by this week mark a 240 per cent jump from the 1.6mn recorded in 2023. Last year\u2019s total was already one of the highest levels on record.\n\nTo date this year Brazilian health authorities have reported 3,200 confirmed deaths from dengue, which can cause high fever, muscle pain and internal bleeding. A further 2,700 deaths are being investigated. Brazil\u2019s Federal District, which includes the national capital Bras\u00edlia, has the highest rate of infections.\n\nThe dengue virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which thrives in pools of stagnant water. Chikungunya, another mosquito-borne disease which is present in Brazil, provokes similar symptoms to dengue but is caused by a different virus.\n\nThe World Health Organization has described dengue as a \u201csubstantial public health challenge\u201d, noting a \u201c10-fold surge\u201d in worldwide reported cases from 500,000 a year to 5.2mn between 2000 and 2019.\n\nScientists and medical experts say the surge in cases is being fuelled by higher temperatures linked to climate change and that countries around the world can expect dengue outbreaks in the future. Late last year the WHO warned that there had been reports of indigenous cases in many southern European countries.\n\n\u201cWe used to have five days of anomalous heat [during the summer]. Now there are 20 or 30 days,\u201d said Christovam Barcellos, a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, referring to Brazil\u2019s central regions.\n\n\u201cThis triggers the dengue transmission process, both because of the [spread of the] mosquito and because of the movement of people.\u201d\n\nFelipe Naveca, another researcher at the foundation, said the increase in temperature aided the rapid maturation of virus-carrying mosquitoes, while shifts in rainfall patterns caused by climate change could increase the availability of breeding sites.\n\nThe dengue virus has four serotypes \u2014 or variations \u2014 and infection by one does not create immunity from the others. Health officials have said the current predominant serotype is type 2, against which the Brazilian population is less immunised.\n\nFollowing the surge in cases in the first five months of this year \u2014 Brazil\u2019s summer runs from late December to late March \u2014 the epidemic has shown signs of slowing down as temperatures cool.\n\nAt a press conference this month, Ethel Maciel, the health surveillance secretary at the health ministry, said the growth in cases was no longer \u201cexpressive [but] we still need to remain on alert\u201d.\n\nMaciel added that she expected case numbers to begin to rise again at the end of the year.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b253bc83-03fe-4f58-95c9-e5c805742009"}}, {"id": "17defe6e-e053-48f5-9c9d-b1b2fc5d0829", "event_name": "Orange juice crisis prompts search for alternative fruits", "blurb": "Bad weather and disease in Brazil have pushed futures prices to a record high", "date": "2024-05-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Orange juice prices have soared to record highs, driven by bad weather and disease in Brazil, the world\u2019s largest exporter, prompting manufacturers to explore whether they can use mandarins instead to make the drink.\n\nOrange juice futures \u2014 which allow industry players to hedge against swings in prices \u2014 have been on a tear since the end of 2022 when a hurricane, then a cold snap, devastated acres of orange groves in Florida, the main growing region in the US, the world\u2019s second-biggest producer. But the rally has accelerated sharply this month as the prospect of a dismal harvest in Brazil has panicked the market.\n\nConcentrated orange juice futures, traded on Intercontinental Exchange in New York, hit $4.92 a pound on Tuesday, almost double the price a year ago.\n\n\u201cThis is a crisis,\u201d said Kees Cools, president of the International Fruit and Vegetable Juice Association (IFU). \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like it, even during the big freezes and big hurricanes.\u201d\n\nThe crippling shortages have raised fears of a price rise that will hit consumers and fundamentally reshape the global orange juice industry, according to the IFU.\n\nNormally manufacturers can overcome differences in flavours from one season to another by blending stocks of frozen orange juice \u2014 which has a two-year lifespan \u2014 from the last season with the newer crop. But three consecutive years of dwindling supply have depleted stockpiles.\n\nThe long-term solution to a dearth of oranges, according to Cools, might be to make orange juice from mandarins, whose trees are more resilient to climate change in growing regions.\n\nThe only longer-term option \u201cwithout touching the naturalness and image of the product\u201d might be \u201cto use different species of fruit\u201d, Cools said.\n\nThe industry is already experimenting. In Japan, which normally imports 90 per cent of its orange juice, mostly from fruit grown in Brazil, the supply crunch has been exacerbated by a weak yen, pushing up import costs further. Seven & i Holdings, the owner of supermarket chain 7-Eleven, has turned to the country\u2019s domestic supply of mandarins, launching a mandarin and orange juice product.\n\nThe IFU was considering embarking on the regulatory process to allow the drink to contain citrus fruits other than oranges, Cools said. That would require a legislative change, first in the Codex Alimentarius food standards code established by UN bodies, and then at a national level, such as by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nToday\u2019s supply squeeze dates back 20 years to when citrus greening \u2014 an incurable disease spread by sap-sucking psyllid insects that makes the tree\u2019s fruit bitter before killing it altogether \u2014 was first detected in the US.\n\nBy 2008, it had spread throughout Florida, which historically accounted for more than 80 per cent of US supplies. Two decades ago Florida churned out about 240mn boxes of orange juice a year, according to Cools. Today, exacerbated by climate change, it is down to just 17mn.\n\nBrazil stepped in to make up the shortfall but now the South American agricultural powerhouse is also beginning to struggle. Production this year has fallen by a quarter to 232mn boxes of oranges, according to estimates from Fundecitrus, the citrus growers organisation.\n\nBrazilian orange groves had been battered by higher than average temperatures and below average rainfall, said Andr\u00e9s Padilla, an analyst at Rabobank. Less than a third of farms were irrigated and even they had \u201cstruggled to cope\u201d, he said.\n\nRabobank estimates nearly 40 per cent of orange groves in the main growing region in the south-east of the country are infected with citrus greening.\n\nThe disease also makes the oranges drop earlier, which means farmers tend to harvest before they normally would, again affecting the \u201ctaste profile\u201d, said Padilla, adding that this \u201ccreates challenges for the orange juice industry\u201d.\n\nThe only way to cure the disease was to rip out the tree, \u201cwhich the farmer doesn\u2019t like to do because there are still oranges\u201d, said Cools. \u201cBut yields are bad and the quality [of the fruit] is bad.\u201d\n\nIndustry executives say consumers are therefore likely to feel the impact for years. Many manufacturers are already passing on rising costs to their customers.\n\n\u201cDue to those turbulent and uncertain factors both globally and in the UK, we have had to review the prices and sizes of our drinks,\u201d said Sarah Baldwin, chief executive of Purity Soft Drinks.\n\nMeanwhile, consumer demand shows no sign of easing. Before the coronavirus pandemic, some Americans had ditched orange juice, troubled by its sugar content, and switched to supplements to get their daily dose of vitamin C, said Jack Scoville, a broker at Price Futures Group in Chicago. But \u201cduring Covid a lot of people discovered juice again\u201d, he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Michael Pooler in S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nKeeping shelves stocked through a supply crisis\u00a0/\u00a0From Ian Thompson, Vice-President, Northern Europe, Ivalua", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/31400087-5749-4cbe-94ee-5ad87b1bb9aa"}}, {"id": "045a8e30-5495-4bd4-ac83-4d12dc304b96", "event_name": "Carmakers electrify Brazil\u2019s unique sugarcane vehicles", "blurb": "Manufacturers are betting on \u2018flex-fuel hybrid\u2019 as South American nation charts alternative path to decarbonisation ", "date": "2024-05-2700:00:00.0", "body": "As the global automotive industry turns to vehicles powered by batteries containing minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, manufacturers in Brazil believe the future of cleaner cars lies in a combination of 21st century electric technology and an old world commodity: sugar.\n\nMost passenger cars sold in Latin America\u2019s largest economy are capable of running on a mix of petrol and lower-emission ethanol, a biofuel which in Brazil is mainly derived from sugarcane.\n\nMultinational carmakers including Stellantis, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and China\u2019s Great Wall Motor are investing billions of dollars to add a degree of electrification to these so-called flexible fuel cars.\n\nThe wager is on a technological variant virtually unique to the South American nation: biofuel versions of hybrid cars, which use both a traditional internal combustion engine and an electric motor for propulsion.\n\nSuch vehicles are known as \u201cflex hybrids\u201d. Brazil\u2019s car industry casts the unusual category as an important stepping stone in the quest to reduce carbon dioxide pollution from tailpipes.\n\nHowever, some environmentalists question whether the cleaner credentials of ethanol in fact threatens to hinder the country\u2019s adoption of fully battery run cars \u2014 the \u201ccleanest\u201d vehicles of all.\n\nRoberto Braun, director of environmental, social and governance at Toyota do Brasil, described flexible-fuel hybrid technology as \u201cthe best and most suitable\u201d for the country.\n\n\u201cA flex hybrid vehicle in Brazil fuelled with ethanol has very similar CO\u2082 emissions to an electric vehicle powered by electricity in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cAs Brazil is a major player in biofuels, it has an alternative [path to] decarbonisation beyond what other countries are considering\u201d.\n\nHaving launched the world\u2019s first flex-fuel hybrid there in 2019 and with 75,000 sold to date, the Japanese company plans to unveil another two such models over the next few years under a R$11bn ($2.1bn) capital spending package announced in March. Flex hybrids feature across a recent wave of investment promises to upgrade Brazilian vehicles. Carmakers have pledged some R$77bn to the country in 2024 alone, sparking hopes of a revival in the sector after a decade of stagnation.\n\nBraun noted the flex hybrid model is \u201ca practical technology because it does not require electrical recharging or any change in consumer habits\u201d.\n\n\u201cHybrid-flex costs around 10 to 15 per cent more than a normal flex vehicle in the same category, so it is not very far off in terms of price,\u201d he added.\n\nDefenders of ethanol, which is available at all filling stations in Brazil, say it is a viable low-carbon option in a developing economy where the higher prices of EVs are prohibitive for most consumers. The sugarcane-based fuel can lower CO\u2082 emissions by 73 per cent compared with petrol, according to a 2009 study by Brazil\u2019s state-run agricultural research institute, Embrapa.\n\nAt the same time, Brazil\u2019s size and varied terrain makes the rollout of charging infrastructure an enormous challenge.\n\nHowever, some environmentalists argue the biofuel\u2019s prominence threatens to hinder the adoption of fully-battery run cars.\n\nBrazil is the seventh-largest car market globally but trails richer countries on EVs. While sales of battery-run vehicles and hybrids almost doubled in 2023 to 94,000, they only made up 4.3 per cent of all passenger and light commercial vehicle deliveries.\n\n\u201cThe longer Brazil commits to ethanol, the higher its chance of becoming a laggard in this new technological paradigm,\u201d said Luciana Castilla, an energy transition researcher at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nIf manufacturers and buyers stick with flex vehicles, the corollary is that the industry could struggle to achieve the economies of scale required to bring down the costs of full EVs to more affordable levels, sceptics argue.\n\nBrazil\u2019s love affair with ethanol goes back to the 1970s, when the international oil crisis led the military dictatorship to promote the biofuel. Sugarcane plantations were a cornerstone of Portuguese colonisation and remain an important industry today.\n\nSince flex-fuel cars were first introduced two decades ago by VW, they have come to account for about 90 per cent of overall passenger vehicle sales \u2014 resulting in the biggest fleet in the world.\n\nEven motorists who do not fill up on pure ethanol end up burning it, because by law petrol must be blended with 27 per cent of the biofuel, the highest level mandated globally. Other markets use lower ethanol blending, such as a 10 per cent ethanol-gasoline mix common in the UK, Thailand and US.\n\nIf green campaigners worry flex-fuel hybrids might hold back more advanced electrification, BYD and Toyota are looking to push the technology forward by designing \u201cplug-in\u201d versions, which are further up the electrification scale than a normal flex hybrid.\n\n\u201cWe will soon have the launch of this model, technologically developed in Brazil and increasing the performance and autonomy of a car powered by ethanol,\u201d said BYD\u2019s local chair Alexandre Baldy.\n\nWhereas regular hybrids do not require external charging and are more reliant on the combustion engine, plug-in hybrids offer dozens of miles of driving in electric-only mode.\n\nYet doubts exist about the environmental effectiveness of the focus on flex hybrids, even those of the plug-in variety.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Cieplinski, a researcher at the non-profit International Council on Clean Transportation, described it as a \u201crisky route\u201d, noting studies suggested emissions reductions from plug-in hybrids were lower than thought.\n\n\u201cAdopting strategies now that have a more limited mitigation potential could result in rushed and more costly policies in the future if we are to meet [Brazil\u2019s] net zero goal by 2050,\u201d he added.\n\nThe industry\u2019s wider bet is that the different technologies on offer to Brazilian motorists will help spur a new era for national carmaking, following numerous factory closures in recent times. Against the backdrop of long-running economic malaise, the sector has struggled to recover to 2013\u2019s peak output of just under 3mn passenger cars, with 1.8mn units manufactured last year.\n\nAlthough globally flex-fuel vehicles are relatively niche \u2014 the US, Canada and Sweden are other notable markets \u2014 proponents in Brazil see potential for exporting them to neighbouring Paraguay and India, where officials believe the biofuel can lessen oil imports.\n\nDespite its national preference for sugarcane cars, Brazil is pushing ahead with production of full battery electric vehicles (BEV). BYD plans to begin assembly by the end of this year, with full domestic production by mid-2025.\n\nThe Chinese group, which is the world\u2019s leading EV maker by volume, is setting up its first car factory outside Asia in the Brazilian state of Bahia and recently increased its investment budget to R$5.5bn.\n\nThe most complex and expensive part of electric cars is the battery, which for now will be imported to Brazil. But as the country begins large-scale lithium mining, Bras\u00edlia\u2019s eventual aspiration is for domestic manufacture of this key component.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be demand and scale for it not to be too expensive,\u201d said Ricardo Bastos, president of the Brazilian Association of Electric Vehicles who is also a director at Great Wall Motor. \u201cBrazil cannot get stuck in combustion technology,\u201d he added. \u201cThe world is already demanding electric cars, so we will have to be able to produce them here.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/43b7ceef-bd55-4980-8571-647b6224a4d4"}}, {"id": "f51ea27e-7d2a-4f1c-b34c-d4785187fd07", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s supreme court overturns \u2018Car Wash\u2019 corruption convictions", "blurb": "Reversal of high-profile rulings comes as country backtracks on graft probe", "date": "2024-05-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s supreme court has quashed convictions against two high-profile figures targeted by the political corruption investigation known as \u201cCar Wash\u201d, dealing a severe blow to the legacy of the probe that rocked Latin America\u2019s largest democracy.\n\nThe court on Tuesday evening overturned a 2017 conviction against Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, a leftwing politician and longtime ally of president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, on the grounds that a limitation period had expired.\n\nA single justice on the country\u2019s top tribunal also annulled rulings against industrialist Marcelo Odebrecht, who in 2016 was found guilty of offences including bribery and money laundering.\n\nTogether, the decisions are another nail in the coffin of Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato, or \u201cOperation Car Wash\u201d, which began in 2014 and uncovered a multi-billion-dollar kickback scheme that siphoned money from state-controlled oil major Petrobras.\n\nA cartel of construction companies systematically paid bribes to officials and Petrobras executives in exchange for contracts, according to investigators, in what the US Department of Justice described as the \u201clargest foreign bribery case in history\u201d.\n\nDozens of politicians and businessmen were jailed as Car Wash earned plaudits at home and abroad for exposing widespread graft at the highest levels of Brazilian politics and business.\n\nHowever, the methods involved were labelled improper by those targeted, while critics called it a politically motivated witch hunt against the country\u2019s left.\n\nA series of recent supreme court orders have threatened to roll back the investigation\u2019s achievements, leading some to warn about a return of impunity.\n\nFilipe Campante, associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, said the latest rulings were \u201csymbolic of the utter defeat and reversal\u201d of Car Wash.\n\n\u201cBefore Lava Jato, it was completely unthinkable that certain players would ever face prison,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat these decisions seem to establish is that things have not changed.\u201d\n\nBy three votes to two, the court on Tuesday overturned Dirceu\u2019s conviction for receiving bribes between 2009 and 2012 from a company that contracted with Petrobras. His lawyers argued that the conviction was not valid \u2014 he was over 70 years old at sentencing, which reduces the statute of limitation period for the offence by half to six years.\n\nHe had been sentenced to almost nine years in prison. Dirceu, who had multiple different convictions with jail sentences attached, spent time in and out of prison pending appeals but is no longer behind bars.\n\nA leftwing activist in the 1960s, Dirceu was deported by Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship and sought exile in Cuba, where he underwent plastic surgery to alter his appearance in order to return to his homeland undetected.\n\nOnce considered Lula\u2019s right-hand man, the 78-year-old has another outstanding corruption conviction that is under reconsideration by a separate court. If that conviction too is reversed, it could open the door for him to stand for election.\n\nOne of the justices who voted in favour of the annulment, Ricardo Lewandowski, has since retired from the bench and joined Lula\u2019s government as justice minister.\n\nThe eponymous family enterprise of Marcelo Odebrecht, which is formerly South America\u2019s largest construction conglomerate, was identified by prosecutors as a key player at the centre of the bribery scheme.\n\nA lower court in 2016 imposed on the executive a 19-year custodial sentence, which was later reduced, and he spent two years in prison before transferring to house arrest, which ended last year.\n\nThose rulings were annulled on Tuesday by Justice Dias Toffoli. In Odebrecht\u2019s case he found there was \u201ccollusion\u201d between the magistrates and prosecutors and that proper legal process had been ignored.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear there was a\u00a0mixing of the prosecutorial and judicial functions, eroding the foundations of the democratic criminal process,\u201d the justice wrote in his ruling.\n\nA plea bargain struck between the scion of the construction dynasty and anti-corruption task force, however, remained intact. The company previously admitted to making illegal payments.\n\nToffoli last year nullified vast amounts of evidence obtained during the Car Wash probe, saying investigators had \u201cdisrespected due legal process and acted with bias\u201d.\n\nIn recent months, he has suspended fines for corruption scandals imposed as part of leniency agreements on Novonor \u2014 the successor company to Odebrecht \u2014 and J&F, the holding entity for the Batista family, which controls meatpacker JBS.\n\nAnti-corruption campaigners said the latest rulings were detrimental to the rule of law in Brazil.\n\n\u201cThe destruction of the fight against corruption in the country is relentless,\u201d NGO Transparency International said on X.\n\nIts country manager, Bruno Brand\u00e3o, said: \u201cThis further undermines the credibility of the Judiciary in society, which has serious implications for democratic stability.

[Musk] might be a piece of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are fighting powerful enemies of democracy,\u201d the top judge told the Financial Times. \u201cAnd some people invoke freedom of expression when truly they are defending a business model based on engagement and, unfortunately, hatred, sensationalism [and] conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nBarroso, speaking in Rio de Janeiro on the sidelines of the J20, a summit of the heads of G20 supreme courts, said the far-right movement was \u201ctrying to create a problem that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d with claims of censorship.\n\n\u201cFor the truth, visit X.com!\u201d Musk said in an email when contacted about Barroso\u2019s comments.\n\nMusk\u2019s earlier comments were seized upon by the Brazilian right, including supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who have adopted the Tesla chief executive as a talismanic figure.\n\nAfter Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered X to block several accounts last month, without specifying the precise grounds for the order, Musk responded that the justice was a \u201cdictator\u201d and posted images mocking him online.\n\nMusk initially said the platform would not comply with the court orders, arguing they violated Brazilian laws. X later reversed course and agreed to comply, but is appealing against the court\u2019s decision.\n\nMusk\u2019s initial threats not to comply led De Moraes to include the billionaire in a long-running investigation into the activities of so-called \u201cdigital militias\u201d.\n\nOver the past several years the Supreme Court has pushed to tackle far-right movements, focusing on ordering social media platforms to remove disinformation and accounts seen to be inciting violence or actions against the democratic state.\n\nThis, however, has given rise to claims of judicial over-reach and censorship, particularly as those who have their accounts taken offline have little or sometimes no way to appeal against the decision.\n\nAs evidence of the risks to Brazilian democracy, Barroso pointed to a recent federal police investigation, which alleges that Bolsonaro and several senior military officers developed detailed plans for a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat following the former president\u2019s election defeat in 2022. The alleged plot eventually fizzled out and Bolsonaro denies any wrongdoing.\n\nBarroso also highlighted the riots in Bras\u00edlia in January last year, when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed and vandalised Congress, the supreme court and the presidential palace. Many of the rioters demanded the military intervene to overturn the election of current leftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\n\u201cPeople that think we exaggerated must know what kind of forces we had to fight.

The mistake is the assumption that in order to defend democracy you must allow or tolerate the infringement of fundamental constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nBarroso admitted it was difficult to know where to draw the line between freedom of expression and attacks on democracy, saying \u201cit will always depend on the risks you are running\u201d.\n\nBut he said incitement to violence against the state was unacceptable.\n\n\u201cYou can criticise the Supreme Court and say I don\u2019t like it.

Mud swamped a 5km tract of land in front of the dam, while rivers dozens of kilometres away were polluted.\n\n\u201cI lost my [pregnant] sister; I lost friends; my niece never had the chance to be born,\u201d says Josiane Melo, a former employee of the mine who escaped the incident because she was on a leave day.\n\nNamed after the local township, the Brumadinho disaster was one of Brazil\u2019s worst industrial and environmental tragedies. It sparked a reckoning not only for Vale, the Rio de Janeiro-based mining group that ran the facility, but also the wider industry and its use of often perilous tailings dams. Such dams are embankments built in mining areas to facilitate storage of the waste \u2014 tailings \u2014 generated from processing ore.\n\nLarge institutional investors, including the Church of England Pensions Board, banded together to demand that mining companies adhere to a new global standard for safety and transparency. Brazilian prosecutors and legislators also successfully promoted and passed new laws phasing out the use of upstream tailings dams.\n\nToday, Brumadinho still seethes with anger and grief; almost everyone knows a victim. Survivors, such as Melo, are sharply critical of how Vale handled the disaster and the subsequent issue of reparations. But those working in the industry say the tragedy has led to some progress.\n\n\u201cBrumadinho was the biggest environmental and human disaster in the history of Brazil, but it brought a historic milestone in dam safety,\u201d says Carlos Eduardo Ferreira Pinto, a public prosecutor from Minas Gerais, referring to the so-called \u201cSea of Mud, Never Again\u201d law passed in 2019.\n\nThis legislation prohibits the construction in Brazil of upstream tailings dams and requires that existing structures be decommissioned. The last such dam in Minas Gerais should be closed by 2035, according to Ferreira Pinto.\n\nUpstream tailings dams, such as that at C\u00f3rrego do Feij\u00e3o, are considered more risky than downstream dams. Building methods used for upstream dams differ from those downstream. The upstream method is cheaper but, experts say, leaves a dam\u2019s structure more vulnerable to instability if the stored waste becomes too wet.\n\nVale says it has decommissioned 13 upstream structures to date \u201cin line with our plan to eliminate [our] 30 by 2035\u201d. The company has spent R$7bn ($1.4bn) on the programme since 2019.\n\nVicente Mello, a vice-president with environmental services group Aecom, which is auditing the safety of Brazilian mining dams, says legislators were able to move quickly with the 2019 law because discussions had already taken place following a separate dam collapse in 2015 in the nearby Mariana township. That disaster killed 19.\n\n\u201cWhat Brumadinho did was to say: \u2018Listen, this is bigger than just one site, this is a larger issue\u2019,\u201d says Mello. \u201cBrazil is the only country that has not only prohibited upstream tailings dams, but [said] they have to be removed.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the increased scrutiny from regulators and prosecutors following the Brumadinho disaster revealed many more potentially dangerous dams than had been previously identified.\n\nAt the time of the disaster, only three mining dams nationwide were considered on any state of alert. In January this year, the number was 92, according to the National Mining Agency.\n\nMello\u2019s cautious optimism is echoed by Adam Matthews, chief responsible investment officer of the Church of England Pensions Board, which \u2014 alongside several large European institutional investors \u2014 divested itself of Vale shares following the disaster.\n\nMatthews has been at the front of the development of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management, which sets out best practice in a broad array of areas \u2014 from public disclosure requirements to what to do in emergencies and how to engage with affected communities.\n\n\u201cMy sense is we\u2019re in a very different place to where we were five years ago,\u201d says Matthews. \u201cA significant part of the industry is now quite clearly committed to a new path of implementing a global industry standard that didn\u2019t exist before.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has required real change in their approach to tailings,\u201d he adds, pointing out that 65 per cent of the industry, by market capitalisation, had committed to the standard \u2014 including Vale.\n\nShortly after the disaster, prosecutors alleged that Vale had been aware of structural problems with the dam and had failed to prevent its collapse. F\u00e1bio Schvartsman, then chief executive, was indicted for qualified homicide and environmental crimes. But the case did not progress and was suspended this year, angering families of the victims.\n\n\u201cTo date, no one has been tried, despite 16 people being indicted \u2014 no one went to prison,\u201d says Melo.\n\nVale says it has been \u201ccontinuously improving the management of its mining dams\u201d and that its plan is to have no structure in a critical safety condition by next year.\n\nIn 2021, Vale also signed an agreement with the federal government to pay BR$37.7bn to repair \u201cBrumadinho and municipalities affected by the collapse\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009with a view to improving the population\u2019s quality of life\u201d. About 70 per cent of the sum has been disbursed. A further R$3.5bn has been paid as compensation to 15,400 people who signed indemnity agreements with the company.\n\nHowever, Melo remains critical of Vale\u2019s attitude towards the disaster. \u201cReal reparations are when you admit that you were wrong and go on to write a new chapter. Vale still hasn\u2019t admitted that it was a crime.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/16b6d5a6-761a-41fd-935f-6b4e11cad32a"}}, {"id": "cf629691-cd45-414a-a906-0930dca45a78", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s lithium makes its presence known with silvery-white promise", "blurb": "Minas Gerais deposits of the mineral are turning a once forlorn region of the state into a prospecting hotspot", "date": "2024-05-1500:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s Jequitinhonha Valley, a remote expanse of hills, scrubby mountains and dusty roads, was once so poor it was known as \u201cMisery Valley\u201d. Now, local politicians and mining entrepreneurs dream of it being known by a different sobriquet: Lithium Valley.\n\nThe discovery of significant deposits of the silvery-white metal have turned this corner of northeastern Minas Gerais state into a hotspot on the global hunt for what is an essential ingredient of the rechargeable batteries that power phones, laptops and electric vehicles.\n\nIn Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed, a municipality of 34,000 where a mine operated by Toronto-listed Sigma Lithium recently opened, buildings springing up are evidence of money and outsiders flooding in. \u201cIt was always a quiet little town. Now, there\u2019s so much movement,\u201d says Pedro Martins Lage, whose family-run hotel is doubling its number of rooms. \u201cIt\u2019s not going back to the way it was before.\u201d\n\nThe great hope in the sun-baked Jequitinhonha Valley \u2014 twice the size of Switzerland and with a population of about 1mn \u2014 is that the natural resource can transform its fortunes. With a number of other companies prospecting in the area, investments of R$6.8bn ($1.3bn) have been committed over the past five years, say state officials.\n\nAround half the world\u2019s lithium currently comes from hard rock mining in Australia. But the greatest concentration of deposits are found in Bolivia, Argentina and Chile \u2014 the so-called \u201clithium triangle\u201d \u2014 where it is extracted from brines in evaporation ponds. Although Brazil\u2019s known quantities are smaller, those in Minas Gerais are of high purity, according to the federal government.\n\nJequitinhonha Valley\u2019s hard rock deposits give Brazil the chance to be an key supplier, reckons Daniel Jimenez, founding partner of consultancy iLiMarkets. \u201cThere\u2019s untapped exploration potential there,\u201d he says. Minas Gerais is \u201ca very favourable mining jurisdiction\u201d.\n\nMen from the valley often used to travel away to work but Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed townspeople say lithium and the trade it has spurred \u2014 from accommodation to catering \u2014 are making that a thing of the past. \u201cNow, people only leave if they want to,\u201d says Eliana Pereira dos Santos, kneading dough in her kitchen for the pastries she makes for a living.\n\nThrough a microcredit scheme run for local women by Sigma Lithium, she received a R$2,000 loan to replace a broken oven and says her sales have risen 70 per cent: \u201cI see a bright future here. I believe it will be a first-world town. Everyone will come out winning\u201d.\n\nAlongside the excitement are the tell-tale strains of a boom town, with some residents pointing to a rising cost of living. Others worry about public services and wonder how far any newfound wealth will spread.\n\nGilvan Gomes Caldeira, serving drinks at a bus station kiosk, is glad his son found work in lithium but rent rises mean his daughter cannot find her own place to live. A lot of employment is being created, he says, but landlords do not want to rent to locals. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been at the end of the world in our little town, but not anymore\u201d.\n\nIn previous decades, lithium was extracted by the Companhia Brasileira do L\u00edtio on a small scale. Over the past five years, however, the company has quadrupled its annual output.\n\nSigma Lithium\u2019s Grota do Cirilo project, which dispatched its first shipment of lithium concentrate almost a year ago bound for China, is considered a game-changer. The company was the sixth-largest primary lithium supplier globally in 2023, says commodity consultancy CRU.\n\nStanding above a deep open pit carved in terraces, where yellow excavators dig, chief executive Ana Cabral-Gardner explains why Sigma calls its product \u201cgreen\u201d. It uses no potable water or hazardous chemicals at its processing plant, which runs on renewable power. Nor are there tailings dams \u2014 structures for storing mining waste, two of which have burst to devastating effect elsewhere in Minas Gerais over the past decade.\n\n\u201cWe became an example of what Brazil can be in this 21st century new industrialisation process,\u201d she says, noting that Sigma has created 1,000 jobs and 85 per cent of the workforce are locals. Most had lived outside the area and were recruited through a \u201chomecoming\u201d campaign.\n\nHowever, in the hillside village of Piau\u00ed Po\u00e7o Dantas, overlooking the site, some residents complain about the environmental impact. \u201cThere\u2019s so much noise and dust,\u201d says one, \u201cit\u2019s worsened the quality of life. We are very unhappy with the situation.\u201d\n\nSigma says it monitors noise, vibration and dust and that levels are \u201csignificantly below\u201d legal limits and best practice standards. It points to its renovation of a local school and sports facility as evidence of its civic engagement.\n\nStill, wider concerns are voiced about whether the region is equipped to deal with a big rise in mineral activity. Aline Weber Sulzbacher, researcher at the Federal University of the Valleys of Jequitinhonha and Mucuri (UFVJM), says higher prices have led some families to move to the outskirts of Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed. She points to \u201cthe rapid deterioration of highways and increased demand on the health system\u201d.\n\nVisitors need only drive the 45km on the federal highway between Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed and the neighbouring municipality of Itinga. Cars zigzag to avoid massive potholes, which motorists blame on trucks loaded with logs for pulp mills. \u201cThere are fears about public safety, too, because we were a small town with practically nothing and all of a sudden there\u2019s all this money and mining,\u201d says Itinga\u2019s mayor, Jo\u00e3o Bosco.\n\nHe is optimistic that lithium sales will in the long run help fund public services like sewerage, health and education. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to think about financial reserves to create a regional sovereign wealth fund.\u201d\n\nThe commodity remains vulnerable to market volatility, though.

Lithium\u2019s value is down about four-fifths from a peak of around $15,000 per tonne in late 2022, says data group Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nBut Sigma Lithium appears undeterred. It recently unveiled plans to make a sizeable increase in annual output capacity.\n\nAnd another company, US-based Atlas Lithium, aims to begin production in Ara\u00e7ua\u00ed by the end of 2024. \u201cThe Valley of Jequitinhonha has the potential to become one of the most efficient producers in the world\u201d, argues chief executive Marc Fogassa.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/944c61c5-a5f7-42ae-909e-f45eb9dd0f70"}}, {"id": "bc22bc60-f5a8-4916-9418-632d1b018957", "event_name": "The governor who is a dark horse for Brazil\u2019s next presidential race", "blurb": "Minas Gerais businessman-turned-politician Romeu Zema plays down talk of 2026 bid, but analysts are not convinced", "date": "2024-05-1500:00:00.0", "body": "Romeu Zema was running the family retailing group he inherited from his father when Brazil\u2019s worst recession on record hit, forcing him to fire a third of the 7,500-strong workforce to survive.\n\n\u201cIn those two years, 2015 and 2016, I saw that it was no good being an efficient businessman and creating a good company if the country where you are is on the road to becoming the next Venezuela,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat was the main reason I went into politics.\u201d\n\nThe following year, Zema accepted an invitation to run for governor of Minas Gerais, Brazil\u2019s second-most populous state. A political outsider, he racked up 60,000km criss-crossing a territory larger than France, campaigning in more than 200 towns and cities \u2014 and won the election easily.\n\nRe-elected as governor in 2022, Zema, 59, has brought a no-nonsense, pro-business focus to the job, which he says has helped secure record levels of investment.\n\n\u201cIn the past, there was a lot of ill will [towards business],\u201d Zema says, referring to the leftwing administrations that preceded his. \u201cThe last [state] government attracted R$26bn ($5bn) while we, in five years and three months of government, have already drawn R$409bn ($77.8bn).\u201d\n\nOne of the main areas of investment has been solar energy, with capacity growing from 500 megawatts in 2018 to 8 gigawatts this month \u2014 enough to power more than 5mn homes. On a bright day, Minas Gerais generates half as much electricity from the sun\u2019s rays as is produced by Brazil\u2019s Itaipu hydroelectric dam, the third-biggest in the world.\n\nMining remains a mainstay of the state\u2019s economy, with Zema actively encouraging fresh projects, particularly in lithium, the metal crucial for making electric vehicle and mobile phone batteries. Critics argue that Zema pays too little attention to public services and his mining policies come at an environmental cost. A majority of the state\u2019s voters seem happy, though: the most recent poll from Quaest put his approval rating at 62 per cent, with 31 per cent disapproving.\n\nZema also aims to tackle the R$165bn of debt the state owes the federal government \u2014 a burden from previous administrations which, he says, severely limits his ability to invest as much as he would like in highways and public services. A high rate of interest on the debt \u2014 consumer inflation plus 4 percentage points \u2014 makes it \u201cunpayable\u201d, he argues.\n\nPresident Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva comes from the opposite side of the political spectrum to Zema and the Minas governor is openly critical of Lula\u2019s economic policy. Growing federal deficits are a \u201ctime bomb\u201d, Zema says, adding that the president\u2019s team is \u201cmore concerned with rewriting history than with heading towards the future\u201d.\n\nThat has not stopped him from meeting Lula in Minas this year, or from making a trip to Bras\u00edlia to renegotiate the debt. One suggestion touted by finance minister Fernando Haddad is that the federal government would reduce the interest in return for states investing more in technical education.\n\nAnother idea, proposed by Rodrigo Pacheco, federal senate president, is for Minas to hand over its stake in electricity group Cemig \u2014 which is an important producer to the national grid and has Minas as its largest shareholder \u2014 to the federal government, in return for debt pardons. Some observers say Lula is keen to help Minas ahead of the 2026 elections in the hope of winning back the state for his Workers\u2019 party (PT), or for a political ally. Pacheco hails from Minas and is said to be keen to run for the governorship in 2026.\n\nMinas is evenly split, politically, between left and right \u2014 but Zema, who is a member of the pro-business Partido Novo, campaigned next to former president Jair Bolsonaro in the latter\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to win re-election in 2022. Despite Bolsonaro\u2019s legal difficulties, including allegations that he was involved in attempts to organise a coup after losing the election, Zema remains close to the hard-right leader.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro represents the right in Brazil very well,\u201d Zema insists. \u201cHe had the merit of waking up the right, which had hardly existed until that moment\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he will have a very big role to play in the municipal elections [this year] and in the 2026 presidential election.\u201d But, with Bolsonaro out of the running for the next presidential race \u2014 he was banned last year from running for political office until 2030 for spreading misinformation about the electoral system during the 2022 poll \u2014 the right will seek a new candidate to run against the PT in two years\u2019 time. Could it be Zema?\n\nThe governor insists not, saying there are plenty of other candidates: fellow conservative governors, such as Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas in S\u00e3o Paulo, Ratinho J\u00fanior in Paran\u00e1 or Ronaldo Caiado in Goi\u00e1s. \u201cI would prefer to support one of those names than be the name,\u201d he says.\n\nNot all are convinced. \u201cZema was elected on the premise that he would be more of a manager than a politician [but] after several years in office, it appears to be the opposite: his public policies are poor but he has proved to be a very skilled politician,\u201d says Miguel Corr\u00eaa do Lago, executive director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies in Rio de Janeiro, citing the weakening of environmental safeguards despite two mining disasters in the state. \u201cMaybe he does have national potential.

Very small amounts confer greater toughness, corrosion resistance and higher melting points.\n\nFound in everything from automobile bodies to gas pipelines and atomic reactors, niobium is also used in high-tech devices such as jet engines and hospital MRI scanners.\n\nAmid an international rush to secure raw commodities deemed vital for modern technologies, there is growing scrutiny of the strategic and geopolitical facets to niobium \u2014 not least since production is concentrated in just a few places.\n\nThe shiny grey metal is ranked the second-most \u201ccritical mineral\u201d by the US Geological Survey, which estimates that 90 per cent of total output is from Brazil.\n\n\u201cOur country can be positioned as a very important supplier of materials for the energy transition,\u201d says CBMM chief executive Ricardo Lima. \u201cThe most important property we can bring is fast charging,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn the battery industry, we really have a great opportunity to be very successful.\u201d\n\nFounded in the 1950s and controlled by the Moreira Salles business dynasty, CBMM\u2019s other shareholders are a Japanese-Korean grouping and a consortium of Chinese steelmakers.\n\nBrazil\u2019s other dedicated niobium mine was purchased by China\u2019s CMOC in 2016. China is the main destination for Brazilian exports of the metal.\n\nA report by the Washington DC-based think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) this year highlights this level of Chinese involvement, and the substance\u2019s potential in military equipment, as reasons for US policymakers to be on alert. \u201cIn the grand chessboard of defence geopolitics, niobium has emerged as a piece of paramount importance,\u201d write the researchers.\n\nWith its usage long established in aerospace and astronautics \u2014 from the Nasa Apollo programme to SpaceX rockets \u2014 they described the metal as \u201cindispensable\u201d for critical components in hypersonic missiles. Capable of travelling five times the speed of sound, the weaponry is being developed by a number of nations, including the US and China.\n\nHenry Ziemer, one of CSIS report\u2019s authors, says action is needed by US authorities to avert any future disruption to niobium supplies. \u201cNiobium has flown under the radar,\u201d he argues. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a systematic effort from the US to secure the supply chain, align incentives and raise the alarm,\u201d he adds, referring to the degree of Chinese ownership of niobium mines.\n\nCBMM assuages concerns over possible supply issues. Its ability to produce 150,000 tonnes a year of ferroniobium alloy \u2014 the main form in which the metal is sold \u2014 exceeds worldwide demand, according to the company. \u201cIt\u2019s not something critical like it\u2019s rare, or there\u2019s limits on production [or] there could soon be shortages,\u201d says chief technology officer Rafael Mesquita. \u201cThere are other deposits in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the management of our company is done here,\u201d adds Lima. \u201cIt\u2019s not by the Chinese shareholders, it\u2019s by us. I don\u2019t see any concern about the Chinese.\u201d As to niobium\u2019s role in defence, CBMM executives say it is not a target market.\n\nStill, even though the steel industry is set to remain CBMM\u2019s core customer, the company wants to boost new business lines to 30 per cent of overall revenues by 2030, up from 10 per cent today. It sees areas like advanced glass for solar panels to fungicides and special magnetic materials as promising.\n\n\u201cNiobium is quite a new element compared to others like iron, chromium and molybdenum, so there\u2019s still a lot of applications to be developed,\u201d notes Mesquita. \u201cInstead of a larger [market] share, we want to have a bigger cake\u201d.\n\nSupplying battery-grade niobium oxide for commercial vehicles is key to CBMM\u2019s approach. Next month, it is to unveil the world\u2019s first EV with a battery containing the compound: a prototype bus in partnership with Volkswagen and Toshiba. It hopes that real-life versions will be on the roads by 2025.\n\nIn the anode (negative) end of a battery, niobium can replace graphite, enabling quicker charging while reducing the risk of overheating and explosions, CBMM says. \u201cCompared to graphite, it is more expensive,\u201d notes Lima. \u201cBut, as you have a longer battery life, if you can drive for a longer range, the final cost of ownership to the customer is better.\u201d\n\nIn the cathode (positive) end of nickel-based batteries, the company says small amounts of niobium can lessen the need for cobalt. Amnesty International reports that the mining of it in Africa has led to forced eviction of communities and other human rights abuses. Some electric carmakers have now pledged to reduce cobalt\u2019s usage.\n\n\u201cCathodes could be quite a significant market over time for niobium,\u201d says Andrew Matheson at metals consultancy CPM Group. \u201cOn the anode side, it\u2019s still too early to say there\u2019ll be mass adoption, but it\u2019s a strong prospect. Mining trucks alone could eventually represent as much as the current amount going into steel.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/486100f4-5016-4bc4-b5a8-cd4ef9a19181"}}, {"id": "e56a2e84-a53f-4429-8a38-2c7b824d54be", "event_name": "Belo Horizonte looks to tech and quality of life to revive spirits", "blurb": "The Minas Gerais state capital, Brazil\u2019s first large planned city, confronts its 21st century challenges", "date": "2024-05-1500:00:00.0", "body": "Sprawling, cavernous mines pockmark the landscape as you come in to land at Belo Horizonte\u2019s main airport, about an hour\u2019s drive north of the city. It is a fitting vista for the capital of Minas Gerais, a state whose name literally means General Mines.\n\nMining has been the driving force of the region dating back to a 17th century gold rush and still exerts outsized influence. But Belo Horizonte, a hilly city of 2.3mn people known for its hospitality and thriving culinary scene, was never a mining city. At least it didn\u2019t spring directly from a mine.\n\nBelo Horizonte \u2014 or BH as locals simply call it \u2014 was Brazil\u2019s Republican project. After overthrowing the monarchy at the end of the 19th century, the First Republic\u2019s leaders wanted a new city to encapsulate their positivist slogan of \u201cOrder and Progress\u201d \u2014 a motto that is still emblazoned on the country\u2019s national flag to this day.\n\nThe result was BH \u2014 pronounced beh-agah in Portuguese \u2014 the nation\u2019s first large planned city, inspired by Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann\u2019s renovation of Paris and by Washington DC\u2019s traffic circles and diagonal boulevards. The streets and avenues in the city centre were named after Brazilian states and indigenous peoples in an effort to reinforce the country\u2019s new identity.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the Republic is part of our history; the ideals are part of our culture,\u201d says Bruno Carazza, a political analyst and professor at the Dom Cabral Foundation in Belo Horizonte. \u201cThe city centre in BH is inspired by this idea of order and progress.\u201d\n\nFor much of the 20th century, BH and the state of Minas Gerais figured prominently on the national stage. The region was a hub for Brazil\u2019s early industrialisation, led by the mining, steel and automotive sectors. BH also punched above its weight, politically. Key leaders of the era, among them President Juscelino Kubitschek and President-elect Tancredo Neves, who died in 1985 shortly before his inauguration, earned their stripes in the cut and thrust of mineiro politics.\n\nBut, today, Belo Horizonte appears to be struggling. Mining remains important, although less consequential than it once was, while carmakers have shed jobs because of automation.\n\nThe city remains an important educational hub, particularly its highly regarded Federal University of Minas Gerais. But the words on many people\u2019s lips are \u201cbrain drain\u201d. Well-educated mineiros are flocking to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s commercial and financial capital, or to emerging tech hubs in the country\u2019s south, such as Florian\u00f3polis.\n\nAfter surging throughout the 20th century, the population of Belo Horizonte fell in the last census to 2.31mn, down from a peak of 2.37mn in 2010.\u201d People study here and then leave,\u201d says Gabriel Azevedo, a city councillor widely tipped to contest mayoral elections later this year. \u201cBH was built to be a city of the future, with planned and advanced urbanism, which represented a new era of development for the country. But that is behind us and we seem doomed to mediocrity.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to remedy the situation, BH has sought to develop its tech credentials and last year opened an innovation hub in the city\u2019s technology park. It has benefited from the presence of Google \u2014 which runs an engineering centre \u2014 as well as research and development divisions of several large companies, including global steelmaker ArcelorMittal and Brazilian digital bank, Inter.\n\nCritics say the local government has not offered enough resources, either in the form of investments or tax incentives, for projects to really take off.\n\n\u201cI believe that the city can become a hub for attracting new investments, especially in the areas of digital technologies and decarbonisation,\u201d says Carlos Arruda, president of Minas Gerais state research and development agency. \u201cPublic and private investments are growing, but it is still not sufficient.\u201d\n\nCarazza argues that the existing tech hub is \u201cnot something that makes a difference to the economy \u2014 we don\u2019t see a lot of people working there\u201d. he says: \u201cWe are not a very dynamic economy. We have problems creating jobs for people.\u201d Carazza adds that Belo Horizonte \u2014 particularly in its sprawling poorer suburbs \u2014 still suffers serious problems with sanitation infrastructure and transportation.\n\nIn many ways, its issues are common to many of Brazil\u2019s south-eastern and coastal cities, which have long lacked a robust engine for growth. BH\u2019s fortunes have not been helped by the fact that Minas Gerais has been bankrupt for the best part of a decade, following years of mismanagement and corruption scandals.\n\nEven so, many BH residents \u2014 particularly those who live within the 12km-long Contorno ring road that once marked the city\u2019s boundaries \u2014 say it has a better quality of life than S\u00e3o Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. It is cheaper and has, arguably, a more comfortable climate.\n\nRafaela Vitoria, chief economist at Banco Inter in BH, lived in S\u00e3o Paulo for 15 years before moving back to her hometown \u201cfor a better quality of life\u201d. She says: \u201cIt has been a great decision, one of the best I\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nBH is currently in the midst of a blossoming culinary renaissance, too, led by the likes of celebrity chef Leo Paix\u00e3o. In general, Minas Gerais people are particularly proud of their cuisine, with its indigenous, Portuguese and African influences. The state is known for its cheeses, which have risen rapidly in global estimation in recent years. And, then, there is the raucous BH bar scene. Few locals will miss the chance to remind you that the city has more watering holes per capita than any other in Brazil.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/792be2a4-2ad1-44f4-a582-9f9ffa4251b1"}}, {"id": "e970c8a5-9f6c-42cb-8498-7f372753f583", "event_name": "Minas plays focal role in effort to ease Brazil\u2019s fertiliser problem ", "blurb": "State drive is under way to address vulnerability of nation\u2019s agriculture to international events", "date": "2024-05-1500:00:00.0", "body": "On the eve of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Brazil\u2019s then-president, Jair Bolsonaro, travelled to Moscow on a special mission.\n\nEleventh-hour shuttle diplomacy it was not. Rather, the rightwing populist had an objective closer to home in his meeting with counterpart Vladimir Putin: to secure more fertilisers.\n\nAs a global shortage sent prices of farming inputs soaring, fears of a conflict in Europe disrupting trade flows further exposed Brazil\u2019s dependence on overseas suppliers for crop nutrients.\n\nA food commodities powerhouse, Brazil \u2014 a significant producer of soyabeans, sugarcane and corn \u2014 is the world\u2019s biggest importer of fertilisers. Inbound shipments cover 87 per cent of usage at an annual cost of $25bn, says the government. The highest volumes come from Russia, China and Canada.\n\nNow, to lessen the vulnerability of Brazilian agriculture to external shocks, a drive is under way to boost domestic fertiliser manufacturing. A focal point for investment is the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, home to a number of factories and new projects.\n\nEuroChem, a company of Russian origin headquartered in Switzerland, this year cut the ribbon on a $1bn complex in Minas that it says will represent 15 per cent of Brazil\u2019s output of phosphate fertilisers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to help improve the equation of food sovereignty,\u201d says Gustavo Horbach, the group\u2019s head for South America. \u201cBrazil will increasingly have a role as a bread basket for the world.\u201d\n\nLocated in Serra do Salitre, the EuroChem mine and processing facilities will have an annual production capacity of 1mn tonnes.\n\nAttendees at its inauguration in March included Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, five of his ministers and Minas state governor Romeu Zema.\n\nSimilar enterprises are found within 250km of EuroChem\u2019s site. Toronto-listed potash producer Verde Agritech opened a second factory in 2022. Swiss company Atlas Agro is designing an $850mn nitrogen fertiliser plant.\n\nOfficials argue that these industrial initiatives, in adding value to extracted raw materials, will help diversify the local economy.\u00a0Such developments are also represented as steps towards an ambitious federal target for Brazil to be at least 45 per cent self-sufficient in fertilisers by 2050.\n\nA little over a decade ago, Brazil met about 30 per cent of its own needs, according to the national fertiliser association. That proportion fell as domestic output shrank even as demand rose from the country\u2019s agribusiness boom. The result is more exposure to global price swings, exchange rates, shipping costs, port bottlenecks and geopolitical risks.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to increase national production, so as not to be at the mercy of international events,\u201d says Tom\u00e1s Pern\u00edas, analyst at commodities consultancy StoneX.\u00a0\u201cBut these projects take time to get off the ground and fertiliser consumption is increasing [so], in the short term, Brazil will still be very dependent on imports.\u201d\n\nThe advantage of Minas is its reserves of potash and phosphate rocks, respectively containing potassium and phosphorus, two of the three primary macronutrients for plants.\n\nMinas is Brazil\u2019s largest domestic source of fertilisers, producing nearly two-thirds of output. Major hubs are found in the Alto Parana\u00edba and Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro regions in the west, says Jo\u00e3o Paulo Braga, head of state agency Invest Minas. In addition to nutrient deposits, they have \u201clogistical benefits, due to proximity to large areas of agricultural production\u201d, he adds.\n\nEuroChem acquired its project in 2021. Outside Europe, it is the company\u2019s first vertically integrated site, combining mining, processing, production and distribution.\n\nDespite the relatively low ore content of rocks from the mine, Horbach says location is a positive factor. Most sales will be in Minas, where agribusiness accounts for more than a fifth of gross domestic product. \u201cBy entering production here in Brazil, we will be able to access the market in a more competitive way,\u201d he explains.\n\nNitrogen, the other main category of fertiliser, normally requires as its primary feedstock natural gas, which is not cheaply available in Brazil. However, Atlas Agro\u2019s installations will be powered by solar and wind energy, avoiding the need for the fossil fuel.\n\nBut, in spite of the large and growing national market for crop nutrients, success for fertilisers manufacturers in Brazil is far from guaranteed. Inadequate transport infrastructure, such as a lack of railways and poor road surfaces in remote areas, can make carrying bulky goods across land costly. Erratic weather and crop failures have recently hit fertiliser sales, too.\n\nVerde Agritech, which began operations at its potash mine and factory in 2017, has faced challenges of late. The company blamed low demand and a slump in potash prices for its financial results in 2023, when revenue at the group fell by half. Founder and chief executive Cristiano Veloso says higher interest rates have made it harder to extend credit to farmers for purchases.\n\nStill, Verde believes it can capture market share. Its potassium products are based on glauconite, a mineral free of chloride, which the company claims preserves microbes important for soil quality.\u00a0The opening of its second production facility two years ago gives it annual capacity of 3mn tonnes. It awaits environmental licensing to build a $50mn third unit. \u201cSuccess for our company will help make food supply chains more resilient,\u201d says Veloso.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/43abcfc0-d33a-483e-bf83-2282cdd17ca8"}}, {"id": "4142fd37-d795-4ae7-9d44-4222d556b0f2", "event_name": "As Minas goes, so goes Brazil", "blurb": "The bellwether state of Minas Gerais is a microcosm of the country\u2019s vast political, economic and social disparities", "date": "2024-05-1500:00:00.0", "body": "It was no coincidence that the two main rivals in Brazil\u2019s last presidential election, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Jair Bolsonaro, both began their campaigns in the huge southeastern state of Minas Gerais.\n\nNor was it just chance that, as the tightly fought and bitter race entered its final stretch in October 2022, both men returned to the landlocked state to host rallies and mop up as many extra votes as possible.\n\nHome to some 16mn voters \u2014 about one in 10 of the Brazilian electorate \u2014 and larger in size than mainland France, Minas Gerais is Brazil\u2019s bellwether state, a microcosm of the country\u2019s vast political, economic and social disparities.\n\nMoreover, since the restoration of direct presidential elections in 1989, no candidate has won the presidency without winning Minas (as the state is often simply called). As Minas goes, so goes the nation.\n\n\u201c[Minas] looks like a representative sample of Brazil,\u201d explains Felipe Nunes, chief executive of pollster Quaest, who is from the state.\n\nLula, the leftwing candidate, won the 2022 race with his haul of 50.2 per cent of the Minas vote almost matching his 50.9 per cent tally nationwide. Yet the importance of the state extends well beyond the cycle of presidential politics.\n\nMinas is Brazil\u2019s third-largest economy, after S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, as well as its largest producer of key commodities, such as coffee and iron ore. Its diverse geographical regions reflect and fuel the nation\u2019s wider economic fortunes.\n\nThe south of the state, like the south of the country, is more industrialised, while the western flank of Minas is riding the agricultural boom that is transforming the entire central-western region of Brazil.\n\nThe north of Minas, like the north and north-east of Brazil, remains poorer, with fewer economic opportunities and higher levels of government assistance, although burgeoning projects to mine lithium have been hailed a potential game-changer for the region.\n\nOften viewed as a smaller, more friendly version of S\u00e3o Paulo, state capital Belo Horizonte is home to a vibrant tech scene and the headquarters of such companies as electricity giant Cemig, housebuilder MRV Engenharia, and car rental group Localiza.\n\n\u201cWe are a synthesis of Brazil,\u201d says Bruno Carazza, a professor at the Dom Cabral Foundation in Belo Horizonte. \u201cWe are a mixture of everything.\u201d\n\nThe name Minas Gerais translates as General Mines \u2014 and mining has been a pillar of the mineiro economy since the first gold rush of the 17th century. This sparked such an influx of prospectors that the food supply collapsed and thousands died from famine. But the state\u2019s key tourist sites today \u2014 ornate colonial towns like Ouro Preto (meaning Black Gold) and Tiradentes \u2014 were built from the proceeds of the gold trade.\n\nMore recently, the mining industry has focus shifted to iron ore. Brazil is second only to Australia as an exporter of the commodity, much of it dug in Minas pits. After soyabeans and crude oil, it is Brazil\u2019s third-largest export.\n\nHowever, the industry has been badly shaken in the past decade by dam disasters at Minas mines. In 2015, 19 people died in the Mariana township after a waste dam run by Samarco \u2014 a joint venture between Brazil\u2019s Vale and Australia\u2019s BHP \u2014 collapsed. In 2019, 270 people died in the Brumadinho disaster, again involving a dangerous upstream tailings dam and on the watch of the Rio de Janeiro-headquartered Vale. The fallout from both disasters continues, with lawsuits winding their way through courts in Brazil and abroad.\n\nA key point of state pride is the outsized role Minas has played in Brazil\u2019s history. Several of the country\u2019s most consequential political leaders hailed from Minas, including Juscelino Kubitschek, who became president in 1956 and oversaw the construction in just 41 months of a new federal capital, Bras\u00edlia, deep in the arid interior. Minas was also home to Tancredo Neves who campaigned for democracy during Brazil\u2019s 21-year military dictatorship. When that ended in 1985, Neves was elected president of the republic, but died following intestinal surgery before he could take office.\n\nIf a single individual captures the imagination and the essence of the state, though, it is the man known simply as Tiradentes \u2014 who, in 1792, as a leading member of a Republican independence movement based in Minas, was executed by Portuguese colonial forces. When Brazil became a republic in the late 19th century, he was adopted as a national hero. Tiradentes Day on April 21 is a national holiday and the Minas state flag is a modified version of that used by his independence movement.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning, Minas has been very involved in Brazilian politics,\u201d says Carazza. \u201cThis idea of the republic is part of our history, the ideals are part of our culture.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0d0f1369-80d3-490f-91d5-afd5263d7614"}}, {"id": "7a4819f8-955d-4a0c-b8ef-aa15654247c2", "event_name": "Brazilian government ousts Petrobras chief after dispute over dividends", "blurb": "Jean Paul Prates is fifth CEO of state-controlled oil major to leave in 3 years", "date": "2024-05-1500:00:00.0", "body": "The head of Petrobras has been ousted following tensions with the leftwing Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva administration, which has sought to exert greater influence over Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil major.\n\nChief executive Jean Paul Prates planned to offer his resignation to the board, Petrobras said on Tuesday evening, ending weeks of uncertainty over his future at the $108bn group.\n\nThe decision to remove the top manager of Latin America\u2019s biggest crude producer was taken by the government in Bras\u00edlia, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nFriction had been mounting since Prates disagreed with government-appointed board members this year over whether Petrobras should pay an extraordinary dividend to shareholders.\n\nSince returning to the presidency last year, Lula has pushed Petrobras to reduce investor payouts and instead invest more in areas such as renewable energy and refineries, aiming to stimulate economic activity.\n\nThe government has been accused of political interference by critics who fear a repeat of the mismanagement and scandal at Petrobras that occurred under past leftwing rule.\n\nThe company\u2019s American depositary receipts were down 6 per cent in after-hours trading in New York following the news of Prates\u2019 impending departure.\n\nPetrobras said the energy and mines ministry had picked Magda Chambriard, a former head of the Brazilian oil and gas regulator, to replace Prates. Her nomination must be approved by the board.\n\nFormerly a senator from Lula\u2019s party, 55 year-old Prates had prior energy sector experience and began the role in January 2023 after being handpicked by the leftist leader. His exit is the fifth departure of a Petrobras chief in three years.\n\nThe Rio de Janeiro-based company is the world\u2019s seventh-largest oil producer by output, according to consultancy Rystad Energy.\n\nAs he struggled to square the demands of external investors with the Brazilian state, Prates also clashed with energy minister Alexandre Silveira, who criticised Petrobras for not reducing fuel prices enough.\n\nLeftwing politicians accused the chief executive of being too closely aligned with private sector shareholders.\n\nUnder previous rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro, the company sought to focus on offshore oil and gas production, selling off assets considered non-core.

Crude oil is Brazil\u2019s second largest export in dollar terms.\n\nThe Brazilian Institute for Oil and Gas, an industry lobby group, estimates the federal government has lost out on BRL$1bn ($200mn) in tax receipts as a result of the strike. Revenue across the sector was down by BRL$3.4bn due to the contraction of economic activity, it claimed.Dozens of electricity generation projects, including four thermoelectric power stations and three windpower parks, have also been halted pending approval from the agencies, according to Ascema.\n\n\u201cWith environmental agencies running slowly, financial, political, ecological and social losses are inevitable,\u201d said Cleberson Zavaski, president of the union.\n\nPresident Lula, a former trade unionist, has publicly supported the workers\u2019 right to strike, but his government has to date been unable to reach an agreement with labour leaders.\n\nThe industrial action also threatens to tarnish Lula\u2019s efforts to be seen as a green champion, and international standing as host of the UN COP30 climate summit next year.\n\nDeforestation in the Amazon has fallen under Lula, following a sharp rise during the administration of his predecessor, and remained low at the early stage of the strike action. For the first two months of the year it was down by 63 per cent compared with the same period last year.\n\nBut the absence of field agents engaged in command and control activities through the agencies \u2014 which include Ibama, ICMBio, which manages national protected areas, and the Brazilian Forest Service, which watches forests\u2019 concessions \u2014 could result in the destruction of Brazil\u2019s biomes beginning to increase again, environmentalists warned.\n\n\u201cBrazil\u2019s success in containing deforestation in 2023 was thanks to the increased commitment of these key environmental agencies and their current dysfunction will undoubtedly allow forest destruction and land invasions to increase,\u201d said Christian Poirier, Amazon Watch programme director.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9d244da1-9883-4aab-b95a-8ecf3ffd5b4f"}}, {"id": "41403530-7528-43d6-965e-c896fdbb8369", "event_name": "Record Brazil floods kill 95 and cause $1bn damage", "blurb": "Extreme rainfall displaces 200,000 as scientists link disaster with climate change", "date": "2024-05-0800:00:00.0", "body": "Rescuers were on Wednesday scrambling to reach people cut off by record-breaking floods in southern Brazil that have killed at least 95 people and displaced more than 200,000, as more rainfall was set to further hamper aid efforts.\n\nFirefighters, civil defence units and the army struggled to reach those marooned by water in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, some of whom have spent days stuck on the roofs of buildings.\n\nThe historic floods followed a deluge of rainfall in recent days, which some scientists have linked with climate change. One monitoring station in Porto Alegre, the state capital, recorded almost 260mm in three days \u2014 equivalent to about two months\u2019 average rainfall.\n\nBrazil\u2019s air force has deployed Israeli-designed Hermes 900 reconnaissance drones, equipped with high definition cameras and sensors, which operate alongside helicopter teams to locate and rescue victims.\n\nVolunteers have joined the effort, including people trying to use surfboards and jet-skis to reach people in need of help.\n\nPorto Alegre, which is home to 1.3mn people, has been one of the places worst affected after the Gua\u00edba river broke its banks and flooded the city. The high point of the river reached 5.3 metres, far above a previous record of 4.76 metres in 1941.\n\nEconomic damage is so far estimated at about $1bn, according to the National Confederation of Municipalities.\n\nState governor Eduardo Leite has called for an aid programme resembling the Marshall Plan that followed the second world war to fix the damage, which he said would only truly become visible once the flood waters receded.\n\nOn Tuesday he warned of further bad weather, with a mass of cold air expected to bring more heavy rain and cause temperatures to drop sharply.\n\n\u201cIt is already the worst climate disaster in our state, and we need to avoid loss of life at this time,\u201d he said last week.\n\nIn the past week, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has twice visited the state \u2014 which is home to 11mn people \u2014 promising federal aid to rebuild roads and bridges.\n\nRio Grande do Sul is Brazil\u2019s fifth-largest state economy and is a key producer of agricultural products, as well as a centre for industry.\n\nThe state accounts for 70 per cent of national rice production, with 10 per cent expected to be lost because of the floods. Thirty per cent of the state\u2019s 21mn-tonne soyabean harvest is also expected to perish. Lula has said that Brazil will import rice and beans from abroad to prevent food shortages.\n\nThe disaster is the fourth such event to roil the state in the past year, following severe floods in July, September and November, which killed dozens.\n\nStark images from the disaster zone have galvanised a donations campaign across Brazil and abroad. On Tuesday, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the company would support relief efforts.\n\nPedro Luiz Cort\u00eas, professor of environmental science at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, said the disaster was linked with climate change.\n\nA high pressure zone in the centre of Brazil was caused by abnormal warming in the Atlantic Ocean, he said. This was blocking cold fronts in the country\u2019s south and diverting maritime humidity southwards.\n\n\u201cRio Grande do Sul is affected by three events that are fuelling the rains: the cold fronts, the humidity coming from the Atlantic and the high pressure dome,\u201d he said. \u201cThese rains were caused by this meteorological phenomenon that is caused by climate change, because this warming of the Atlantic is not normal for this time of year.\u201d\n\nThe state and federal governments were ill-prepared for such climate emergencies, he added.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/dec816f8-1f53-4c47-939c-874efb8218c6"}}, {"id": "da68572c-d2db-4d7a-a396-1985f615be15", "event_name": "Embraer explores options for aircraft to rival Airbus and Boeing", "blurb": "Brazilian aerospace group studies plans for narrow-body passenger plane or long-range business jet", "date": "2024-05-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Embraer, the Brazilian aerospace and defence group, is studying options for a new passenger aircraft that could put it in direct competition with the industry\u2019s heavyweights, Airbus and Boeing.\n\nThe project, which is in its early stages, could either become plans for a narrow-body aircraft or a long-range business jet, people familiar with the situation confirmed.\n\nThe business case for the initiative should be ready by the end of next year, when it will then be taken to the board of directors, these people said. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Embraer was looking at the possibility of a narrow-body aircraft.\n\nThe world\u2019s third-largest civil aircraft manufacturer is the leading producer of regional jets, which typically have up to 120 seats and are smaller than the narrow-body planes that Boeing and Airbus make. Its latest and largest model, the E195-E2, can carry up to 146 passengers.\n\nIn executive jets, Embraer sells entry-level, light, midsized and super midsized aircraft. The long-range segment is dominated by Gulfstream, Bombardier and Dassault Aviation.\n\nAny decision to enter the single-aisle market would see Embraer compete directly with Airbus\u2019s best-selling A320 family of jets and Boeing\u2019s 737 Max aircraft. It would be a decision fraught with risk; launching a model costs tens of billions of dollars and success is not guaranteed.\n\nEmbraer has in the past regularly played down any interest in entering the competitive market for single-aisle aircraft.\u00a0Attention over the possibility has intensified, however, amid the turmoil at Boeing after the mid-air blowout of a section of one of its 737 Max aircraft in January.\n\nThe US plane maker has since been forced to slow production of the Max as it focuses on improving its manufacturing and quality processes. It burnt through almost $4bn in cash in the first three months of this year and is revamping its top management. The crisis has frustrated Boeing\u2019s airline customers, many of which have had to trim their busy summer flying schedules.\n\nEmbraer said that while it \u201ccertainly has the capability to develop a new narrow-body aircraft\u201d, the company has a \u201cyoung and very successful portfolio of products developed in recent years, and we are really focused on selling those products\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any plan for a sizeable cycle of capex at this time.\u201d\n\nEmbraer, which has previously said it was interested in partnerships to open new markets for its current products, is separately talking to several countries. It will consider local production, depending on the volumes of aircraft acquired.\n\nThe company has emerged strongly from the Covid-19 pandemic, returning to a profit of $164mn in 2023 as it ramped up deliveries of new aircraft. Its order backlog is at the highest level in seven years, according to Citi analysts.\n\nShares in the S\u00e3o Paulo-listed group have risen by more than half in 2024, giving Embraer a market capitalisation of $4.8bn on Wednesday.\n\nTaking on Boeing head-on would be a remarkable turn of events for Embraer, which is considered the crown jewel of Brazilian engineering.\n\nIt is waiting for a decision from an arbitration it filed at the International Chamber of Commerce after Boeing abandoned a deal to take a majority stake in its civil aerospace division in 2020.\n\nIndustry analysts, however, believe that Embraer will be cautious about taking on the two giants of aviation.\n\nBombardier, Canada\u2019s former industrial champion, was almost bankrupted attempting to do just that with its C series, a small, single-aisle offering. Bombardier ended up partnering with Airbus on the model in 2017 before selling out to the European giant and quitting the commercial sector in 2020 to focus on private jets.\n\nEmbraer also operates a defence division that supplies military equipment, such as light attack planes and transport aircraft.\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/dbcac8f2-ede8-46ff-982f-a30a144300ee"}}, {"id": "ee6d71c4-3f3f-441e-8bd3-c104e55529c6", "event_name": "BHP told to hand over executives\u2019 employment details in Brazil dam disaster litigation", "blurb": "Claimants hope to bolster their case that managers were incentivised to push for cost cuts that contributed to the tragedy", "date": "2024-04-1800:00:00.0", "body": "Mining group BHP has been ordered to hand over historic employment details for staff including its chief executive Mike Henry as part of a legal battle over one of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disasters.\n\nThe High Court in London on Thursday told the company to disclose \u201ckey performance indicators\u201d and evaluations for several executives, among other documents, following a disclosure application on behalf of some 700,000 claimants affected by the collapse of a dam in 2015 that killed 19 people and caused widespread environmental damage.\n\nLawyers acting for the Brazilian claimants, which include municipalities and indigenous communities as well as individuals, hope the documents will bolster their case that BHP managers were incentivised to push for cost cuts that contributed to the disaster.

As finance ministers gathered in Foggy Bottom, a long-simmering theme resurfaced: who will pay for the economic and physical damage brought by climate change?\n\n\u201cDealing with the climate emergency\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009requires a volume of resources that cannot be fully mobilised domestically in emerging market and developing economies,\u201d Fernando Haddad, Brazil\u2019s finance minister, said on Tuesday. What was needed, Haddad said, was \u201ca concerted international effort to effectively mitigate climate change\u201d. Brazil is hosting the next G20 meeting in November.\n\nThe global problem of climate change is especially pronounced in low-income countries, according to an IMF report released earlier this month.\n\nThe report identified 69 low-income countries where governments need to reduce high debt levels to \u201callocate part of their revenues to critical climate change adaptation investments\u201d. They include Haiti, Moldova and Kenya, to name a few.\n\nThese countries had been stung by elevated food inflation stemming in part from \u201cthe ongoing El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, and the likely incidence of other negative climate events\u201d, the report said.\n\nAs debates about climate change costs take hold during this week\u2019s meetings, they are already affecting countries\u2019 credit ratings.\n\n\u201cRising physical climate risks will cause mounting economic and financial losses for governments,\u201d Atsi Sheth, chief credit officer for Moody\u2019s Ratings, told me. \u201cThe climate finance gap, particularly in emerging markets, will remain an obstacle, even as efforts to mobilise private finance could start to bear fruit.\u201d\n\nS&P Global warned in November of a \u201cpoverty trap\u201d in low-income countries hit by climate change. Countries might be unable to rebuild infrastructure after being hit by extreme weather, therefore exacerbating development challenges in the places \u201cleast ready to cope\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe increasing frequency \u2014 as well as severity \u2014 of physical climate-related risks could result in environmental factors becoming more certain and material\u201d when examining a country\u2019s credit rating, Prerna Divecha, head of market development for climate credit risk at S&P, told me yesterday.\n\n\u201cGiven the vulnerability of the population and socio-economic impact on health, food, infrastructure and sanitation, climate stresses may be more pronounced for a developing country in comparison to a developed country.\u201d\n\nMore news on the cost of climate change is on the agenda for this week. We will keep you posted in Friday\u2019s newsletter.\n\nThe Texas Permanent School Fund earlier this year announced it would withdraw $8.5bn from BlackRock\u2019s management because of concerns about the asset manager\u2019s environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing.\n\nNow, the $54bn fund, which invests to generate funds for Texas schools, has taken a step further. On Monday, it announced it had adopted an \u201cESG sceptical\u201d shareholder voting policy. This will entail assessing shareholder proposals at companies\u2019 annual meetings and voting against \u201cattempts to pressure companies to diminish the use of fossil fuels\u201d or proposals that oppose gun rights, among other things.\n\n\u201cESG efforts have targeted Texas\u2019 oil and gas economy,\u201d said Aaron Kinsey, chair of the state board of education. \u201cWe are making sure our votes are not cast in a way that is incompatible with our fiduciary duty to Texas.\u201d\n\nThe fund said it casted between 40,000 and 50,000 votes at annual meetings each year.\n\nThe Texas fund appears to be the first body of its kind to adopt an official ESG-sceptical screen. Other Republican states might be looking at changing their voting behaviour now that Texas has announced this move.\n\n\u201cThe motivation here is not to impose conservative ideology on companies, but rather to depoliticise the world of proxy voting,\u201d Jerry Bowyer, founder and president of Bowyer Research, who is running the ESG-scepticism voting screen for the Texas fund, told me.\n\n\u201cThese [voting] guidelines aim at getting hot-button culture war advocacy out of corporate governance and getting companies back to neutral on those issues,\u201d Bowyer said. \u201cOpining on contentious social issues does not promote shareholder value.\u201d\n\nLast week we published an email from Paul OBrien in Wyoming, who argued that critics of fossil fuel financiers should focus more on governments\u2019 failure to act.

Our effort is to bring order to it,\u201d he told GloboNews TV on Monday.\n\nBudget holes have been an Achilles heel for the South American nation before, with knock-on effects on public borrowing, inflation and interest rates.\n\nMany analysts had already warned that the current deficit targets were unrealistic and likely to be tweaked. They were introduced as part of a new set of fiscal rules designed to boost public spending under veteran politician Lula, who began his third non-consecutive term last year.\n\nLuiz Maciel, chief economist of Brazil macro at Bahia Asset Management in Rio de Janeiro, said the proposed amendments nevertheless sent a \u201cnegative message\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is yet another demonstration that this is not a government willing to guarantee the [stabilisation] of public debt. There is a consensus in the market that the government is wasteful,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Brazilian real slipped to its lowest level against the US dollar in more than a year on Tuesday, trading at 5.27 against the greenback.\n\nInvestors have expressed growing concerns about Brazil\u2019s economic approach under Lula, who was credited with anti-poverty programmes during his previous terms between 2003 and 2011.\n\nSome see warning signs that there could be a repeat of mistakes that marred the previous period of rule by his Workers\u2019 party, or PT, which ended in a fiscal crisis contributing to the country\u2019s worst recession on record.\n\nS\u00e9rgio Vale, chief economist at MB Associados, criticised a \u201cpoorly designed\u201d fiscal policy reliant on increasing receipts \u2014 mainly through taxes, often subject to factors such as growth that were outside the government\u2019s control \u2014 rather than cutting costs.\n\nThe framework launched a year ago stipulates that public spending must increase every year above inflation, in a band between 0.6 and 2.5 per cent. Overall budget expansion is limited to 70 per cent of revenue increases.\n\nThis replaced a previous, tougher rule that restricted annual expenditure growth to the rate of inflation. That was deemed fundamental to stability by investors but ended up politically unpopular.\n\n\u201cThe government will have to do something far more drastic to deliver a zero deficit. But it has low popularity and wants to invest and spend more,\u201d said Vale. \u201cThe consequence of this poorly calibrated fiscal [arrangement] is to worsen long-term interest rates, which makes investments more inexpensive and harms growth.\u201d\n\nIn his bid to raise living standards following a decade of stagnation, Lula has increased welfare payments and the minimum wage, while unveiling a major public works programme.\n\nHis critics say this will force up public borrowing, which was already relatively high for a developing economy at 75.5 per cent of GDP in February.\n\nSceptics of the loose fiscal stance also fear it could stir inflation and impede the central bank\u2019s ability to keep cutting interest rates. Lula has attacked the institution\u2019s monetary policy as a drag on growth.\n\nThe bank\u2019s governor, Roberto Campos Neto, said on Monday that \u201cthe ideal is not to change the [fiscal] targets\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhenever you have a change in the government, that makes the fiscal anchor less transparent or less believable\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009So the cost of monetary policy becomes higher,\u201d he told an event in the US.\n\nThe opposition decried the move as evidence of fiscal irresponsibility, but analysts argue the changes will pass the conservative-dominated congress thanks to the greater funds they will probably make available for lawmakers.\n\nGil Castello Branco of Contas Abertas, an NGO that scrutinises the public accounts, linked the looser rules with municipal elections due in October. \u201cIn an election year, there won\u2019t be any resistance to changes to relax the rules and increase spending,\u201d he said.\n\nSome investors remain optimistic. Despite Brazil recording its second-largest-ever deficit in 2023, at 2.1 per cent of GDP, this year\u2019s goal of eliminating the shortfall remains intact, helped by one-off windfall receipts. The targets have a tolerance of 0.25 per cent on either side.\n\nJared Lou, portfolio manager at William Blair, said Brazilian local assets were still attractive. \u201cLula we view as a pragmatic leftist leader. He will continue to try and strike a balance in maintaining macro[economic] stability and his social goals.\u201d\n\nFelipe Camargo, senior emerging market economist at Oxford Economics, said that after he impressed financial markets in 2023, Haddad\u2019s reputation was likely to take a hit. \u201cThe fact that he couldn\u2019t win the battle to keep the fiscal targets for the upcoming years weakens his credibility,\u201d Camargo said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Isabela Fleischmann", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/14e6a4d4-8be7-46cf-bb51-8445b0e85dc1"}}, {"id": "ffca8f28-b9b3-4315-b907-49c6e4304d11", "event_name": "Venice Biennale curator Adriano Pedrosa: \u2018Always have your concept ready because you don\u2019t have much time\u2019", "blurb": "\u2018Foreigners Everywhere\u2019 aims to refresh art history by highlighting artists who tell stories about global movement", "date": "2024-04-1300:00:00.0", "body": "Adriano Pedrosa had already decided on Foreigners Everywhere as the title of his Venice Biennale exhibition even before he was appointed curator of the 60th edition. In 2011, having recently directed the Istanbul Biennale, the Brazilian art historian travelled to Italy to see the rival show. \u201cI walked through the streets, through the Biennale\u2019s galleries, and as a curatorial exercise I began thinking about what I would do if I was ever invited,\u201d he says, speaking over video from the apartment in Venice he\u2019s been staying in as he prepares to open the show on April 20.\n\n\u201cThe title of the Venice Biennale is often very open-ended, poetic, something that could encompass anything and everything, and I thought it would be interesting to do something very palpable and concrete. My recommendation for any curator is always have your Venice Biennale concept ready, because when they invite you, you don\u2019t have much time. I think that lack of time is why people choose these vague themes that don\u2019t seem to mean so much. I\u2019ve been thinking about this exhibition for a decade.\u201d\n\nRemarkably, given that Venice is the world\u2019s most important contemporary art exhibition, more than half of the 331 artists chosen by Pedrosa are dead. The curator says that he wanted to give visibility to artists from the past who didn\u2019t have the opportunities today\u2019s generation do. \u201cIt is easier today for a younger artist from the Global South to get attention than it has ever been before,\u201d he says. This is both due to the strengthening of art infrastructure at home and a greater interest abroad. \u201cIn the last decade or so it has become unthinkable that you might do a Eurocentric biennale of contemporary art.\u201d While western museums have made efforts to diversify their collections and exhibitions, Pedrosa says that there are still many names who haven\u2019t had their rightful international recognition. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the same rules applied to historical shows, so I wanted to look at Modernism in South America, Africa, Asia, and how Modernism travelled in the 20th century.\u201d\n\nThis migration will be examined in a section Pedrosa has titled Nucleo Storico (Historical Core), which features abstract ink painter Nena Saguil (born in the Philippines, died in France), social realist Emma Reyes (born in Colombia, who also migrated to France) and painter and poet Malangatana Valente Ngwenya (born in Mozambique, died in Portugal). \u201cMany of these artists are canonical or famous in their own country but virtually unknown internationally,\u201d Pedrosa says. Elsewhere in his galleries, he examines the influence of the Italian diaspora travelling in the opposite direction, not least to S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nPedrosa is the first Latin American person to take the helm of the Biennale and only the second curator from the \u201cGlobal South\u201d. His appointment in part recognises his innovation at the Museu de Arte de S\u00e3o Paulo, which he has directed since 2014. He arrived with a formula which shook up the concrete and glass institution on Avenue Paulista. Each year he has staged a large group show with the title Histories and a corresponding theme, which all the other solo exhibitions and events across the year riff on. These have ranged from Afro-Atlantic histories in 2018 to a range of subjects that seemed a pointed rebuke of the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s far-right populism, for example feminist histories in 2019 and state-of-the-nation histories in 2022. Next year\u2019s programme is titled Ecological Histories.\n\nIn Portuguese, \u201chistorias\u201d encompasses both fictional and factual narratives and Pedrosa\u2019s exhibitions eschewed canonical art history to encompass outsider art, Indigenous practices, religious artefacts and ceremonial objects, as well as historical objects. Is this an attempt at decolonisation? Pedrosa says that while that is part of his agenda, he wants the programme to feel \u201cpolyphonic\u201d, rejecting any notion of fixed narrative.\n\n\u201cVenice shares the speculative approach that we have within the Historias programme. We are not telling the ultimate history, the final word in whatever we are exploring, but a draft history, one possible story.\u201d Occasionally the Histories have proven too sprawling and Pedrosa\u2019s open approach has risked a loss of focus, but they never fail to be ambitious projects that, while inviting a wide audience, never treat the museum visitors as fools.\n\nWith the theme of immigration in Venice, many viewers will undoubtedly read this Biennale in the context of current crises, whether Ukraine, Palestine or elsewhere. For a second time Russia will not be sending an artist to fill its national pavilion along the main drag of the Giardini, but Ukraine will exhibit at a venue outside the gardens. In March more than 9,000 signatories, including artists who have shown previously at the biennale, signed a petition calling for Israel to be barred from the event. (Despite this, the Israeli pavilion is going ahead, with artist Ruth Patir and curators Mira Lapidot and Tamar Margalit.)\n\nThe curator is quick to say he has no say on the national pavilions but that he welcomes people seeing the stories of those who have previously fled violence in parallel with today\u2019s conflicts. \u201cYou can\u2019t avoid your show being read through the current moment. I embrace that. It\u2019s not something I address directly in the exhibition, but there are works here and there which reflect on the ongoing conflict.\u201d\n\nWhile months of planning have gone into the exhibition, with research trips to a bewildering array of art scenes (Pedrosa says Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Angola, Kenya and Zimbabwe were new destinations for him), he hopes the show will surprise him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think about my exhibition, because I haven\u2019t seen it yet. I really believe in learning about art by looking at it, looking at it in the flesh, and seeing how one object sits next to another object. That\u2019s the real story.\u201d\n\nApril 20-November 24, labiennale.org", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d41b0a7d-2cf8-4175-96da-cbd1047e8c05"}}, {"id": "ec84eedd-ea4e-496c-850d-ee749c11de6d", "event_name": "Era of bribes is over, say commodities trading chiefs", "blurb": "CEOs of Trafigura, Vitol and Gunvor say they have learned lessons from the 2010s scandals", "date": "2024-04-0900:00:00.0", "body": "The days of handing out bribes to secure commodity contracts are over, the heads of the world\u2019s biggest trading companies said, after a series of US bribery scandals put the sector under intense scrutiny.\n\nSpeaking at the FT Commodities Global Summit in Lausanne the heads of Vitol, Trafigura and Gunvor each said they had overhauled trading and compliance processes since the 2010s and that bribery and corruption has no place in commodity trading today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried very hard over the past few years to re-engineer some of those processes and policies,\u201d said Russell Hardy, chief executive officer of Vitol, the world\u2019s largest independent oil trader.\n\nThe firm, which agreed to pay more than $160mn to authorities in the US and Brazil in 2020 in relation to bribery charges in Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico, has sought to \u201cinfluence the culture\u201d of its employees to \u201cembrace that compliance is a necessary part of their thinking and everything that they do\u201d, he said.\n\nRotterdam-based Vitol, whose chief executive sits in London, has had \u201cconversations with a lot of [its] stakeholders to impress upon them the efforts that we\u2019re putting in\u201d, he added.\n\nLarge scale trading of goods like oil and critical minerals has in the past relied on well-connected intermediaries to win business leading to corrupt deals that have drawn the scrutiny of US and European prosecutors in recent years.\n\nA former Vitol trader was convicted in February in the US on corruption charges relating to more than $1mn in bribes he paid to officials in Ecuador and Mexico between 2015 and 2020.\n\nRival Trafigura in March pleaded guilty to charges by US prosecutors of bribery in Brazil between 2003 and 2014, agreeing to pay more than $120mn in fines and forfeited profits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m modest enough to say, you can never say never\u201d said Jeremy Weir, Trafigura CEO, when asked whether similar corrupt dealings could happen again at the company. \u201cWhat you need to do is put in all those checks and balances, and training and programs in place to ensure that you can address these specific problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I do feel in our case, we\u2019re doing the best we possibly can.\u201d\n\nWeir said the company had \u201cevolved\u201d its compliance program, and long stopped the use of intermediaries. \u201cThere\u2019s some businesses we might not do.

It is very clear that Enel is unable to continue,\u201d said Ricardo Nunes, the centre-right mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, adding that he had been told by experts that the city\u2019s grid was at risk of \u201ccollapse\u201d within three years without significant investment.\n\nLast year leftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva made infrastructure a key area for spending, unveiling a four-year $76bn public works programme.\n\nBut projections from consultancy Inter B suggest that infrastructure investment this year will still account for less than 2 per cent of gross domestic product, down from just under 2.5 per cent a decade ago under previous leftwing administrations, and far from enough to meet the country\u2019s needs.\n\nMoreover, the lion\u2019s share of this investment is being driven by the private sector. In the electrical power sector alone, more than 90 per cent of expenditure is projected to come from private companies, according to Inter B.\n\nAlessandra Ribeiro, a partner at consultants Tendencias, said infrastructure investment totalling 1.8 per cent of GDP was \u201cwell below what is needed\u201d in Brazil.\n\nNunes\u2019s criticisms of Enel were echoed by Alexandre Silveira, Brazil\u2019s energy minister, who has asked regulators to start a disciplinary process that could result in company losing its operating concession. Under the terms of the current concession, which is due to run until 2028, Enel is responsible for investing in and maintaining the grid.\n\nThe furore was sparked by a blackout late last month that lasted about three days and predominantly affected the city\u2019s poorer central region. Businesses, hospitals and schools were forced to shut, causing widespread public discontent.\n\nIt followed another days-long outage in November, which was initially caused by a storm. Experts estimated that the outage drove a 6.5 per cent fall in retail revenues compared with the same period the previous year.\n\nEnel said it was in \u201cfull compliance with all contractual and regulatory obligations\u201d and that the \u201cthreat of revocation of the concession could raise concerns among foreign investors [in Brazil and] harm relations between Brazil and Italy\u201d. Rome has a stake of about 24 per cent in the utility.\n\nWith Brazil hosting the COP30 climate conference next year, \u201cit would not be in the country\u2019s interest to jeopardise the good relations it has always had with Enel\u201d, it added. The company is one of the world\u2019s largest private renewables operators.\n\nClaudio Frischtak, president of Inter B, said responsibility for the blackouts was partly on Enel, which despite meeting its obligations under the concession had been slow to repair the infrastructure during outages.\n\nBut he also said that the government should shoulder the blame for not closely auditing the company and for not providing new proposals to improve the power sector\u2019s resilience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a multiple failure. The situation we\u2019re experiencing in the country doesn\u2019t have a single cause,\u201d he said, adding that extreme weather linked to climate change would make blackouts increasingly likely and the only long-term solution is a programme to lay cables underground.\n\nThe city\u2019s power problems will probably feature heavily in campaigning for municipal elections in October.\n\nClaudio Sales, president of the Acende Brasil Institute, said Nunes and the city government were looking for \u201cthings that can motivate the population\u201d to back their re-election bid, while opposition politicians are using the crisis as a platform to burnish their credentials.\n\nBut he added that \u201cEnel has almost doubled investments\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. to about R$1.5bn [$300mn] a year, compared with R$800mn invested by the previous concession holder.

On March 31 1964, a military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat began which would overthrow leftist president Jo\u00e3o Goulart. It spawned a repressive dictatorship lasting 21 years, considered by many Brazilians to be the darkest chapter of the country\u2019s modern history.\n\nYet the date has passed without official remembrance events, reportedly on the orders of the current leftwing leader, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. The reason, it seems, is to avoid tensions with the nation\u2019s armed forces, which have come under an uncomfortable spotlight lately.\n\nPolice investigators believe that senior military figures were involved in hatching a plot to overturn Lula\u2019s election victory in late 2022, with the goal of keeping in power his defeated far-right rival, Jair Bolsonaro. Although the plan was not executed, the revelations suggest a democratic rupture was close. Bolsonaro denies any wrongdoing.\n\nDespite the present-day parallels, Lula has downplayed the anniversary of the 1964 putsch. \u201cI\u2019m not going to dwell on it, I\u2019m going to move this country forward,\u201d he said in February.\u00a0The leader\u2019s stance has dismayed some allies on the left, who wanted the government to honour the victims of a regime that restricted freedoms and tortured, imprisoned and killed opponents. As a trade unionist, Lula was jailed for leading strikes during the period.\n\nSince returning to office for a third term, the president has sought to improve relations with the armed forces, who were a pillar of support for Bolsonaro, a former army captain and admirer of the dictatorship. At a delicate moment for the military, the aim is not to cause them any further embarrassment, one government official tells me.\n\nBut some critics fear the state\u2019s lack of commemoration emboldens revisionist narratives. They draw a direct link between such apologism and January 8 2023 when, days after Lula\u2019s inauguration, radical Bolsonaro supporters ransacked the Congress, Supreme Court and presidential palace. Claiming without evidence that the election was rigged, the rioters urged military intervention.\n\nDefenders of the 1964 coup, which enjoyed backing from the media, middle class and business elites, call it a \u201crevolution\u201d that saved the country from communism. \u201cThe truth is that the military government brought Brazil to full development,\u201d read one circular on a Bolsonarista WhatsApp group. \u201cThe great failure was allowing the agitators of the past to recover their political rights.\u201d\n\nWhile the official toll of 434 killed and disappeared is much lower than under juntas in Argentina or Chile, human rights campaigners reject the idea that Brazil\u2019s was a \u201clight\u201d dictatorship. An estimated 20,000 people were tortured.\n\nAt a memorial gathering in S\u00e3o Paulo, one of many events held by activists, criticism of Lula is tempered by a recognition that his narrow election victory \u2014 with just 51 per cent of votes \u2014 means he must govern pragmatically.\n\nHolding a sign that reads \u201cRemember in order not to forget\u201d, 84-year-old Lucia Fabrini, who had friends that were tortured, imprisoned and killed during the dictatorship, says of the government\u2019s attitude: \u201cThere are things behind the scenes that we don\u2019t know about.\u201d She adds that it was \u201cfrustrating and disappointing nevertheless. The pain remains\u201d.\n\nBut historical comparisons only go so far. While the exact workings of the putative 2022 plot are still not fully clear, it seems to have stalled precisely because of a lack of support among top generals. In statements to investigators, the former army and air force commanders said they warned Bolsonaro against such a path. And the US, which approved of the 1964 coup, pushed through public and private channels for the electoral process to be respected.\n\nUltimately, the handover of power to Lula last year demonstrated the Brazilian armed forces\u2019 commitment, as an institution at least, to the democratic order. But when fundamental disagreements over facts from almost a lifetime ago persist, it is hard to see how today\u2019s political polarisation in Brazilian society can be overcome.\n\nmichael.pooler@ft.com", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/07f09e9e-cdc9-4264-b90f-d7fbbf69d85a"}}, {"id": "c25b4aae-8f6a-45eb-bfa7-7910c4fc9322", "event_name": "Soaring coffee prices will squeeze Asia\u2019s caf\u00e9 culture", "blurb": "Extreme temperatures and droughts in big bean-producing countries have led to lower harvests", "date": "2024-04-0100:00:00.0", "body": "First chocolate, now coffee \u2014 the supply of modern life\u2019s necessities is being squeezed by a changing climate. Extreme temperatures and droughts in south-east Asia, home to the world\u2019s second- and third-largest producers of coffee beans, have led to lower harvests. Falling bean supply has implications not just for our daily lives but also for company earnings.\n\nA heatwave in Vietnam, the world\u2019s second-largest bean producer, could reduce output by as much as a fifth in the year to September compared with a forecast from the US Department of Agriculture. Exports from Indonesia, the third-largest producer, are also expected to drop for similar reasons, which would mark a second consecutive year of decline.\n\nAs a results, global coffee bean futures are near record highs. Prices of London robusta coffee futures, the global benchmark, are up by more than 50 per cent in the past year to about $3,500 a tonne.\n\nDo not expect a quick return to normal. Following last year\u2019s record low harvest in Asia, some farmers have switched from coffee to crops such as rubber, which are easier to produce in warmer, humid weather.\n\nThe timing is especially bad for coffee-related businesses. Consumption in south-east Asian countries has been soaring, with demand in Indonesia alone doubling over the past decade.\n\nIn China consumption is up more than 130 per cent, as revealed by the exponential growth of coffee chains there. The country now leads the world with the most coffee chain stores, ahead of the US. Luckin Coffee, China\u2019s answer to Starbucks, has more than 16,000 stores earning sales of $3.5bn last year.\n\nOutput from Brazil, the largest arabica bean producer, is in high demand, with exports to China up 160 per cent in the first two months of this year. Exports to Japan have also nearly doubled. A tight market and few alternatives mean a shortage from south-east Asian producers will quickly squeeze the margins of beverage and coffee-related businesses.\n\nThis retail sector has already been an underperformer in Asia. In Japan, for example, shares of food group Ajinomoto, parent of Ajinomoto AGF, which makes instant coffee products, and Ito En, the Japanese drinks company that operates speciality coffee shops in Japan, have significantly lagged the broader benchmark Nikkei 225 over the past year.\n\nThis is bad news for coffee fans across the region. These companies have little choice but to pass costs on to consumers.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c719e755-76f6-41ea-af8b-81256591e26e"}}, {"id": "8a5cd9d6-a667-4a87-9f14-ac00c703ffd9", "event_name": "EU takes on fake news ahead of elections ", "blurb": "Officials are worried about an 'avalanche of disinformation' from Russia", "date": "2024-04-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Online fake news and hybrid campaigns increase ahead of European elections, investors are concerned about President Lula\u2019s interventions in the economy, and China\u2019s factory activity has expanded for the first time in six months.\n\nMentioned in this podcast:\n\nEurope battles \u2018avalanche of disinformation\u2019 from Russia\n\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva steps up interventions in Brazil\u2019s largest companies\n\nChina\u2019s factory activity adds to signs of recovery\n\nThe FT News Briefing is produced by Fiona Symon, Sonja Hutson, Kasia Broussalian and Marc Filippino.

Company executives were paid bribes for handing out contracts in a conspiracy that involved a construction cartel. Its revelation led to the imprisonment of dozens of politicians and businessmen.\n\nSome of the payments were made in cash at Trafigura\u2019s office in Rio de Janeiro, according to court documents. To generate that cash for the bribes \u2014 coded as \u201ccommissions\u201d by those involved \u2014 a Trafigura executive used \u201cillicit-market money exchangers\u201d in Brazil known as \u201cdoleiros\u201d, as well as making wire transfers.\n\nIn order to facilitate delivery of the bribes, the co-conspirators sent an invoice from a Hong Kong company for purported consulting services related to buying floor and wall tiles from Brazil for $390,240. Trafigura paid that sum to one of the co-conspirators, who then paid the money into a Hong Kong account for the ultimate benefit of Petrobras officials.\n\nThe DoJ gave Trafigura credit for its co-operation and remedial measures, but not for voluntary disclosure.\n\nTrafigura\u2019s plea marks the first time that it has admitted to wrongdoing in the Car Wash scandal, following rivals Glencore and Vitol admitting to having made bribes in the country in order to settle broader corruption probes into them.\n\nIn 2018, Brazilian prosecutors charged two former Trafigura executives Mariano Marcondes Ferraz and Marcio Pinto de Magalh\u00e3es for allegedly paying bribes of about $1.5mn.\n\nThe civil case into Trafigura in Brazil for the Car Wash scandal has been suspended but some of the $127mn set aside can also be used for settlements with the Brazilian authorities.\n\nThe case draws a line under the DoJ\u2019s current public pursuits of Trafigura, although the group and its former chief operating officer Mike Wainwright still face charges in Switzerland about suspected bribery payments in Angola.\n\nOther commodity trading houses have also been struck with penalties by the DoJ for bribery and corruption in recent years. In 2022, Glencore pleaded guilty to multiple counts of bribery in Africa and Latin America to access oil and received penalties of more than $1bn.\n\nRival oil trader Gunvor also pleaded guilty earlier this month over bribes in Ecuador to secure oil contracts, resulting in more than $660mn in fines and forfeited profits. Oil trader Vitol agreed to pay more than $160mn to authorities in the US and Brazil in 2020 for bribery in Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico.\n\nAdditional reporting by Michael Pooler", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a7b7fabc-b14b-4506-a400-8eef8eccc0c2"}}, {"id": "131424ec-f219-431a-8faa-3e98aa874f8b", "event_name": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva steps up interventions in Brazil\u2019s largest companies", "blurb": "Government involvement in Petrobras and Vale alarms investors as president calls market \u2018voracious dinosaur\u2019", "date": "2024-03-2500:00:00.0", "body": "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s government has been accused of political interference in some of Brazil\u2019s biggest companies, prompting alarm among investors who fear a repeat of heavy-handed interventions from the last period of leftwing rule.\n\nShares in state-controlled oil major Petrobras fell 10 per cent in a single day this month after it opted not to pay extraordinary dividends, contrary to analyst expectations, in a decision that its chief executive said came from Lula and his ministers.\n\nMining company Vale has also been affected after the administration faced accusations, which it denied, of improperly seeking to get a controversial ally of Lula appointed as its next chief executive.\n\nIn addition, Bras\u00edlia has pushed to reverse an element of the privatisation of power utility Eletrobras by previous far-right president Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nIn a still unresolved case, last year it petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a legislative clause capping the government\u2019s voting rights at 10 per cent, below the roughly 40 per cent of equity it still owns in the listed group.\n\nThe controversies have raised the spectre of state activism that often failed or proved costly when Lula\u2019s party was previously in power earlier this century, which following a boom ended in a deep downturn for Latin America\u2019s largest economy.\n\nEduardo Figueiredo, head of Brazilian equities at the UK asset manager Abrdn, said: \u201cGiven past experiences of undue political pressure did not end well, we see these incidents having an impact beyond the companies mentioned\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009ultimately making it harder for Brazil to attract investments.\u201d\n\nA former trade unionist who governed for two terms between 2003 and 2011, Lula\u2019s election manifesto in 2022 called for a bigger role for the state and higher public spending, with the goal of boosting living standards in the nation of 200mn.\n\nDuring the campaign he promised to manage the economy with moderation, but recent antagonistic remarks by the 78-year-old veteran politician have dismayed the business class.\n\n\u201cBrazilian companies need to agree with the Brazilian government\u2019s development thinking. That\u2019s what we want,\u201d he said last month, after saying Vale \u2014 a private-sector multinational \u2014 \u201cbelongs to Brazil\u201d.\n\nAfter Petrobras\u2019s share price drop, Lula described the market as a \u201cvoracious dinosaur\u201d that \u201cwants everything for itself, nothing for the people\u201d.\n\nThe noise around Brazil\u2019s two most internationally successful enterprises has caused concern in corporate circles, where executives had hoped that Lula\u2019s pragmatism would dominate his second stint in office.\n\nThe leftist\u2019s earlier presidency was characterised by steady growth and a widening middle class, with millions lifted out of poverty. He largely stuck to economic orthodoxy during his first four-year mandate, before shifting towards fiscal expansion and interventionist policies.\n\nThis more statist approach was turbocharged by his chosen successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was blamed by many Brazilians for dragging the country into its worst recession on record a decade ago, contributing to her 2016 impeachment.\n\nOver 13 years in office, Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, or PT, lavished cheap public loans on favoured industries and companies to create \u201cnational champions\u201d such as meatpacker JBS, with mixed results. Many big infrastructure projects went unfinished.\n\nInvestor sentiment towards the South American nation has recently \u201cdeteriorated\u201d, said Thierry Larose, emerging markets bond portfolio manager at Swiss bank Vontobel.\n\n\u201cThese random statements by Lula are absolutely counterproductive,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame because he\u2019s done well in the past and the current state of the economy is not so bad.\u201d\n\nWith robust gross domestic product growth of nearly 3 per cent last year and a strong trade balance, the country risked wasting a favourable moment by \u201ctrying to re-implement old toxic policies\u201d, he added.\n\nMario Marconini, managing director at political consultancy Teneo, said the various episodes \u201call align with Lula\u2019s antiquated view of how the government can and should intervene in \u2018Brazilian champions\u2019, since they somehow \u2018owe it\u2019 to the population\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt also reveals the president\u2019s increasing need to resort to catchphrases that might restore decreasing popularity,\u201d added Marconini.\n\nThe presidency insisted there had been no political interference in any of the cases. It said Petrobras\u2019s ordinary shares had gained more than 60 per cent since the start of Lula\u2019s third term, while the company recently posted the second-highest profit in its history.\n\nLula\u2019s backers have insisted the government has the right to influence Petrobras, given it is the controlling shareholder with just over half of voting power.\n\nHowever, opponents fear a repeat of the mismanagement of the PT years, when fuel subsidies enforced by the government to tame inflation cost the company an estimated $40bn. Petrobras was also at the centre of a massive bribery scandal revealed in the vast \u201cCar Wash\u201d investigation.\n\nWhile Bolsonaro fired a series of Petrobras chief executives in anger at high fuel prices, he otherwise left the company to pursue its strategy of divestments as it focused on petroleum production and profits.\n\nBy contrast, Lula wants it to reduce shareholder payouts in favour of greater investment in areas such as renewables and refineries, aiming to stimulate economic activity.\n\nIn the case of Vale, corporate governance experts said there was no legal basis for government involvement in chief executive selection at the group, which was privatised in 1997 and is one of the world\u2019s largest iron ore suppliers.\n\nAn independent board member at the miner resigned this month alleging \u201cnefarious political influence\u201d in its leadership succession process.\n\nOfficially Bras\u00edlia only has a dozen special \u201cgolden shares\u201d in the company that grant veto rights such as blocking a change in name or relocation of headquarters, but in practice it can exert sway through the pension fund of a state-controlled bank that is among Vale\u2019s top investors.\n\nThe government has now ditched attempts to place Guido Mantega, a former PT finance minister, at the helm of Vale, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nEnergy and mines minister Alexandre Silveira denied there had been intrusion at either Vale or Petrobras. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t stop us, as policymakers and regulators, from keeping a firm hand on the companies with regard to the country\u2019s interests,\u201d he told the Financial Times.\n\nLula supporters say his industrial policy to revive Brazilian manufacturing is already bearing fruit, with investments totalling $14bn announced so far in 2024 by global carmakers.\n\nWith Brazil\u2019s congress dominated by conservatives, analysts said the president could encounter a backlash if he shifted in a more radical direction.\n\nJive Investments chair Luiz Fernando Figueiredo said: \u201cWithout a doubt, the [government\u2019s] impulse is terrible. Once again, we\u2019re going to test our institutions to see how much they can resist.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Jamie Smyth, Myles McCormick and Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0826a3ab-a5d0-444d-84ca-48606b682876"}}, {"id": "a774af80-2e5d-42e7-be1b-6d92262e9483", "event_name": "Brazil police recommend criminal charges against ex-president Jair Bolsonaro", "blurb": "Former leader faces first potential indictment on claims of false vaccination certificates and \u2018criminal association\u2019", "date": "2024-03-1900:00:00.0", "body": "Federal police in Brazil have recommended that former president Jair Bolsonaro face criminal charges over claims he faked Covid-19 vaccine certificates, in what would mark the first formal indictment against the rightwing ex-leader.\n\nPolice also accused Bolsonaro of \u201ccriminal association\u201d, or conspiracy, in a report released on Tuesday.

Last year, Brazil exported more than $104bn worth of goods to China, while importing $53bn.\n\nOf the 101mn metric tonnes of soyabeans shipped from Brazil last year, 70 per cent, worth about $39bn, went to China.\n\nOne of the most recent investigations was launched earlier this month following a request by CSN, a large Brazilian steel producer, which alleged that between July 2022 and June 2023 imports of particular types of carbon steel sheets from China rose almost 85 per cent.\n\nIn opening the probe, which is scheduled to take 18 months, the industry ministry said there were \u201csufficient elements that indicate the practice of dumping in exports from China to Brazil\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and damage to the domestic industry resulting from such practice\u201d.\n\nBrazilian steelmakers have requested the government slap tariffs of between 9.6 per cent and 25 per cent on imported steel products. Overall imports of steel and iron from China rose from $1.6bn in 2014 to $2.7bn last year.\n\nSoaring steel imports are a particular sore spot for the Brazilian government as the Latin American nation is one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of iron ore \u2014 a primary ingredient in steel production.\n\nChemicals and tyres are also points of contention, with the industry ministry launching separate investigations in recent months. According to official data, imports from China of the chemical phthalic anhydride rose more than 2,000 per cent in volume terms between July 2018 and June 2023. In the same period, imports of tyres grew more than 100 per cent to 47mn units from 23mn units, with roughly 80 per cent coming from China.\n\nBrazil is not the only emerging market to voice concerns about the surge in industrial products from China. In Thailand, the government has accused Chinese companies of evading anti-dumping duties, while industry groups have warned of big losses from cheaper steel in the market.\n\nVietnam\u2019s government has launched\u00a0investigations into dumping of wind towers and some steel products from China after complaints from the local industries.\n\nIn August last year Mexico imposed tariffs of 5-25 per cent on imports of hundreds of goods from countries with which it does not have a free trade agreement, with China being one of the countries most affected.\n\nThe tariffs were put in place amid increasing pressure from US officials, who have suggested that Mexico is not doing enough to clarify the origins of steel imports from third countries, in what trade experts say is a reference to China.\n\nThe Chinese government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. It has consistently attacked what it calls \u201cprotectionism\u201d, particularly by the US and the EU.\n\nAdditional reporting by Christine Murray, Ciara Nugent and Joe Daniels", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8703874e-44cb-4197-8dca-c7b555da8aef"}}, {"id": "872e5005-52ea-4f32-900d-d1ed3b4f58b0", "event_name": "The precarious future facing Brazil\u2019s new boomtowns", "blurb": "Agriculture is creating fast wealth and boosting the nation\u2019s economy.

But three years ago he traded them in to move more than 1,500km west to the remote town in the sweltering heart of Brazil.\n\n\u201cI made a bet,\u201d says Yamagata from his notary office overlooking the main square. \u201cThis place is going to be huge one day.\u201d\n\nLike many before him, the 44-year-old is chasing a boom that is transforming not only Boa Esperan\u00e7a, but the entire central-west region of Brazil. It is a boom not of semiconductors or artificial intelligence, but of agriculture and agribusiness. Or as the locals simply call it: \u201cagro\u201d.\n\nFuelled by surging global demand for food, particularly from China, the sector has in recent years emerged as a key engine of Latin America\u2019s largest economy, today accounting for about 25 per cent of gross domestic product. This is up from 18 per cent a decade ago. Indirectly or directly, it employs 27 per cent of the population, according to the Center for Applied Studies on Advanced Economics, at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nAgriculture is now almost single-handedly propping up the nation\u2019s economic fortunes. In the first quarter of 2023, the sector grew by an extraordinary 21 per cent and by more than 15 per cent across the year. This growth \u2014 the strongest since 1996, according to available data \u2014 helped bolster overall national growth, which surpassed expectations at 2.9 per cent.\n\nNowhere is the boom in agro more visible than in Mato Grosso, a state larger than France and Germany combined, which has a western border with Bolivia and a northern frontier with the Amazon rainforest. Historically a desolate backwater, the state \u2014 which is home to Boa Esperan\u00e7a \u2014 is today one of Brazil\u2019s richest, with a flourishing number of millionaires and billionaires.\n\n\u201cHere is the future,\u201d says Francisco Pereira, who runs a shop in Sorriso, the self-styled \u201ccapital of Brazilian agriculture\u201d in Mato Grosso. \u201cThere is just so much money. And every year it grows more.\u201d\n\nNeighbouring Boa Esperan\u00e7a is poised to be the next boomtown. After years of legal wrangling, the town \u2014 whose name translates as Good Hope \u2014 will next year become Brazil\u2019s newest official municipality when the first ever administration takes office.\n\nThis will entitle it to a share of government tax revenues and a slew of new public services and projects. It will also establish it as a zone for investments and locals are braced for an influx of cash and people into the soyabean and corn economy.\n\n\u201cEveryone is dazzled by the growth so far. But we believe more is to come,\u201d says Calebe Francio, a local large landowner who is expected to contest \u2014 and win \u2014 Boa Esperan\u00e7a\u2019s first mayoral elections in October. \u201cWith a local administration, it can be more dynamic.\u201d\n\nLooming on the horizon, however, is a potential threat to the success of Boa Esperan\u00e7a, Mato Grosso and Brazil\u2019s agro boom: the changing climate.\n\nLast year, Brazil had its hottest year on record and Mato Grosso and its central agricultural belt were the hottest locations, with temperatures 2C above average. The extreme temperatures, combined with a lack of rain, sharply hit production, with yields of soyabeans, the key cash crop, forecast to have fallen more than 20 per cent. In some parts of the state the drop is expected to be even worse.\n\nBrazil\u2019s agriculture minister called the situation, which coincided with low international soyabean prices, an \u201cimminent crisis\u201d for the sector.\n\nMany local farmers \u2014 touchy about environmental issues due to global headlines about Brazilian deforestation \u2014 chalk it up to the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o, a natural and cyclical phenomenon, which results in warmer weather that they cannot control.\n\nBut large producers, as well as agronomists and scientists, are already bracing for a more unstable future, with investments in new technologies and farming methods.\n\n\u201cGlobal warming is intensifying weather events, so the droughts are stronger, the storms are stronger,\u201d says Aurelio Pavinato, chief executive of SLC Agr\u00edcola, one of the world\u2019s largest agricultural producers, which is investing in genetically modified seeds to protect against drought. \u201cThe weather events are becoming more intense, so the damage to our crops will become more intense.\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate change was once something a bit ethereal,\u201d says Fernando Rossi, a fazendeiro \u2014 or farmer \u2014 from the central-west state of Goi\u00e1s. \u201cBut it has now become very concrete.\u201d\n\nBrazil leads the world in the production of a vast number of foodstuffs from beef and chicken to coffee, orange juice and many fruits and vegetables. Agricultural exports have powered the nation\u2019s record trade surplus, which last year reached almost $100bn, up 60 per cent from the previous year.\n\nIn the yawning fields surrounding Boa Esperan\u00e7a and Sorriso, the crop of choice is soyabeans, which the farmers typically rotate with corn over the course of two harvests per year.\n\nLast year, soyabeans were Brazil\u2019s biggest export, representing about 16 per cent of the total in dollar terms. The Latin American country is also the world\u2019s biggest exporter of the oilseed, having overtaken the US about a decade ago.\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of the produce goes to China, where it is mixed with corn to feed chicken and pigs, which are in turn consumed by the country\u2019s increasingly carnivorous population. But soyabeans can also be used for a variety of oils and soy-based products, such as tofu.\n\nBefore the recent downturn in prices, the crop was so lucrative that denizens of Mato Grosso called it \u201cgreen gold\u201d. Alongside cotton and corn, the bean has transformed the state.\n\n\u201cWhen we arrived, there wasn\u2019t even a city. Today we have practically everything,\u201d says Sadi Beledelli, a local farmer who moved to the Sorriso region in the 1980s from Brazil\u2019s southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nMigration, particularly from the country\u2019s southern states, fuelled the growth of Mato Grosso\u2019s agricultural belt. But none of it would have been possible without technological advancements, including the genetic modification of crops and new methods of soil fertilisation, which turned once hardscrabble lands into some of the world\u2019s most bountiful.\n\n\u201cIt is a land of opportunities. We are growing in leaps and bounds,\u201d says Ari Lafin, mayor of Sorriso, which is home to about 110,000 people.\n\nSipping chimarr\u00e3o, a herbal drink popular in Brazil\u2019s south, Lafin says the population of Sorriso is growing at 20 per cent a year. GDP, he adds, jumped from some $800mn in 2017 to almost $3bn in 2022.\n\nThis new wealth is evident. New mansions dot the city\u2019s manicured boulevards. Imported pick-up trucks cruise its wide streets.\n\n\u201cIn my hometown [in the south of Brazil] I never saw a Ram,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o, a recent arrival in Sorriso, referring to the large pick-up trucks that can sell for $100,000. \u201cHere I see five on my way home from work.\u201d\n\nA recent study of an elite group within Brazil\u2019s richest people \u2014 those in the 0.1 per cent \u2014 found that the highest earners were from Mato Grosso, according to the Fiscal Policy Observatory at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.\n\n\u201cIn terms of state GDP per capita, today it is among the highest in the country,\u201d says S\u00e9rgio Gobetti, an economist who authored the study. But he highlights that inequality is also growing, with the wealth heavily concentrated among the landowners \u2014 typically from Brazil\u2019s south \u2014 and not the workers, usually from the country\u2019s poorer north-east.\n\nTwo hours east of Sorriso through vast, flat soy plantations, Boa Esperan\u00e7a is beginning to experience its boom. The town still retains a frontier quality; its entrance is dominated by a large silo complex, where dozens of articulated lorries idle, waiting for the next shipment of soyabeans. The population at 7,000 is small.\n\nBut locals expect the economy to surge once its status as an official municipality is formalised at the beginning of next year.\n\n\u201cIt has already developed a lot and it should develop more with the establishment of the city,\u201d says Gabriela Arquaz, who moved to Boa Esperan\u00e7a five years ago. \u201cFor those who come to invest in real estate, it is great. Growth is certain.\u201d\n\nThe optimism is echoed by Francio, the local landowner. \u201cThink about the people waiting decades for this moment. Everyone is excited, everyone is ready to make investments.\u201d\n\nAmid the excitement, few in the region seem perturbed by Brazil\u2019s increasingly extreme climate. A common refrain is the \u201cstability\u201d of Mato Grosso\u2019s weather.\n\nAware of their portrayal in Europe and elsewhere as environmental villains, the region\u2019s politicians and producers go to great lengths to underline their commitment to ecological regulations and preserving forests and waterways.\n\n\u201cMacron needs to come here and know the reality,\u201d says Lafin, referring to French President Emmanuel Macron, who is a source of popular derision because of his criticisms linking Brazilian agribusiness to deforestation.\n\nDespite the mayor\u2019s comments, however, Mato Grosso \u2014 which translates as thick forest \u2014 has historically had one of the highest rates of deforestation in Brazil. Last year, deforestation in the savannah biome that dominates the wider region rose by 43 per cent, according to official data.\n\nThere is also broader reluctance among the typically conservative farmers to acknowledge \u2014 and prepare for \u2014 a globally changing climate. Last year, Brazil experienced an unprecedented nationwide heatwave, serious flooding in the south and a historic, punishing drought in the Amazon. The rainforest is particularly important because its water-recycling ecosystem creates the rainfall necessary to nourish the fields of Mato Grosso.\n\nThe effects of these weather events on agro were immediate. In Mato Grosso, farmers are forecast to report their lowest soyabean yield in at least 15 years, with an average 52.12 bags per hectare, 10 bags fewer than the previous harvest, according to data from EarthDaily Agro, an analytics group.\n\nNational soyabean production is projected to have fallen to about 150mn metric tonnes this year, down from 162mn last year, according to data from MD Commodities. Final official data will be available next month.\n\n\u201cAgro is already being impacted by climate change,\u201d says Paula Packer, head of environment at Embrapa, an agricultural research and development agency widely credited with laying the foundations for Brazil\u2019s agricultural boom.\n\nWhile farmers in Mato Grosso will acknowledge the impact of El Ni\u00f1o, they shy away from scientific assessments that the weather phenomenon is being exacerbated by rising global temperatures.\n\n\u201cFarmers are conservative,\u201d says Packer. \u201cBut in the medium or long term they will [act] to prevent losses in their harvests.\u201d\n\nShe says one option is the use of biologicals, or bacteria that can be added to the crop during planting to act as a type of moisturiser \u201cso the plant can survive when you have drought\u201d.\n\nAnother is the development of more weather-resistant genetically modified crops. This is the approach being taken by SLC Agr\u00edcola, which runs huge soy, corn and cotton plantations in Mato Grosso and across the nation.\n\n\u201cHB4 is the name of the technology. It is a genetically modified crop, which consumes less water and is more resilient,\u201d says Pavinato. \u201cDuring a drought, with the normal variety, we might lose 30 per cent of the yield. With HB4, we might lose 15 per cent and save 15 per cent.\u201d\n\nPavinato also highlights the importance of soil management. Simpler techniques, such as the use of cover crops and no-till farming, can prevent erosion, improve soil health and make it more resilient to a harsher climate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think climate change will reverse all the gains that Mato Grosso has achieved, but the challenge will be to maintain the pace of development,\u201d says Felippe Serigati, a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation\u2019s centre of agribusiness studies.\n\n\u201cThe future that we see today for the region we may not be able to achieve, precisely due to climate change.\u201d\n\nThere are other risks, albeit indirect, facing Mato Grosso.\n\nFor a start, countries that previously could not efficiently produce soyabeans will start increasing their productivity as a result of the changing climate.\n\nSerigati says increased competition could come from Russia or parts of eastern Europe, where land is already \u201cbecoming more productive and there are regions with complete conditions to produce\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe market is not static. Brazil used to export chicken to Russia. Today Russia is an exporter,\u201d he says.\n\nThe economic slowdown in China presents another challenge. Of Brazil\u2019s total 101mn metric tonnes of soyabean exports last year, 70 per cent went to the Asian nation. But agricultural analysts say Beijing is seeking both to diversify its suppliers as well as replace soyabeans with a cheaper alternative, such as a greater corn mix.\n\n\u201cIn my view, the major boom in Chinese demand is over, at least for now,\u201d says Pedro Dejneka, partner at MD Commodities.\n\n\u201cChinese soy demand has been relatively \u2018static\u2019 since around 2015. It is a completely different picture from the growth of more than 600 per cent that we saw between 2000 and 2015.\u201d\n\nSuch assessments do not cloud the optimism of the mato grossense, however. Lafin, the mayor, is confident that demand from China will continue. He also cites India as a potential new growth market, although analysts caution that the world\u2019s most populous nation does not yet have the income level nor industrialised meat sector to handle Brazil\u2019s massive production.\n\n\u201cBrazil\u2019s vocation is agriculture. It is to feed the world,\u201d says Lafin. \u201cEating better will require business, so I\u2019m sure [the Brazilian agro sector] will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nThis faith is shared by Yamagata, the notary in Boa Esperan\u00e7a, whose belief in the future of Brazil\u2019s new boomtown is unshakeable.\n\n\u201cI came here never to leave,\u201d he says. \u201cI made a bet and I am fully committed to it.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1e991b99-3978-4c87-838a-aea6130b6fe5"}}, {"id": "7c213ebe-fdfa-4eba-9791-1f6432f6a438", "event_name": "Brazil rolls out dengue vaccines as cases rise sharply", "blurb": "Infections quadruple from last year after warnings that warming temperatures will increase cases", "date": "2024-02-2500:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil is scrambling to roll out new vaccines against dengue fever after the number of cases of the mosquito-borne disease more than quadrupled from last year\u2019s rates.\n\nThe sharp increase, which has prompted several states to declare health emergencies and the Rio de Janeiro government to declare an epidemic, came after health officials warned of a rise in cases due to warmer weather from climate change and the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.\n\nThe country has reported more than 700,000 cases so far this year, up sharply from the 165,000 cases in the same period of 2023. More than 100 deaths have been reported from the virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause high fever, muscle pain and internal bleeding.\n\nThe health ministry warned earlier this year that the number of dengue cases could reach a record 5mn in 2024, a more than threefold increase from the 1.65mn cases recorded last year, which resulted in 1,094 deaths. The previous record was 1.68mn cases in 2015.\n\nThe number of dengue cases typically peaks in April before tapering off, although health officials have said that rising global temperatures will allow the mosquitoes that carry the virus to thrive for longer. Last year Brazil reported its hottest year on record.\n\nArgentina and Paraguay have also reported a surge in dengue cases. The Argentine ministry of health this week said 48,000 cases had been recorded between late July 2023 and mid-February, compared with just 1,000 in the same period a year earlier.\n\nN\u00edsia Trindade, Brazil\u2019s health minister, said: \u201cNow is the time for all of Brazil to unite against dengue. This is the time to intensify care and prevention\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. After 40 years of dealing with dengue epidemics, we now have an important scientific achievement: a vaccine.\u201d\n\nThis month Brazil started distributing a vaccine produced by Japanese pharmaceutical group Takeda. Known as Qdenga, the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 80.2 per cent and consists of two shots with a three-month interval between them.\n\nBecause of supply bottlenecks, the vaccine is primarily being administered to children between the age of 10 and 14, who are the group most often hospitalised with the virus after elderly people. Regulators have not yet approved the vaccine for senior citizens.\n\nTrindade said Brazil was the first country to incorporate a dengue vaccine into its free public health system. The S\u00e3o Paulo-based Butantan Institute has also developed a vaccine, but it has yet to be approved by regulators.\n\nThe disease is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which thrives in pools of stagnant water.\n\n\u201cThe poorest regions suffer the most because of the housing conditions and urban structure that support the spread of mosquitoes. Mortality is higher among the poorest,\u201d said Alberto Chebabo, president of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now in the rainy and hot season, so we can\u2019t reverse the proliferation of the mosquito.

But the west\u2019s relatively muted response to the rapidly mounting death toll in Gaza \u2014 in contrast to its immediate and repeated denunciation of Russian killing in Ukraine \u2014 exposed what some developing nations see as hypocrisy and double standards.\n\nIn opening remarks to the G20, Brazil\u2019s foreign minister Mauro Vieira contrasted the nations of the North, tied by the Nato military alliance, with those of the south, which were \u201ccovered by various layers and zones of peace and co-operation\u201d.\n\nAs the Gaza death toll mounted, Brazil\u2019s Brics ally South Africa opened a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice last month alleging genocide against the Palestinian people, a charge the Jewish state strongly rejected.\n\n\u201cSome have told us to mind our own business.

We, as South Africans, will not be passive bystanders and watch the crimes that were visited upon us being perpetrated elsewhere,\u201d Ramaphosa added.\n\nAt the African Union summit in Addis Ababa where Lula spoke last weekend, leaders lined up to condemn Israel\u2019s offensive against Hamas in Gaza, which Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 29,000 people. Hamas\u2019s attacks on Israel on October 7, which prompted the war in Gaza, killed 1,200 people and 250 were taken hostage.\n\nMoussa Faki, chair of the African Union Commission, said Israel\u2019s offensive was the \u201cmost flagrant\u201d violation of international law and accused Israel of wanting to \u201cexterminate\u201d Gaza\u2019s inhabitants.

Kenya, Ghana, Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo have voiced support, but they are in the minority.\n\nIsrael retains some other allies in the developing world, notably India\u2019s nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Argentina\u2019s libertarian president Javier Milei.\n\nBut experts say the heavy death toll in Gaza has triggered an unprecedented hardening of attitudes against the Jewish state in the developing world.\n\n\u201cWhat has been unfolding in Gaza and [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu\u2019s intransigence has generated a pretty united picture in Latin America that goes beyond left and right politics,\u201d said Michael Shifter, former president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think-tank. \u201cIt\u2019s deeper than that.\u201d\n\nThe presidents of Colombia and Bolivia rushed to support Lula, while Mexico and Chile have asked the Hague-based International Criminal Court to investigate Israel for possible crimes against civilians in Gaza, even though Israel does not recognise the court\u2019s authority.\n\nClaudio Epelman, executive director of the Latin American Jewish Congress, raised the concern that the Brazilian government\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d position on the war in Gaza had provided cover for politicians close to Lula to take anti-Jewish positions.\n\nJose Geno\u00edno, a former president of Lula\u2019s party, alarmed Brazil\u2019s 150,000-strong Jewish community when he called last month for a boycott of Jewish-owned businesses \u201cto hurt economic interests\u201d. Far from condemning his remarks, two of Lula\u2019s cabinet ministers supported him.\n\nModi\u2019s government in India has cultivated close ties with Israel since taking power in 2014 and has refrained from condemning the Gaza offensive. But it has lamented the loss of life, sent humanitarian aid to Gaza and reiterated India\u2019s support for the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state.\n\nUnions and a swath of Indian civil society, however, have voiced opposition. A union representing port workers last week said it would refuse to load or unload weapons to Israel \u201cin solidarity with a call by Palestinian trade unions\u201d.\n\nThe ICJ case, meanwhile, burnishes South Africa\u2019s portrayal of itself as an alternative to a world order it sees as based on western hegemony. Ramaphosa led vocal denunciations of western vaccine nationalism during the pandemic, and has cast the recent expansion of the Brics grouping as a bulwark against western economic interests.\n\n\u201cThey saw an opportunity to test the [international] system, and that\u2019s precisely what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Piers Pigou, Southern Africa programme head at the Institute of Security Studies.\n\nFGV\u2019s Stuenkel noted that the divergence between the west and the developing world over Gaza is mirrored in Ukraine; in both conflicts, many emerging powers have repudiated war and called for negotiations to find a peaceful solution.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the two most visible global conflicts at this point \u2014 Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas \u2014 on both, there\u2019s quite a division between the global north and the global south,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7e447eed-e4cd-4647-a044-e2808956bba3"}}, {"id": "f6d7ee16-2382-43bc-9e2f-42fc9b597623", "event_name": "Brazilian football: the next frontier in global sport?", "blurb": "The country is unrivalled as a talent factory, but its clubs are barely known overseas. International investors hope a new league could change that ", "date": "2024-02-1200:00:00.0", "body": "For the long-suffering fans of Botafogo, it seemed that glory was finally in sight.\n\nLess than two years after being rescued from financial ruin by an American businessman, the Rio de Janeiro football club found itself the unexpected favourite to be crowned champions for the first time in almost three decades.\n\nThe football fairytale was to end in heartache. Having led Brazil\u2019s top division for most of last season, with a 14-point margin at one point, the team failed to win any of its last 11 matches and finished in fifth place.\n\nThe dramatic finale to the Brazilian S\u00e9rie A has drawn attention to a broader effort to modernise the business side of the game in the world\u2019s most famous footballing nation.\n\nThe reforms, which include discussions about a new league modelled on English football, are attracting high-profile backers, including Emirati royalty and multiclub conglomerates, who view Brazil as a next frontier in the global sports industry.\n\n\u201cThe collapse of our championship campaign was painful,\u201d says John Textor, the US tech entrepreneur and football investor who owns Botafogo. \u201cBut people forget it was a bankrupt club only two years earlier.\u201d\n\nTextor\u2019s acquisition of a 90 per cent stake of Botafogo in early 2022 through his company Eagle Football Holdings, along with promises to inject R$400mn ($80mn) of funding, was among the first in a wave of deals.\n\n\u201cI said we\u2019re going to be fighting for titles within three to five years. Well, we\u2019re already there. I\u2019m very proud of what we built\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[We are] increasing our revenues and becoming more sustainable.\u201d\n\nBrazilian football is one of the enigmas of global sport. The country enjoys a near-unrivalled status as a talent factory \u2014 most of the biggest clubs in the world, from Real Madrid to Manchester City, boast Brazilian stars on their rosters. Yet many of its own major clubs have long underperformed off the pitch \u2014 and are barely known outside of Brazil.\n\nA lack of professional management has been blamed for the weak financial position of many clubs and a failure to realise the sport\u2019s commercial potential. This is exacerbated by the early departure of many of the country\u2019s best players to European leagues, with the allure of much bigger salaries.\n\nNic Hamer at Oakwell Sports Advisory says he is witnessing \u201chuge interest\u201d from prospective investors. \u201cThere are very few markets in football where there\u2019s this sort of opportunity across all revenue lines,\u201d he adds. \u201c[Brazilian] clubs generally are undercommercialised. In the long term, I don\u2019t see why Brazil can\u2019t break into the top five leagues by turnover.\u201d\n\nFor now, that remains a way off. Total turnover in Brazil\u2019s first division was R$6.9bn (\u20ac1.3bn) in 2022, found a study by the consultancy Convocados \u2014 well below the revenues earned by the top five leagues in Europe.\n\nIn a bid to raise broadcast receipts, proposals are also afoot to create a new nationwide competition in Brazil that is capable of reaching a much wider overseas audiences.\n\nAt present, local giants such as Flamengo, Corinthians and reigning title-holders Palmeiras can only dream of the kind of international brand recognition built up over years by European counterparts such as Barcelona, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nThe great hope of fans and executives alike is that more money will convince younger stars to stay at home for longer. This can unlock a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, says Bruno Amaral, head of mergers and acquisitions at investment bank BTG Pactual. \u201cIt\u2019s going to represent a big improvement in the attractiveness of matches, leading to better revenues both locally and internationally and will make the clubs stronger,\u201d he adds.\n\nBut to succeed, the grand plans will have to overcome the infighting and questionable practices that have often blighted the domestic game and stunted its off-field development.\n\n\u201cBrazilian football has always been very political,\u201d says Ricardo Fort, founder of sports consultancy Sport by Fort. \u201cThis has proven to be an obstacle, because the clubs have allowed their on-field rivalries to be a barrier to them working together.\u201d\n\nThe catalyst for change in Brazilian football was a 2021 law encouraging clubs to operate as businesses, instead of the traditional model of non-profit associations. Previously, only two top-flight clubs were run as companies.\n\nBy creating a novel corporate structure that enjoys favourable tax rates, the legislation has opened the door to investors.\n\nTextor was one of the new entrants to Brazil. His company also owns Olympique Lyonnais, Belgian team RWD Molenbeek and a minority stake in south London side Crystal Palace. In Botafogo, he found a club with a rich history \u2014 Man\u00e9 Garrincha, one of the stars of the Brazil sides that won the 1958 and 1962 World Cups, played for the team in its heyday \u2014 but which had fallen on hard times in recent years. The club won promotion from the second division in 2021.\n\nShortly before Textor agreed the deal for Botafogo, former superstar and World Cup winner Ronaldo acquired a controlling stake in his boyhood club Cruzeiro.\n\nMiami-based investment firm 777 Partners, which counts England\u2019s Everton in its portfolio of teams, took a majority stake in Vasco da Gama in Rio. Esporte Clube Bahia was bought by City Football Group, the Abu Dhabi-controlled owner of a dozen sides including Manchester City.\n\nThe new company template, known by its Portuguese acronym SAF, is a radical break from the conventional system of clubs controlled by members, with a president chosen every few years. Critics say the old set-up frequently led to maladministration and overspending, with some leaders elected due to popularity rather than management abilities.\n\n\u201cIn the association model, you can\u2019t design something for the medium and long-term, a real business platform,\u201d says Pedro Daniel, executive director at EY in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cThis results in unpredictability and a high risk for all the stakeholders.\u201d\n\nUnpaid bills or wages have not been uncommon at Brazilian clubs and in the past there have even been cases of corruption, embezzlement and match-fixing.\n\n\u201cSAFs bring more planning and a professional perception, which can attract new sponsors [with] greater security and less risk,\u201d adds Daniel. \u201cThere is fiscal responsibility and incentives for good management \u2014 but the numbers don\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the already high levels of indebtedness among S\u00e9rie A clubs increased 9 per cent to a combined R$10bn in 2022, according to Convocados.\n\nPast ventures into Brazilian football by outsiders have rarely succeeded. A handful of partnerships struck in the late-1990s by names such as Bank of America and private equity firm Hicks & Muse were wound down within a few years.\n\nBut some industry veterans believe the new legal framework provides a structure for investments, along with a mechanism for resolving heavy debtloads.\n\nUnder the new model, the legacy association transfers football activities to the SAF, but retains other sports and social functions \u2014 as well as prior obligations and liabilities. One-fifth of the new entity\u2019s revenues must go to paying down these historic debts.\n\nThe initial takeover deals were clubs in financial distress with scant other options, says sports lawyer Eduardo Carlezzo. He reckons the law is working. \u201cBotafogo, which was always broken, almost became champions,\u201d he says. \u201cThe SAF [model] is rehabilitating clubs that were destroyed.\u201d\n\nAs evidence of its turnaround, Botafogo says debts have decreased from an initial R$1bn to an estimated R$740mn at the end of 2023; it hopes to agree a further restructuring with creditors in the months ahead. Revenues meanwhile increased from R$140mn in 2022 to R$402mn last year. Textor says the target is to break even next year.\n\nThe Rio club\u2019s chief executive Thairo Arruda puts the early success down to administrative restructuring coupled with a more entrepreneurial mindset. Membership promotions and ticket discounts have led to sellout games, while the stadium has begun to host music shows. When Taylor Swift brought her Eras tour to Rio de Janeiro last year, she played at the Botafogo stadium.\n\nBotafogo has also invested heavily in scouting talent but its ambitions go deeper, says Arruda: \u201cIt\u2019s in our plan to develop the infrastructure to be one of the greatest academies in the country.\u201d\n\nTo reformers of the game in Brazil, the ultimate goal is the establishment of a new tournament controlled by the clubs, rather than the national confederation.\n\nInspired by the English Premier League, the idea is to turbocharge the marketing of TV and other media rights by selling them collectively. Until now, Brazilian clubs have signed contracts on an individual basis with the country\u2019s largest media group, Globo.\n\nIn theory, centralising rights will not only give greater bargaining power, but open up a slew of other fronts for new income streams and improvements. This ranges from how the product is packaged and fixture schedules through to the sale of data to gambling companies.\n\nThe global football media rights market was worth $19bn in 2023, according to data provider SportsBusiness. Although competition for viewers is tough, Brazilian football\u2019s reputation for flair is an inherent advantage, says Adam Kelly, president of media at IMG.\n\n\u201cIt is a chance to spot the talent of tomorrow and see some incredible skills,\u201d he says, adding that streaming platforms and international broadcasters could be possible buyers. \u201cYou could launch a brand new service [showing games] and be successful in season one.\u201d\n\nAnother attraction is the highly competitive nature of the spectacle: five clubs were still contenders for the title with a handful of games left in the 2023 season. There is also potential to expand domestic audiences in a country of 200mn people, given relatively low attendances at some grounds, say experts.\n\nHowever, for a new league to take shape there must first be the unification of two rival camps with differing views on how revenues should be shared out.\n\nThe first group, known as the Libra project, counts 19 clubs across the top three divisions, including the four largest by revenues and supporter bases. It is in talks with Mubadala Capital over an investment and is being advised by BTG Pactual.\n\nAn arm of the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala has proposed an agency owned 50/50 with the clubs that would have exclusivity to sell their transmission rights, according to people aware of the details.\n\nAn agreement could include a minimum guaranteed income for the clubs, in exchange for the investor receiving an interest in the rights at a later stage, says one person involved in the talks.\n\nThe other grouping is Liga Forte Uni\u00e3o, comprising 26 teams from the top three divisions, and advised by XP, a Brazilian financial services group. It signed a definitive agreement in November with a consortium of investors led by local private equity firm Life Capital Partners (LCP), who paid R$2.6bn for a 20 per cent stake in a media company that will market the rights over a 50-year period. Some R$1.2bn has already been released to the clubs.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the potential for overseas expansion, as roughly 2 per cent of the Brazilian league\u2019s revenues are international,\u201d says LCP founding partner Jo\u00e3o Gabriel Leit\u00e3o. \u201cIt could reach 10 per cent in the next 10 years. We have a huge opportunity to sell the rights outside Brazil.\u201d\n\nFor now, the initiatives are progressing as blocs selling sets of pooled rights. But there is consensus that to reap the full benefits, a single body involving all 40 clubs across the S\u00e9rie A and B must prevail in order to design a brand-new competition.\n\n\u201cIf you just have the sale of the rights, it\u2019s too superficial. The reality is unless you control the tournament, you will never be able to make the structural changes you need in order to grow the league,\u201d says Fort.\n\nOn-off talks have taken place with a view to a merger and common ground has been found, say people involved in the talks.\n\nBut with the current Globo contracts to expire at the end of 2024, the clock is ticking. Libra last week confirmed it would pursue talks with the network for the next four-year broadcast cycle.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t get an agreement and the two blocs negotiate separately [with broadcasters], it will be better than the previous situation, which was one-on-one with clubs. But it won\u2019t maximise the value for Brazilian football,\u201d says one person involved in the talks.\n\nUntil the league situation is clarified, some potential investors in Brazilian clubs will continue to sit on the fence, according to industry figures.\n\nSeven of the 20 S\u00e9rie A clubs now have private owners; the question is, which will be next?\n\n\u201cThe second wave will be about growth, at intermediate or small clubs that are in a better situation but need money to expand,\u201d says Carlezzo the lawyer.\n\nFans have displayed little opposition to takeovers in principle, even if poor results have on occasion sparked criticism of owners from influential supporters\u2019 organisations.\n\nYet among some larger teams there is resistance to the notion of inviting outside shareholders. The presidents of Corinthians and Palmeiras have explicitly ruled out the idea of a SAF, saying that the clubs belong to the fans or that they are already professionally managed.\n\nObservers also warn that the model is not a silver bullet, noting that clubs still need professional management and good governance structures.\n\nBrazil\u2019s most-followed team, Flamengo, won praise for a financial and business turnaround as an association. Its president has spoken of the possibility of a SAF in order to raise finance to build a stadium.\n\nTeams seeking inspiration to challenge the status quo only need look at Red Bull Bragantino, a smaller club in S\u00e3o Paulo state that was acquired by the energy drink brand in 2020 and turned into a limited company before the new law. Having gained promotion under Red Bull it is now considered a contender after finishing in sixth place last year.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian league is probably one of the most competitive in the world. To be in the top half of the table is an achievement for us, fighting against very big clubs,\u201d says managing director Andr\u00e9 Rocha.\n\nBut with the flow of new money, in some quarters there are calls for \u201cfinancial fair play\u201d rules to ensure the competition is not distorted by overspending.\n\nAnd if the Textor era at Botafogo is a test case for the new phase of investments in Brazilian football, it has also shown the game\u2019s habitual controversies are not going away any time soon.\n\nTo many supporters, the side\u2019s on-field capitulation was just further proof of a saying that reflects its perceived bad luck: \u201cSome things only happen to Botafogo\u201d.\n\nBut in the American\u2019s view there were darker forces at play. After Botafogo blew a three-goal lead to lose 4-3 at home to Palmeiras \u2014 a defining moment of the campaign \u2014 Textor alleged corruption in a post-match TV interview on the sidelines. He was fined and temporarily banned from football activities.\n\nAlthough the country\u2019s top sports court agreed the expulsion of a Botafogo player was unfair, it rejected Textor\u2019s calls for an investigation into match-fixing and for six games to be replayed. The club said it intends to pursue further legal action.\n\n\u201cOf everything Textor has done, there are far more positive things than negative,\u201d says Andre Callipo, a Botafogo fan and online football influencer. \u201cIf we manage to win a competition it would be a great act to close the wound.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella\n\nThis article was originally published with a photo caption misidentifying a football team pictured.

The coup plotters would have arrested judicial and congressional leaders, sought to discredit military officers opposed to the coup, and finally enshrined Bolsonaro\u2019s right to stay in power.\n\nThe plot was developed in the run-up to the October 2022 election, but was formalised shortly after Lula\u2019s victory with a draft decree outlining the plans.\n\n\u201cThe police released a lot of evidence showing there was a real plan for a coup. There were draft plans discussed by the president and military officers and there were discussions of logistics and financing,\u201d said Bruno Carazza, a professor at the Dom Cabral foundation.\n\n\u201cAs the coup was already being openly discussed, the next stage would have been the actual attempt.\u201d\n\nThe documents were released on Thursday as dozens of federal police raided the homes of military officers who served in the far-right Bolsonaro administration between 2019-22.\n\nThree aides of the former president were arrested and Bolsonaro himself was ordered to surrender his passport, which he subsequently did. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe investigation\u2019s most prominent target was Almir Garnier, head of the navy during the Bolsonaro government, who police cited as being ready \u201cto put troops on the ground\u201d to help the coup succeed, according to the court documents. Garnier did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe documents also highlight the role of Estevam Theophilo, the head of army ground forces, who pledged to \u201ctake measures to secure the coup\u201d. The general has not made any public comment since being linked to the alleged coup attempt.\n\nReferring to the electoral authorities as the vote approached, Paulo Nogueira, Bolsonaro\u2019s defence minister, said the situation was reminiscent of the moment before two opposing forces meet on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cWhat I feel at this moment is that we are on the line of contact with the enemy,\u201d said Nogueira in a pre-election meeting discussing the potential coup, according to transcripts released by the supreme court. It was not clear how the recordings were obtained.\n\n\u201cI see the armed forces and the ministry of defence in this line of contact. We have to intensify,\u201d said Nogueira, according to the transcript. He could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nBrazil\u2019s electoral court, which oversees the integrity of elections, was a central target of Bolsonaro and the alleged plotters, who for months had repeatedly claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that the polls were rigged in Lula\u2019s favour.\n\nIn particular, they sought to counter the role of Alexandre de Moraes, a supreme court justice who at the time was head of the electoral body and a vocal defender of election integrity.\n\nAccording to police, de Moraes was under surveillance by Bolsonaro allies while the coup was being planned. At one point, the judge\u2019s exact itinerary for the next 15 days was known by the alleged plotters.\n\nOnce the coup began, the goal would have been to arrest de Moraes, as well as supreme court justice Gilmar Mendes and Rodrigo Pacheco, the head of the Senate.\n\nIn one meeting, Augusto Heleno, a general who served as Bolsonaro\u2019s security adviser, suggested using agents from the country\u2019s intelligence service to infiltrate electoral campaigns.\n\n\u201cWhatever has to be done, has to be done before the elections,\u201d he said, according to police transcripts. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBrazil\u2019s last military coup, in 1964, ushered in more than 20 years of military rule. The country still lives with the legacy of that period, analysts said.\n\n\u201cIt is an institutional challenge for Brazil to keep the military away from politics,\u201d said Carazza at the Dom Cabral foundation. \u201cDuring Bolsonaro\u2019s term, the military took a lot of power and were able to influence politics. Facing the possibility [that] Bolsonaro could be defeated, they decided to act to stay in power.\u201d\n\nAs part of the plan, the alleged plotters proposed the abolition of democracy, with Bolsonaro \u2014 a former army captain \u2014 remaining as president. In this new arrangement, the army would act as a \u201cmoderating power\u201d.\n\nAfter Lula won the vote in October 2022, the plot fizzled out because Bolsonaro feared that he did not have enough support from the army. He also lost room for manoeuvre once Lula\u2019s victory was quickly recognised by a broad array of political leaders in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nThe US, which was a pivotal backer of the 1964 coup, also warned Bolsonaro and his allies, publicly and behind the scenes, not to try to cling on to power.\n\n\u201cIt was an extremely dangerous attempt, but it was badly orchestrated because they ended up putting the cart before the horse,\u201d said Eduardo Grin, professor of political science at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. \u201cFirst they wanted to do the coup and then find people to support it.\u201d\n\nIn December 2022, Bolsonaro left Brazil for the US and stayed for three months, missing Lula\u2019s inauguration in January 2023.\n\nThe arrests and seizure of Bolsonaro\u2019s passport point to the potential for the former leader himself to be detained, said political analysts.\n\n\u201cInvestigations will surely advance in the coming weeks and months,\u201d said Christopher Garman of the Eurasia Group. \u201cBut everything points to growing odds of Bolsonaro being arrested.\u201d\n\nGrin said more evidence about the alleged coup plot and the involvement of other politicians would surface in the coming weeks and months.\n\n\u201cThis is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/97582a42-cad7-467a-8f52-9b02d6d5dc16"}}, {"id": "9ee44518-c4d4-40ab-ba0f-bb43c1177bc3", "event_name": "Bolsonaro ordered to surrender passport in Brazil \u2018coup plot\u2019 probe", "blurb": "Three aides to former leader arrested as police set out details of alleged plan to prevent Lula taking office after 2022 polls ", "date": "2024-02-0800:00:00.0", "body": "Brazilian former president Jair Bolsonaro has been ordered to surrender his passport to police in an investigation into an alleged coup attempt by the far-right leader and his associates following his 2022 election defeat.\n\nThe order by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes came as federal police raided the residences of several military officers close to Bolsonaro and arrested three of the former president\u2019s aides.\n\nThe head of Bolsonaro\u2019s rightwing Liberal party, Valdemar Costa Neto, was also arrested. Local media reported that his detention followed the discovery of an illegal weapon in his home during a search.\n\nPolice and supreme court documents allege that Bolsonaro and his allies had created a detailed plan to prevent election winner Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from taking office, including a plot to detain de Moraes, Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes and Rodrigo Pacheco, the president of the Senate.\n\nThe documents made public on Thursday, which were used to support arrest warrants in the case, allege that Bolsonaro\u2019s allies had also arranged among themselves to keep de Moraes \u2014 who at the time was head of the electoral court overseeing the polls \u2014 under surveillance and to intervene if he attempted to stop the coup.\n\nThe documentation, mostly compiled from phone records obtained by police, offers the clearest indication yet of how far Bolsonaro and his allies were allegedly willing to go to prevent his removal from office.\n\nIn the year ahead of the elections in October 2022, Bolsonaro \u2014 a former army captain \u2014 repeatedly cast doubt on the integrity of the polls, in a campaign widely seen as laying the groundwork to contest the results.\n\nThe alleged campaign to contest the election, with force if necessary, had the backing of several key military officers, according to police and judicial officials.\n\nThe court documents released on Thursday name Almir Garnier, the then-head of the navy, as being ready \u201cto put troops on the ground\u201d. They also cite Estevam Theophilo, an army general who was also the target of a search warrant, as being ready to \u201ctake measures to secure the coup\u201d.\n\nFaced with a lack of broader support, however, and after the rapid recognition of Lula as president by key political leaders, Bolsonaro eventually decided to leave Brazil in December 2022. He stayed in Florida for three months while Lula took office in January 2023.\n\nA week after Lula\u2019s inauguration, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters raided and vandalised the country\u2019s supreme court, parliament and presidential palace in Bras\u00edlia, in what the current leftwing administration has sought to portray as in itself an \u201cattempted coup\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for Bolsonaro on Thursday said the rightwing leader would hand over his passport as requested.\n\nThe 68-year-old has denied any wrongdoing, but he faces a growing number of investigations stemming from his time in office.\n\nIn addition to a probe into whether he encouraged the January 8 riots, he faces an investigation into whether he conspired to sell expensive undeclared gifts from overseas dignitaries and another into whether he forged his Covid-19 vaccination certification.\n\nIn the past month, police have also begun investigating whether his administration used the country\u2019s spy agency to illegally monitor the communications of hundreds of politicians, judges and journalists.\n\nBolsonaro has denied wrongdoing in all the cases.\n\nLula on Thursday criticised Bolsonaro\u2019s behaviour.\n\n\u201cBefore the elections, he spent the entire time lying, lying about the ballot boxes [and] creating suspicion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen he didn\u2019t even have the courage to pass me the [ceremonial presidential] sash.

And for that we need to have new frontiers open or at least accessible,\u201d Prates said last week in New York, where he met investors to discuss a new five-year strategic plan.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep the core [business] very safe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We are not doing [a] crazy transition.\u201d\n\nAfter several years of selling off non-core assets in order to focus on its mainstay of deep sea oil and gas production, Petrobras again intends to be a diversified energy group, in line with the wishes of leftwing President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\nSince the return to power of Lula, who previously ruled between 2003 and 2010, it has increased its five-year capital spending budget by 31 per cent, with almost three-quarters dedicated to exploration and production.\n\nIt also plans to return to areas it sought to exit, such as petrochemicals, renewable power and fertilisers, alongside increased investments in refining and biofuels.\n\nPetrobras, which has a market capitalisation of about $110bn, is pursuing oil, natural gas and renewables opportunities abroad again in conjunction with some of its international partners in Brazil including Shell and Equinor, Prates said.\n\nHaving mostly exited operations outside its homeland over the past decade, locations for potential new investment include in Norway, the UK, the Netherlands, west Africa and Guyana, according to Prates.\n\nLast month Petrobras began delivering on its expansion strategy when it acquired exploration rights in three oil blocks operated by Shell in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, a country on the west coast of Africa.\n\nIt also partnered with Shell and China National Offshore Oil Corporation to secure exploration blocks in Brazil in December. Overall, Petrobras plans to spend $7.5bn on exploration over the next five years drilling 50 wells, mostly in Brazilian waters.\n\n\u201cWe want to use these [partnerships] as a buffer for strategic exchanges and experience exchanges but also as an investment together,\u201d said Prates, who criticised the previous management of Petrobras under the government of Jair Bolsonaro for \u201cpulling out of everything\u201d.\n\nHe said Petrobras\u2019s former leadership prioritised \u201csuper profits\u201d and \u201cexceptional dividends\u201d by making everything look nice and selling it.\n\nWith the change of leadership, which followed last year\u2019s return to power of left-winger Lula, the company would get back to replacing oil reserves and growing production, said Prates, a former senator and political ally of the president who also has a background in the energy industry.\n\nHowever, opponents of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party have sounded the alarm. Petrobras was the locus of a sprawling graft scandal during the previous stint of leftwing rule in Brazil, with kickbacks paid in exchange for overcharged construction contracts.\n\nCritics also alleged mismanagement and political interference that cost the business billions of dollars, whether through fuel subsidies or refinery building projects that went over budget.\n\nPrates said addressing investor worries over this history is the \u201cbiggest mission\u201d he faces. Higher standards of corporate governance have been put in place, he said, adding that his experience as a politician and oil executive can help him resist overt political influence, he said.\n\n\u201cI always have good arguments on the other side to say [to politicians], \u2018look this is not a direct administration entity\u2019 \u2014 you have to do that through the board of administration,\u201d Prates said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to say that ever to President Lula, for instance, because he knows that he never, never ever told me anything about, do this, do that.\u201d\n\nInvestors have backed management under Prates. Petrobras shares have surged 60 per cent over the past 12 months to hit and all-time high last week, outperforming ExxonMobil and Chevron.\n\nSchreiner Parker, analyst at Rystad Energy, a consultancy, said: \u201cThere is an idea in the investor community that the troubles of the past have cleared up\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. and that there is much more regulation and oversight that\u2019s occurring in Petrobras.\u201d\n\nRising output from vast offshore reserves known as the \u2018pre-salt\u2019 fields off its southeastern coast is set to propel Brazil into the top-five oil-producing nations towards the end of the decade, according to analysts.\n\nBut the search for new viable deposits to sustain production in the medium-to-long term has disappointed lately and production is due to peak in 2029, according to Marcelo de Assis at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\n\n\u201cThey have a challenge in upstream to replenish reserves and keep the money flowing in future from the most profitable business they have,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the hunt for new deposits, Petrobras has identified a 2,200km marine tract along Brazil\u2019s northern coast called the Equatorial Margin.\n\nHowever, it is appealing a refusal by environmental regulators for a drilling licence to explore a section considered the region\u2019s main prize. Located 500km from the mouth of the Amazon river, campaigners say it is an ecologically sensitive area.\n\nPrates said Petrobras has a duty to the people of Brazil to replenish its oil reserves.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t explore there, you\u2019re going to ask if you run out of oil?

More than half of adults do not have a bank account, according to regulator CNBV.\n\n\u201cThe penetration of financial services in Mexico is way lower than Brazil,\u201d added the Colombian entrepreneur.\n\nThis is down to an issue of supply rather than demand, he argued, taking aim at the country\u2019s entrenched lenders.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] an established oligopoly that has been extremely conservative, doesn\u2019t want to take any risk, and has gotten to believe [it can] blame consumers and not themselves.\u201d\n\nNubank began life as a zero-fee credit card managed by a mobile app and through rapid growth has expanded into a full-service banking offering, with everything from current accounts to investments and insurance. Today it boasts 90mn users, most of whom are in its homeland.\n\nThough still smaller than regional incumbents such as Brazil\u2019s state-owned Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, which has about 150mn clients, the branchless financial technology group says it is adding about 1mn customers a month.\n\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo-based fintech floated in New York at the end of 2021, just before a downturn in valuations in the wider tech sector.\n\nStock in Nu Holdings, as the listed entity is formally known, has increased by more than 80 per cent in the past 12 months, rising just above its initial public offering price of $9.\u00a0Shareholders include SoftBank and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nWith net profit above $300mn in the third quarter, Nubank\u2019s annualised return on equity \u2014 a key profitability metric in banking \u2014 was 21 per cent in the period. \u201cThat really positions us as one of the most profitable financial institutions in Latin America,\u201d said V\u00e9lez.\n\nHowever, the challenger bank will have its work cut out replicating its Brazilian success in Mexico, where a number of industries are dominated by oligopolies and have cautious regulators.\n\nMexico\u2019s slow digitalisation and strong preference for cash has been called a \u201cpuzzle\u201d by one think-tank. In four years since entering, Nu has shot up to being one of Mexico\u2019s largest card issuers by volume and has 5.5mn customers, according to the company.\n\nIts loan book grew a little over 1 per cent in the six months to September and by value its credit card market share is just over 2 per cent, according to regulatory data. \u201cWe tend to pause at times to launch new credit models,\u201d said the chief executive. \u201cOver a longer period of time, you will see us continuing to take significant market share.\u201d\n\nBanking industry insiders say it is hard to make big profits on mass-market credit cards in Mexico due to high default rates and low-value, sporadic use. Card issuers also have to pay back retailers within days, versus 30 days in Brazil.\n\nNu\u2019s default rates in Mexico are higher than the average at its peers, which the company puts down to its large number of first-time card customers. It is offering a 15 per cent annual yield on deposits.\n\n\u201cIf they [Nu] manage to calibrate the additional risks they are taking with the higher profit they can have with this new base of clients, it could work, it\u2019s a question, no one has done it on a big scale before,\u201d said Guillermo Ortiz, ex-governor of Mexico\u2019s central bank and a board member of Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual.Although Nubank\u2019s focus for now is on the three markets where it operates \u2014 Brazil, Mexico and Colombia \u2014 it is also looking at entering new territories in Latin America and beyond, according to V\u00e9lez.\n\nThis could eventually include the US, he added. Nubank recently launched a service allowing its Mexico customers to receive remittances from there.\n\n\u201cIt could be an interesting opportunity, particularly given the high percentage of Latino demographics in the US,\u201d said the executive.\n\nPedro Leduc, analyst at Ita\u00fa BBA, said market expectations for Nu to reach a 30 per cent return on equity in 2024 would make it the most profitable large consumer bank in Latin America.\n\nBut he argued it needed to tailor more services to wealthier segments in Brazil, where it banks every other adult.\n\n\u201cTo keep growing and gain more [market] share, they must start personalising their products to better serve the upper-income client. That\u2019s the big challenge for them in 2024.\u201d\n\nV\u00e9lez said this was already a priority, giving as examples payroll loans for employees and a premium card with cashback.\n\n\u201cBanking in Latin America is a $1tn market cap opportunity,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are poised to be the market leader.\u201d\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/87e13cc7-ce1e-42a4-aeb7-992ad1ca44b9"}}, {"id": "3f215dca-f23d-4b6b-a4e1-96ec3a696fbc", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s supreme court orders probe of anti-corruption group", "blurb": "Action against Transparency International follows moves to unwind legacy of sprawling \u2018Car Wash\u2019 bribery investigation", "date": "2024-02-0500:00:00.0", "body": "A judge on Brazil\u2019s supreme court has ordered an investigation into Transparency International, days after the Berlin-based corruption watchdog criticised the country\u2019s faltering anti-graft efforts and resurging sense of impunity.\n\nThe move is the latest by Justice Dias Toffoli, who in recent months has sought to unwind the legacy of Brazil\u2019s long-running Lava Jato, or Car Wash, anti-corruption investigation, a seven-year-long operation that exposed a culture of bribery.\n\nLast week, Toffoli \u2014 a former lawyer for the ruling Workers\u2019 party \u2014 suspended a multimillion-dollar fine imposed on construction group Novonor, formerly known as Odebrecht, for its role in the bribery scandal.\n\nStarting in 2014, the Car Wash probe revealed a vast kickbacks-for-contracts scheme involving executives at state-controlled energy group Petrobras, a cartel of construction companies and dozens of lawmakers from across the political spectrum.\n\nThe US Treasury department called it the largest foreign bribery case in history. Billions of dollars were eventually recovered and sentences totalling more than 2,200 years were handed down to 165 prominent Brazilians, although only a fraction of those years were served.\n\nSome outcomes from the investigation, however, have been unwound since 2019 following revelations that the presiding judge in the investigation, Sergio Moro, had colluded with prosecutors.\n\nThe supreme court also judged that Moro was biased in his 2017 prosecution of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the leftwing leader who last year returned to the presidency for a third term.\n\nIn addition to the suspension of the Novonor fine, Toffoli last year nullified vast amounts of evidence obtained from the construction company as part of plea deals struck with prosecutors during the Car Wash probe.\n\nHe also suspended a $2bn fine imposed on the holding company of the two brothers who control meatpacking giant JBS. They had also signed a leniency deal under the anti-graft investigation.\n\nThe moves raised concerns among anti-corruption campaigners, including Transparency International, which dropped Brazil by 10 positions in its annual Corruption Perceptions index. The Latin American nation was ranked 104 out of 180 countries.\n\nIn its report last week, the watchdog highlighted the actions of Toffoli as well as the appointment last year of Cristiano Zanin \u2014 Lula\u2019s personal lawyer during the Car Wash investigation \u2014 to the supreme court.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised Lula\u2019s recent appointment of Ricardo Lewandowski as justice minister. While previously serving on the supreme court, Lewandowski was staunchly opposed to the Car Wash operation and had terminated three criminal cases facing the leftwing leader.\n\n\u201cThanks to Toffoli\u2019s decisions, Brazil has become a cemetery for evidence of crimes that generated misery, violence and human suffering in more than a dozen countries in Latin America and Africa,\u201d the non-profit group said. \u201cThe country is increasingly becoming, in the eyes of the world, an example of corruption and impunity.\u201d\n\nToffoli on Monday ordered an investigation of Transparency International over accusations that it misappropriated public resources during the Car Wash probe.\n\nThe judge highlighted that the group was foreign and said any funds received for its anti-corruption work should have been allocated to the national treasury.\n\nTransparency denied any wrongdoing, saying \u201chostile reactions to Transparency International\u2019s anti-corruption work are increasingly serious and common in many parts of the world\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cAttacks on critical voices in society, which denounce the corruption and impunity of powerful people, cannot be normalised.\u201d\n\nEduardo Ribeiro, president of the rightwing Novo party, also criticised the move. \u201cNot satisfied with suspending the billion-dollar fines of companies that confessed their crimes, Toffoli has now ordered an investigation of Transparency International, precisely the NGO that has been warning about these absurd decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this a dictatorship or not?\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/98c31e95-051c-4f53-a674-d1df463d6fdd"}}, {"id": "34e27a7c-4130-49f8-9f5e-e3b7f42c1f63", "event_name": "Hopes rise of a break in Brazil\u2019s IPO drought", "blurb": "Domestic stock market has experienced the longest stretch without a new flotation for at least two decades", "date": "2024-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s stock market is in the throes of its longest stretch without a new flotation for at least two decades.

Our base case is anywhere between three and five IPOs in 2024.\u201d\n\nEven in the context of a global IPO slowdown, the dry spell on S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s B3 exchange stands out.\u00a0Its last stock market debut was in September 2021, putting an abrupt end to a bumper couple of years. 2021 was a high point for listings, with R$65bn raised across 45 transactions.\n\nA key factor was the Brazilian central bank\u2019s (BCB\u2019s) early and aggressive approach to inflation, raising its benchmark lending rate from an all-time low of 2 per cent during the Covid-19 pandemic into the double digits.\n\nHigher borrowing costs then damped a structural shift from fixed income to equities by Brazilian savers. Political uncertainty during the 2022 presidential election also weighed on confidence. Now market predictions are for the base rate to fall below the psychological threshold of 10 per cent this year.\n\nPerhaps a more critical variable for Brazil\u2019s IPO restart is the timing and pace to the anticipated start of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, due to its outsize impact on global capital flows, according to market watchers.\n\nOptimists see other reasons in favour. While Brazilian domestic institutions have pulled back from stocks, strong foreign inflows towards the end of last year helped the local Bovespa index touch an all-time high. Brazilian equities were in the top third of emerging markets in 2023 with a 34 per cent return, versus 10 per cent for the broader FTSE Emerging All Cap index, according to LSEG data.\n\nEven so, analysts say the South American nation\u2019s stocks remain relatively cheap. Excluding oil major Petrobras and miner Vale, Brazilian equities are trading on a 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple of 10 times, below the historical average of 12.3 times, according to BTG Pactual.\n\nMost EM funds are overweight Brazil and positions have increased over the past year, says Pablo Riveroll, head of LatAm equities at Schroders. \u201cMoney from local investors is likely to move back into equities as rates fall, probably accelerating once in single digits,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe market expects that to happen towards the middle of the year so it is probably then that IPO activity accelerates.\u201d\n\nHowever, investors will be mindful of the poor performance of recent floats. Only 14 of the 69 from 2020 and 2021 still trading are in positive territory, according to Nord Research.\u00a0There also remain fiscal concerns, given government pledges of extra spending. The BCB has said orderly public accounts are vital for it to continue reducing rates.\n\nEduardo Figueiredo, head of Brazilian equities at Abrdn, sees potential for IPOs in under-represented sectors such as agriculture, technology, healthcare or infrastructure. He believes investors will be more picky, preferring businesses that are already profitable and generating cash. \u201cDiscipline will be higher this time round as capital is more expensive globally,\u201d he says.\n\nBuyers will want larger issuances to ensure liquidity of shares post-IPO, adds Rafael Oliveira, fund manager at S\u00e3o Paulo-based Kinea. \u201cThis was a significant challenge in many offerings in the 2020-21 cycle.\u201d\n\nIta\u00fa BBA estimates between R$50-R$70bn in proceeds from IPOs and other equity issues in Brazil this year, with between 25 and 35 transactions.\u00a0Among the contenders to go public is subsea oil and gas services provider Oce\u00e2nica Engenharia, which recently notified its intention to float. Follow-on deals in the coming weeks will test market sentiment.\n\nYet with the Bovespa down so far in 2024, net foreign outflows from B3 in January and the Brazilian real slightly lower against the dollar, those on Faria Lima are not getting carried away just yet.\n\n\u201cWe think the second half of the year will be busier for IPOs,\u201d says Marcello Lo Re, head of Latin America\u00a0equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt will be closer to the historical average, excluding 2020 and 2021, which were outliers.\u201d\n\nmichael.pooler@ft.com\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5787e31b-8d5f-4c70-9014-5e9cc2ac45f6"}}, {"id": "2fbd1a46-ee63-4448-9365-4886e47cc41b", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s imports of Russian oil products soar", "blurb": "Bras\u00edlia says surge in purchases of diesel and fuel oil \u2018influenced by multiple factors\u2019 amid ongoing war in Ukraine", "date": "2024-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Brazilian imports of diesel from Russia last year soared 4,600 per cent while purchases of fuel oil rose by almost 400 per cent, in a $8.6bn boost to the Russian economy as the war in Ukraine enters its third year.\n\nBras\u00edlia imported 6.1mn tonnes of diesel from Russia in 2023, a 6,000 per cent increase from the 101,000 tonnes the previous year.

The purchases by Brazil are allowed under the sanctions regime as long as it complies with a detailed set of regulations on issues such as shipping.\n\nOliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, said: \u201cThe first thing going on is just realpolitik.\u00a0Brazil has identified\u00a0an opportunity to obtain Russian commodities\u00a0at a discount and it is not only diesel, but also fertiliser. The same goes for countries\u00a0like India.\n\n\u201c[But] at the same time Brazil is keen to preserve its economic\u00a0and political\u00a0ties with Russia.

He later backtracked and said it would be an issue for the courts to decide.\n\nIn December, Russia accounted for 85 per cent of Brazil\u2019s total diesel imports; the average for 2023 was about 50 per cent.\n\nA top-10 crude producing nation, Brazil relies on diesel imports to fill about 20 per cent of domestic demand. Under Lula, its state-controlled oil major Petrobras is investing to boost refinery capacity.\n\nFelipe Perez, Americas director at S&P Global Commodity Insights, said that, while there might be \u201csome politics\u201d at play, price was the crucial factor driving the diesel imports.\n\n\u201cPeople will try to find the cheapest diesel.\u00a0Everything in Brazil depends on diesel. It is not just transport, but the agribusiness sector too,\u201d he said.\n\nThe price of diesel has long been a sensitive issue in Brazil, which depends on legions of truckers to keep the economy moving. More than 60 per cent of cargo in the continent-sized nation is transported by truck, compared with 32 per cent in the US.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7ebb679e-099e-49ac-a750-73ca46538dee"}}, {"id": "e10c5f9f-ec19-42db-9a91-e66b31f05c09", "event_name": "China\u2019s not so Evergrande", "blurb": "Indebted property group fails to agree restructuring plan with creditors", "date": "2024-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "Binance has bowed to pressure from customers who want to hold their assets with an independent custodian, a Hong Kong court has ordered property giant China Evergrande to be wound up, and Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is returning to an old but controversial playbook to jump-start the country\u2019s economy.\n\nMentioned in this podcast:\n\nBinance bows to trader demands to keep their assets elsewhere\n\nChinese developer Evergrande ordered to be wound up by Hong Kong court\n\nChina Evergrande liquidation to test Hong Kong\u2019s reach\n\nLula\u2019s playbook: Brazil bets on a return to state capitalism\n\nThe FT News Briefing is produced by Fiona Symon, Sonja Hutson, Kasia Broussalian and Marc Filippino.

As the face of a pan-Latin American corruption crackdown, the former judge was revered by the country\u2019s rightwing for confronting a venal political system plagued by a culture of impunity.\n\nBut since the investigation\u2019s peak more than six years ago, Moro\u2019s star has fallen precipitously, his standing battered by the shifting political landscape, revelations of misconduct and a series of ill-judged decisions.\n\nThe man once depicted at rightwing rallies as a barrel-chested superman and seen as a presidential contender now cuts an increasingly isolated figure, with few political allies. In the coming weeks, he faces the potential loss of his Senate seat for alleged campaign financing abuses as well as a Supreme Court investigation into his conduct during the Lava Jato, or car wash, probe.\n\nA conviction in the latter case could bar him from running for office, analysts say, marking an abrupt end to the political career of a man who as a federal judge in 2017 oversaw the conviction and almost two-year incarceration of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the leftwing leader who returned to the presidency for a third term last year.\n\n\u201cIt is important to understand that this is not just about Lula or a politician from one party or the other \u2014 almost all politicians are against Moro,\u201d said Camila Rocha de Oliveira, a political scientist at the Brazilian Center for Analysis and Planning. \u201cHe is also isolated in the legal community, among the courts, so he is in a very bad position.\u201d\n\nMoro defends his innocence and his conduct. He believes the various investigations he is facing are politically motivated \u2014 payback for his role in prosecuting Lula and other politicians during the car wash probe.\n\n\u201c[Lula\u2019s party] has joined forces with opportunistic politicians and is seeking, without legitimate cause, the revocation of my mandate as revenge for the work done during the car wash investigation and also to eliminate a voice from the opposition,\u201d Moro told the Financial Times. \u201cThe Lula government has, as expected, abandoned the fight against corruption.\u201d\n\nMoro, 51, rose to prominence about a decade ago as the judge overseeing the car wash probe from the southern state of Paran\u00e1. The investigation revealed a vast kickbacks-for-contracts scheme involving executives at state-controlled energy group Petrobras, a cartel of construction companies and dozens of lawmakers from across the political spectrum.\n\nThe US Treasury department called it the largest foreign bribery case in history. Billions of dollars were eventually recovered and sentences totalling more than 2,200 years were handed down to 165 prominent Brazilians, although only a fraction of those years was actually served.\n\nIn one of its final acts the investigation ensnared Lula, who had been president between 2003 and 2010, in a legally-fraught graft case that resulted in his imprisonment for almost two years.\n\nAt the height of his popularity, Moro was in 2019 appointed justice minister by hard-right president Jair Bolsonaro and on a pathway to even higher office.\n\nThen things began to fall apart. Leaked messages from his time spearheading the corruption inquiry appeared to show him colluding with prosecutors and sharing information. The Supreme Court ruled that he was biased in his judgment of Lula. The leftwing leader\u2019s conviction was annulled in 2021, initially due to jurisdictional issues, and the case later dropped completely due to time limits.\n\nMoro also fell out of favour with the Brazilian right. Little more than a year into his stint as justice minister, he resigned amid a clash with Bolsonaro over the then-president\u2019s alleged interference in police investigations.\n\nMoro was voted in as senator for Paran\u00e1 in late 2022, but has since been hamstrung by a lack of political allies and divisions within his Brazil Union party. With Lula returning to the presidency in the same elections, his Workers\u2019 party (PT) soon began ratcheting up pressure on Moro.\n\nFew on the left acknowledge the graft uncovered during the car wash investigation and instead blame Moro for the economic costs inflicted by his probe into some of Brazil\u2019s biggest companies. They also claim the probe was a rightwing ploy to seize power.\n\n\u201c[Moro] fuelled the criminalisation of politics and destroyed companies and jobs,\u201d Gleisi Hoffman, president of the PT, said last year. \u201cNow the former judge will have to answer for this.\u201d\n\nA regional electoral court, acting on complaints from the PT as well as Bolsonaro\u2019s Liberal party, will rule next month whether Moro exceeded campaign finance rules while preparing his bid for the Senate. If proven and upheld, Moro could lose his seat and be banned from running for office for eight years.\n\nThe Supreme Court will also hear a case against the former judge, after Justice Dias Toffoli, a former PT lawyer and once a target of the car wash investigation, launched an inquiry into whether Moro had committed fraud as part of plea deals struck during the probe. If convicted, Moro could be banned from politics, analysts say.\n\nThe case follows a separate verdict last year when Toffoli unilaterally nullified vast amounts of evidence obtained during the car wash probe, saying investigators had \u201cdisrespected due legal process and acted with bias\u201d.\n\nPolitical analysts say Moro\u2019s travails are a combination of his own misconduct while he was a judge and his foes\u2019 demand for retribution.\n\n\u201cMoro\u2019s case has a bit of both.\u00a0There is the fact that [during car wash] he took unacceptable actions. But we can also infer a certain degree of retribution. The political winds have changed,\u201d said Bruna Santos, director of the Brazil Institute at the Wilson Center, a US think-tank.\n\nMoro has pledged to fight the cases, but his days in the political limelight look numbered.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wish him bad,\u201d said Liberal party president Valdemar Costa Neto. \u201cBut there is no way out of this.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/212b85b1-53d8-47ce-9c38-6de740dc4aef"}}, {"id": "d9667604-0369-4881-b0af-bb383d482abf", "event_name": "BHP and Vale ordered to pay $9.7bn over Brazilian dam collapse", "blurb": "Disaster at Samarco iron ore mine in 2015 killed 19 people and ranks among country\u2019s worst environmental catastrophes ", "date": "2024-01-2500:00:00.0", "body": "A Brazilian court has ordered iron ore producer Samarco, along with its owners Vale and BHP, to pay R$47.6bn ($9.7bn) in compensation for a dam collapse that triggered one of the country\u2019s worst environmental catastrophes.\n\nThe accident occurred in November 2015 when a structure holding mining waste ruptured near the town of Mariana in Minas Gerais state.\n\nIt unleashed an avalanche of mud that killed 19 people, devastated surrounding villages and contaminated hundreds of kilometres of waterways all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA federal judge on Thursday issued a ruling that held the three companies liable for collective \u201cmoral damages\u201d \u2014 non-material harm such as emotional distress \u2014 suffered by victims of the incident.\n\nThe judgment was handed down in response to a civil action brought by state-level and federal public prosecutors. After the Mariana disaster they had originally filed a lawsuit demanding R$155bn in compensation.\n\nThe companies had been attempting to reach an out-of-court settlement with public authorities, but the efforts hit an impasse after years of wrangling.\n\nSamarco is a venture controlled 50-50 by Brazil\u2019s Vale and Australian group BHP. It restarted operations and the production of iron ore pellets in Brazil at the end of 2020.\n\nVale said it had not been notified of the court decision, but noted that it could be appealed. Its shares were down 2.2 per cent on Thursday evening, giving one of the world\u2019s largest miners a market capitalisation of $62.9bn.\n\nThe Rio de Janeiro-based company said it was maintaining contributions towards the non-profit Renova Foundation. Set up to carry out repairs and provide financial redress under an initial deal in 2016 between the companies and public authorities, Renova has distributed R$34.8bn, according to its website.\n\nBHP said on Friday it had not been served with the court\u2019s ruling and would need to review the decision to assess its implications and the potential for an appeal.\n\nThe Australian group, which disclosed a provision of $3.7bn related to the Samarco dam failure in its annual report, added that it was \u201cfully committed\u201d to supporting the activities of the Renova Foundation.\n\nSamarco declined to comment.\n\nThe Mariana disaster sparked international scrutiny of the mining industry\u2019s safety record, in particular over \u201ctailings\u201d dams that store by-products of mining after the ore is processed.\n\nBHP and Vale face a parallel class-action lawsuit over the event in the UK, with as many as 700,000 claimants. A trial is scheduled for October.\n\nTom Goodhead, chief executive of the law firm Pogust Goodhead, which is bringing the case, said: \u201cThe judgment [in Brazil this week] does not relate to individual claims or compensation, therefore is of little relevance to the claims brought by my clients in England, but is a positive step in holding BHP, Vale and Samarco liable.\u201d\n\nFive years ago, another tailings dam owned by Vale collapsed in the same state near the town of Brumadinho, resulting in 270 fatalities.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1bdeb623-5942-4058-a25d-88aa89f82927"}}, {"id": "fbbe2679-1758-4397-830b-57efb9ed3978", "event_name": "Lula\u2019s playbook: Brazil bets on a return to state capitalism", "blurb": "The president has big plans to kick-start the economy but critics say he is trying to revive a long-discredited strategy", "date": "2024-01-1600:00:00.0", "body": "Beneath the blistering sun, workers in overalls and hard hats are putting the finishing touches to an industrial undertaking that until recently seemed destined to remain uncompleted.\n\nA sprawling mass of smokestacks and pipework, the Abreu e Lima project was originally launched in 2005 by then-president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva as Brazil\u2019s first new oil refinery in decades. It ended up one of the world\u2019s most expensive.\n\nAfter cost estimates ballooned to $20bn \u2014 nine times the initial budget \u2014 the development would be held up by Lula\u2019s critics as a monument to waste, corruption and incompetence during the rule of his Workers\u2019 party, or PT.\n\nCaught up in a political bribery scheme that stole billions from state-controlled oil company Petrobras, its construction was paused in 2014 under Lula\u2019s chosen successor Dilma Rousseff, with only half the planned facility operational.\n\nYet after the 78-year-old Lula began a non-consecutive third term as president last year, activity has resumed to finish the plant, located an hour away from Recife, capital of the northeastern state Pernambuco.\n\nThe refinery expansion falls into a broader public works programme that is one pillar of the veteran left-winger\u2019s plans to kick-start Latin America\u2019s largest economy and drag it out of a prolonged period of mediocrity.\n\nSince returning to power, Lula \u2014 who previously governed between 2003 and 2010 \u2014 has looked to strengthen the role of the state in his bid to lift stagnant living standards in the nation of more than 200mn.\n\nUnder its blueprint for the economy, his administration has boosted welfare payments, relaxed restrictions on public expenditure, promised infrastructure improvements and unveiled a green agenda aimed at attracting foreign capital.\n\n\u201cI want to transform this country into a middle-class country where people can eat well, dress well, live well, relax well, take care of their family,\u201d he said in a weekly online broadcast last month. \u201cThe investments we are making will help Brazil grow.\u201d\n\nHowever, detractors say his more hands-on approach threatens to revive a discredited model of statist development that went wrong in the past.\n\nBrazil rode a global commodities boom fuelled by China in the early 21st century to become an emerging markets darling, before a brutal crash almost a decade ago as prices for raw materials plunged. Opponents said the PT\u2019s overspending and political interference under Rousseff were key factors in the country\u2019s worst recession in a century.\n\nNow, says Kim Kataguiri, an opposition lawmaker, \u201cthe government is repeating its failed recipe of levying more taxes, indebting the country and spending more on areas that benefit the elites more than the poorest.\u201d\n\nOfficials in the year-old administration defend its performance by pointing to positive indicators, such as falling unemployment, inflation and growth. Initial full-year predictions by analysts of GDP growth below 1 per cent in 2023 have been upgraded to nearly 3 per cent ahead of fourth-quarter numbers.\n\nSituated far from international conflict and with abundant natural resources \u2014 from hydrocarbons and minerals to agriculture and renewable energy \u2014 Brazil\u2019s advocates say the country is ideally placed to fulfil its long-vaunted potential.\n\nBut investors and economists remain sceptical of Lula\u2019s state-driven economic game plan. If he is seen to have lost control of the public accounts, they warn it will be difficult for the central bank to continue cutting its base lending rate, which at 11.75 per cent is exerting a drag on activity.\n\n\u201cBrazil just suffered its second lost decade for growth since the 1980s, with per capita income yet to return to its 2013 levels,\u201d says Roberto Secemski, chief Brazil economist at Barclays. \u201cThe country needs higher productivity and capital investments, which would be more viable under lower interest rates. The problem lies in Brazil\u2019s loose fiscal stance.\u201d\n\nWith GDP expansion forecast to cool over the coming year, the president faces a choice: to take a more moderate macroeconomic path \u2014 or to double down on spending in a bid to rekindle growth, at the risk of history repeating itself.\n\n\u201cWe need to improve what didn\u2019t go right before,\u201d says Abinadade Santos, general secretary of the metalworkers\u2019 union in Recife. On the wall in his office is a black-and-white photo of Lula addressing strikes in the 1970s.\n\nSantos has faith the president can deliver, but says there is no room for complacency. \u201cThis is the Lula government\u2019s duty \u2014 to see the mistakes of the past and guarantee it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nPerched on the coast of Brazil\u2019s poor north-east, in a state built on the colonial sugar trade, the Recife metropolitan area was a microcosm of the country\u2019s last boom and bust.\n\nDuring the PT era, thousands of jobs were created by the refinery and the nearby Atl\u00e2ntico Sul shipyard, which opened in 2008 and was billed as the largest in the southern hemisphere.\n\nIt was part of a signature Lula industrial policy aimed at resurrecting the national shipbuilding industry with orders of tankers and rigs by Petrobras.\n\nBut then, in 2014 a nationwide investigation uncovered a kickbacks-for-contracts scam centred on the oil giant, leading to the imprisonment of dozens of politicians and businessmen. Lula himself served time for a corruption conviction that was later overturned.\n\nTogether with the scandal, a drop in crude prices led Petrobras to cancel a number of vessel purchases, dealing a heavy blow to domestic shipyards already plagued by budget overruns, delayed deliveries and financial problems.\n\nMass lay-offs at the Suape port and industrial complex, the vast site home to the refinery and shipyard, reverberated across the local economy.\n\n\u201cThere was a chorus of denunciations and a whole dismantlement of what had been thought of as a very promising future for the region,\u201d says Ecio Costa, a professor of economics at the Federal University of Pernambuco.\n\nThe ensuing national turmoil helped force Rousseff\u2019s removal from office by impeachment in 2016 and tainted the legacy of Lula, a former trade unionist born in Pernambuco before moving to S\u00e3o Paulo as a child.\n\nDuring his first stint in office, he won acclaim for lifting 20mn citizens out of poverty in one of the world\u2019s most unequal societies through social benefits. \u201cWhen Lula was president, it was one of the best times here in Pernambuco \u2014 and perhaps in the whole of Brazil,\u201d says John Bezerra da Silva, who worked as a welder at both the shipyard and refinery but now drives a taxi for a living.\n\nThe 34-year-old wants to return to his trade. \u201cPeople here have a lot of hope that the refinery and shipbuilding will really come back.\u201d\n\nThese dreams may yet be realised. Now headed by a Lula ally, Petrobras plans to place orders again with domestic shipyards as it embarks on a massive ramp-up of offshore production forecast to catapult Brazil into the top tier of crude producers.\n\nBut to succeed, the industry will have to overcome factors that previously left it struggling to be competitive and meet deadlines.\n\nCosta argues the government should concentrate on improving the conditions for private enterprise as a whole to thrive: \u201cTo have rapid development, you need an environment that is more accommodating to business and investments.\u201d\n\nThis will involve tackling deep structural issues like red tape, poor logistics infrastructure, skills shortages and unwieldy state bureaucracy. Together these factors contribute to what is known as the custo Brasil \u2014 the elevated cost of doing business in the country.\n\nThe recent passage of a constitutional amendment to simplify the country\u2019s complex tax system was broadly welcomed as a step in the right direction, with S&P upgrading Brazil\u2019s sovereign rating one notch, though it is still below investment grade.\n\nIt followed other market-friendly reforms by preceding rightwing governments, including overhauls of the rigid labour code and pensions provision. Under Lula\u2019s far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, ministers pursued privatisation and smaller government.\n\nBut the challenge is stark. Brazil\u2019s productivity \u2014 the output per hour worked, crucial to raising a nation\u2019s prosperity \u2014 grew by just 0.5 per cent annually in the four decades to 2022, according to the Get\u00falio Vargas Institute.\n\nCarla Argenta, chief economist at CM Capital, says Brazil is likely to benefit in the short term from monetary easing internationally. \u201cBut the country\u2019s limited ability to create internal drivers for activity is expected to keep GDP growing at modest rates,\u201d she adds. The economy expanded by an annual rate of just 0.5 per cent on average in the past decade.\n\nIn its quest to spur growth, the Lula administration has turned to an old formula.\n\nUnveiled to fanfare in August, the government\u2019s new public works programme \u2014 the Growth Acceleration Programme, or PAC \u2014 reprised the name of two previous initiatives with chequered records.\n\nUnder PAC 1, launched by Lula in 2007, only a quarter of projects were effectively delivered, according to analysis by consultancy Inter B. For PAC 2, rolled out three years later under Rousseff, the figure rose to 36 per cent.\n\nOfficials, however, insist the latest iteration is different. It has a priority to complete unfinished projects and will have greater private sector involvement through concessions and partnerships.\n\n\u201cIt is a planning tool that worked in the past, even though there were critics of specific projects,\u201d says Guilherme Mello, a senior official in the finance ministry.\n\nOf the R$1.4tn ($290bn) of investments targeted by 2026, there is to be $76bn of federal funding. The rest is expected to come from bank financing, private players and state-owned enterprises like Petrobras.\n\nAnother key focus is promoting ventures that combat global warming. Bras\u00edlia hopes to seize on international goodwill from the clampdown on Amazon deforestation.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about a new industrialisation. We are not planning on getting back the industry of the \u201870s or \u201880s. We need a new industry\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that is combined with the green transformation,\u201d adds Mello.\n\nThe strategy aims to reverse a so-called \u201cpremature\u201d deindustrialisation, and Lula supporters say the early signs are encouraging.\n\nChinese automaker BYD last year announced it will begin producing electric cars in northeastern Brazil as part of a R$3bn investment. The company\u2019s local chair Alexandre Baldy says the decision was down to Lula\u2019s commitment to decarbonisation and his meeting with the company\u2019s founder on a trip to China. \u201cThe government\u2019s economic plan is very positive,\u201d says Baldy.\n\nBYD\u2019s arrival shows the nation\u2019s natural resources can be turned into \u201ccutting-edge industry\u201d, according to the executive. \u201cSo that we stop thinking of Brazil as the country of the future and invest in Brazil to be the country of the present.\u201d\n\nTo aid domestic production, the government is charging tariffs on imported EVs. However, some mainstream economists are wary of protectionism and corporate handouts, arguing that insulation from overseas rivals historically often led to a lack of competitiveness in Brazilian manufacturing, such as automotive.\n\n\u201cSubsidies and incentives to sectors tend to last longer than imagined with a smaller impact than expected,\u201d says Gustavo Arruda, an economist at BNP Paribas.\n\nAnd there is little room for manoeuvre in Brazil\u2019s federal budget, since some 90 per cent of it is earmarked for non-discretionary items like social security and pensions.\n\nThe administration intends to fund extra spending with increased revenue collection. Finance minister Fernando Haddad has said the intention is to end exemptions, loopholes and avoidance, rather than increase the country\u2019s already elevated overall tax burden.\n\nBesides misgivings over whether this is realistic, the worry in corporate circles is of an uptick in borrowing levels. Public debt, currently at 74 per cent of GDP, is relatively high for an emerging economy. Sceptics warn of potential knock-on effects for inflation and investor confidence.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are not expecting [the fiscal situation] to trigger a crisis, increasing indebtedness will continue to expose Brazil\u2019s fragilities,\u201d says Arruda. \u201cThe need for fiscal adjustment in the future could curb investments from the private sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most critical issue in every long-term or even short-term investor\u2019s mind [is] fiscal stability,\u201d says Paulo Bilyk, chief executive of asset manager Rio Bravo Investimentos.\u00a0\u201cEverybody will have to keep an eye out on sins of the past that are trying to be repeated.\u201d\n\nFollowing Rousseff\u2019s impeachment, a constitutional amendment was passed that restricted growth in the budget to inflation. Investors considered it the cornerstone of fiscal credibility.\n\nSince Lula\u2019s return it has been replaced with a looser set of rules that, while imposing certain limits, requires expenditure to increase in real terms. The new framework also promises gradually rising primary budget surpluses \u2014 ie, before interest payments \u2014 after balancing the books in 2024.\n\nWhile this year\u2019s zero-deficit target is defended by Haddad, Lula has suggested it may not be achieved. He is facing pressure from his own party to spend more ahead of important municipal elections in October.\n\nSimone Tebet, Brazil\u2019s planning minister, defends the new fiscal framework as \u201csustainable\u201d and says federal investment as a proportion of GDP remains \u201cmuch below the world average. So there\u2019s no reason to speak about excess or inefficiency in public spending\u201d.\n\nWhile Lula says his previous stint in office is evidence of his fiscal bona fides \u2014 his first four-year term is recognised for largely sticking to economic orthodoxy \u2014 critics accuse him of later starting a more expansionary phase embraced by Rousseff.\n\nAnd though a powerful Congress dominated by conservatives could resist any radical turns, investor doubts linger.\n\nLula\u2019s vision of reviving old-school heavy industries while stimulating innovative new sectors will be tested at the Suape port complex.\n\nThe Petrobras refinery\u2019s general manager, Marcio Maia, says its expansion will double processing capacity, helping reduce reliance on diesel imports. \u201cIt is very important for Petrobras and for Brazil.\u201d\n\nYet like other states in the windswept and sunny north-east, Pernambuco is also touted as a potential hub for green hydrogen (H2) \u2014 a clean fuel produced from renewable electricity.\n\nState governor Raquel Lyra, from a centre-right party, describes this as a \u201cnew cycle of development\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have an extraordinary window of opportunity,\u201d she says. \u201cGreen H2 could be exported to Europe, which is in crisis because of the Ukraine war.\u201d\n\nFrench renewable energy group Qair is planning a R$21bn green H2 project at the port, but local executive Gustavo Silva says the sector needs regulation and incentives. Draft legislation is before Congress.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to create subsidies for this market,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe will be competing with other countries that offer highly competitive scenarios.\u201d\n\nThe Atl\u00e2ntico Sul shipyard was mothballed in 2019 and later entered bankruptcy protection.

It also operates as a giant basin to collect and distribute water resources across the continent.\n\nThe biome\u2019s diverse mix of trees, shrubs, roots and grasslands has been increasingly under threat from the advance of agriculture, particularly soyabean and cotton farming, which has boomed in the past 30 years.\n\nA record more than 7,800 sq km of the Cerrado were razed last year, a 43 per cent increase from the previous year, government data showed. In November alone, more than 570 sq km of land was cleared, an area three times larger than in the same month the previous year.\n\nThe figures will be a blow to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who since taking office last January has put environmental protection at the heart of his political agenda and has directed more resources to the agencies that maintain Brazil\u2019s diverse ecosystems. The Amazon city of Bel\u00e9m will play host to the key UN COP30 climate summit in 2025.\n\nIn the Amazon rainforest, the approach appears to be working, with deforestation in the Brazilian section of the biome last year falling 50 per cent from the previous year. That has been largely achieved through tougher enforcement against the rainforest\u2019s many criminal interests, including illegal loggers, ranchers and wildcat gold miners.\n\nLula wants to reduce deforestation in Brazil to zero by 2030, but that goal is at risk from the rising clearances in the Cerrado.\n\n\u201cLula\u2019s sacrifice of the Cerrado to beef and soy production is a major stain on his environmental credentials, and needs to be reversed and rectified urgently,\u201d said Alex Wijeratna, senior director at campaign group Mighty Earth.\n\n\u201cThe Cerrado savannah is being massively overlooked in Brazil and by the global community.\u201d\n\nThe situation is complicated by environmental rules. In the Amazon, landowners are required to maintain 80 per cent of the vegetation on their land, while 20 per cent of the land can be used for commercial purposes.\n\nBut in the Cerrado, which dominates swaths of central Brazil, only 20 per cent of vegetation must typically be preserved. These looser regulations, combined with developments in farming techniques enabling crops to flourish in the climate, have propelled the advance of agriculture.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, the suppression of native vegetation is allowed by the forest code. So, unlike the Amazon where prevention can be done via law enforcement, in the Cerrado incentives have to be created for landowners to give up their right to deforest,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Guimar\u00e3es, executive director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute.\n\nThe Cerrado has lost 12 per cent of its native vegetation over the past 20 years, according to government data. In November the Lula administration launched a four-year plan to reduce the destruction of the biome, with initiatives focused on government supervision and expanding protected areas.\n\nSome environmentalists say the agricultural sector risks its own future by replacing vegetation with cropland, since this undermines the process of evapotranspiration, in which water evaporates into the atmosphere from soil. This leads to a reduction in rainfall, which can imperil harvests.\n\nGabriel Hofmann, a researcher at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, said: \u201cIf there is a lack of water in the Cerrado, this will have strong repercussions on other regions of Brazil, both for the supply of water to the population and for the production of hydropower, the main form of electricity production.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9 Lima, secretary for deforestation control at the environment ministry, said reducing the destruction of the Cerrado would be its \u201ctop priority\u201d and \u201cbiggest challenge\u201d this year.\n\n\u201cLegal deforestation is much more difficult to control because the law allows it. There is no way to punish what the law authorises.\u201d\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3156a1f8-8b9e-4ae3-b77c-53d293d72f4c"}}, {"id": "c090bdd8-fa26-43e6-ac0f-610a9d575aa7", "event_name": "Chinese carmaker BYD held talks with lithium producer in Brazil", "blurb": "Group is hunting for lithium assets in the country with aim of assembling an integrated supply chain", "date": "2024-01-1400:00:00.0", "body": "Chinese electric-car maker BYD has held talks about a potential takeover of a lithium producer in Brazil, in the global rush to secure raw materials for the EV revolution.\n\nBYD\u2019s chair in the South American nation, Alexandre Baldy, said discussions had taken place with $2.9bn-valued Sigma Lithium over a possible supply agreement, joint venture or acquisition.\n\nSigma began shipping the silvery-white metal \u2014 a key element for EV batteries \u2014 from its hard rock mine and processing plant in the state of Minas Gerais last year.\n\nBYD is backed by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway and recently overtook Tesla as the world\u2019s largest EV manufacturer.\n\nIt is building its first electric car factory outside Asia in Brazil as part of a R$3bn ($620mn) investment.\n\nAs BYD hunts for lithium assets in the country with the goal of assembling an integrated supply chain, Baldy said there was an \u201cactive\u201d dialogue with Sigma, which is listed in Toronto and on Nasdaq.\n\n\u201cDifferent strands are being discussed about supply, a joint venture, an acquisition\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009nothing is concrete,\u201d he added.\n\nBaldy said BYD had met Sigma\u2019s chief executive Ana Cabral Gardner in S\u00e3o Paulo last month, but declined to give more details about the talks, citing a confidentiality agreement.

Some within his conservative movement have claimed there was infiltration by leftwing activists.\n\n\u201cThis has never been the behaviour of people on our side, people on the right wing,\u201d Bolsonaro told CNN Brasil. He described custodial sentences of up to 17 years given to those already found guilty as \u201cabsurd\u201d.\n\nThe disturbances carried echoes of the Capitol invasion in Washington DC almost exactly two years earlier by supporters of former US president Donald Trump, who was idolised by Bolsonaro and made allegations of electoral fraud in the wake of his own defeat.\n\nIn Bras\u00edlia on January 8 2023, thousands of rightwing protesters clad in the national colours of yellow and green invaded the supreme court, presidential palace and Congress, alleging without proof that Lula\u2019s election was rigged and calling for the armed forces to overturn the result.\n\nThe disturbances occurred a week after the left winger\u2019s inauguration for a third non-consecutive term, following his narrow victory over Bolsonaro in a highly polarised presidential race.\n\nTelevision footage of violent trespass and property damage inside official premises grabbed international attention. Law enforcement agents quickly quelled the riots, which Lula called an \u201ccoup attempt\u201d, with more than a thousand suspects arrested in the aftermath.\n\nA cabinet minister in charge of security was later forced to resign, after CCTV footage showed him greeting intruders inside the presidential palace.\n\nThirty people have been convicted of crimes related to the episode, with another 170-odd judgments expected in the coming months. Police on Monday morning executed 46 search and seizure warrants and one arrest as part of an operation to find financiers of the criminal acts.\n\nAn official ceremony was due to take place on Monday afternoon in Bras\u00edlia to commemorate the events, with speeches expected from Lula and supreme court justices.\n\nDespite the restoration of institutional stability by Lula\u2019s government following the riots, political polarisation has not gone away, according to Marina Pontes at the consultancy Prospectiva.\n\n\u201cThe commemoration of the events perpetuates this situation, a fact contrary to the government of unity that Lula wanted in 2023,\u201d she said, adding that the Lula-versus-Bolsonaro dynamic would probably continue to be played out in municipal elections later this year.\n\nThe centre-left politician remains a divisive figure.

Its average projection is for 3mn cases this year.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o, a naturally occurring warming of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, is believed by many scientists to be driving increasingly severe weather patterns worldwide. Some meteorologists say its effects are being exacerbated by climate change.\n\nIn Brazil, the current El Ni\u00f1o pattern has been linked to a record heatwave, extreme drought in the Amazon rainforest and prolonged heavy rains and flooding in the country\u2019s south.\n\nThese conditions have enabled increased transmission of mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, chikungunya and zika, which was linked to a surge in microcephaly cases \u2014 babies born with a very small head \u2014 in Brazil in 2015-16.\n\n\u201cThe mosquito depends on heat, it grows more with heat and rain. So as long as the temperature is kept higher for a long time, the replication of the mosquito and, consequently, the virus is facilitated,\u201d said Ester Sabino, professor at the Institute of Tropical Medicine at S\u00e3o Paulo university.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having higher temperatures for longer and this means that transmission occurs for a longer period of time during the year. We will probably see an increase in chikungunya cases, too.\u201d\n\nA potentially fatal disease, dengue can cause high fever, muscle pain and internal bleeding. It is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which thrives in pools of stagnant water. Chikungunya is spread by the same mosquito type and provokes similar symptoms to dengue but is caused by a different virus.\n\nThe number of reported dengue cases in Brazil rose 16 per cent in 2023 compared with the previous year. This year, the health ministry has warned of an \u201cepidemic level\u201d of cases in Brazil\u2019s central-west region as well as a \u201cpotential epidemic\u201d in the south-east.\n\nThe virus has four serotypes \u2014 or variations \u2014 and infection by one does not create immunity for the others. Brazilian health officials are particularly concerned this year because of the re-emergence of the third serotype known as DENV-3.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a long time we have four serotypes circulating in Brazil,\u201d said Maciel. \u201cSerotype three had not been present since 2007, so we will have many susceptible people.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization last month described dengue fever as a \u201csubstantial public health challenge\u201d, noting a \u201c10-fold surge in reported cases worldwide increasing from 500,000 to 5.2mn\u201d between 2000 and 2019.\n\nThe health body reported more than 5mn dengue cases worldwide last year. It said Brazil accounted for more than 2.9mn of the global total, according to its own data for suspected cases.\n\nSabino said the country\u2019s overweighting in the number of suspected cases was probably due to Brazil\u2019s stricter standards of notification.\n\nThe health ministry last month rolled out a dengue vaccine, but supply has been restricted to priority regions due to manufacturing bottlenecks.\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2f3b9b80-7b9a-42d4-bf7f-ea8492a8da24"}}, {"id": "2db1f42c-9943-4860-9cf7-cf97a79f4474", "event_name": "S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s historic centre has fallen into crime-ridden decay.

Here the discussion was about whether to buy batons to defend against home invasions or whether to pay the local gang [protection money] or not,\u201d said the architect. \u201cI was horrified.\u201d\n\nThe largest city in the Americas, S\u00e3o Paulo is a financial, commercial and cultural hub that draws immigrants from across the region. Its rich history, dating back to the mid-16th century, saturates the city centre; a mix of neoclassical, gothic revival and modernist landmarks evoke the various architectural phases \u2014 and periodic economic booms \u2014 that have washed over the metropolis of 11.5mn.\n\nBut the historical centre, known as Centro, has been in a long period of decline. A plan to devote some of the city\u2019s $6.2bn cash pile to revitalising the troubled area has left residents hoping it can emulate city centres like that of New York in the previous century, returning from a period of decay, poverty and crime to prosperity and at least relative safety.\n\nThat would require reversing the economic trend of 30 years. Drawn by tax breaks and looser regulations, new construction works in the city have over three decades gradually shifted west and then south, moving the economic heart of S\u00e3o Paulo from Centro to areas such as Faria Lima, today Brazil\u2019s equivalent of Wall Street.\n\nAbsent an economic motor, large parts of Centro have decayed. Thousands of properties, including historic buildings, have been abandoned or taken over illegally by so-called occupations. Homelessness is ubiquitous and crime has soared.\n\nIn the first nine months of this year, more than 16,500 robberies and muggings were reported in the area \u2014 the highest level in 22 years and an average of about 60 a day, according to police. A further 40,000 incidents of pickpocketing were reported.\n\nFor some urbanists, the decay recalls Manhattan in the mid-20th century, when suburban flight and deindustrialisation hollowed out parts of the island and crime soared.\n\n\u201cNew York recovered from the decay in the 1970s\u2009[thanks to] partnerships between public authorities, the private sector and civil society,\u201d said Philip Yang, founder of the Institute of Urbanism and Studies for the Metropolis.\n\nBut he cautioned that S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s path would be even more difficult because \u201clevels of poverty in a megacity of the global south are much higher\u201d.\n\nThe most stark example of Centro\u2019s problems is an area known as Cracol\u00e2ndia \u2014 literally Crackland \u2014 which hosts a roving mass of people engaged in open-air drug dealing and use. Once a commercial hub and home to a mix of economic classes, the neighbourhood is today largely seen as off-limits by other residents of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t come here any more. No one comes to Centro,\u201d said the owner of a hardware store near Cracol\u00e2ndia, who declined to be named out of concern for their personal safety. \u201cPeople talk about respecting the human rights of the drug addicts, but what about our right to be able to come and go?\u201d\n\nThe comments were echoed by Valdevino Pereira, who was shining shoes at the foot of the beaux-arts Martinelli building, the tallest building in Latin America when it opened in 1929.\n\n\u201cThe clients are no longer coming. The criminals target elderly people on the street because they know they can\u2019t escape easily,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to revitalise the area.\u201d\n\nRevitalisation is an issue that has hung over city hall throughout successive governments, with multiple mayors \u2014 from both left and right \u2014 trying and failing to reverse the decay.\n\nLike his predecessors, the current mayor, Ricardo Nunes, has a plan. Unlike them, however, he has resources to back it up. Following a pension reform in 2017, and years of privatisations and austerity budgets during the past decade, city hall is reported to be sitting on a cash pile of about R$30bn (US$6.2bn).\n\nOfficials have rolled out a package of subsidies, tax incentives and reductions in planning fees to encourage investment and building works in Centro. They have also increased the police presence and improved lighting and sanitation services.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to attract 200,000 new people to live in Centro in the next 10 years,\u201d said Fabr\u00edcio Cobra, chief secretary at city hall\u2019s executive office.\n\nThis would be an increase of almost 50 per cent on the area\u2019s estimated current population of 400,000.\n\n\u201cThe mayor himself justifies these benefits as recompense for everything the city did to Centro in the past. What it once took away from the region, it now has to return through benefits,\u201d Cobra added.\n\nMost prominent among the city\u2019s plans is a R$1bn subsidy package for companies that renovate old or abandoned buildings. Cobra \u2014 who says 14 such projects have already been approved, with 20 more under consideration \u2014 hopes residents will opt to live in these refurbished buildings rather than commute long distances from S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s sprawling suburbs. The total metro area has a population of more than 22mn.\n\nBut critics say such investments will do nothing for Centro\u2019s most deprived residents, for whom modern residences are far beyond their economic reach.\n\n\u201cThe most important point is the issue of people living on the streets,\u201d said D\u00e9bora Lima, a co-ordinator of the activist Homeless Workers\u2019 Movement. \u201cThe city hall has a plan to serve 3,000, but the issue involves 53,000 families [living rough in S\u00e3o Paulo].\u201d\n\nPaiva, the architect, agreed, saying it would be impossible to revitalise the centre without first addressing deep social problems such as ubiquitous homelessness and drug use. Experts say that requires co-ordination between politicians, law enforcement and social and healthcare workers. Solutions must be tailored to individuals in need of help, Paiva added.\n\nCobra said city hall viewed the drug problem as a public health issue that required healthcare solutions, while police would focus on tackling the networks behind narcotics trafficking.\n\nSome in Centro want law enforcement to take a firmer line.\n\n\u201cGood people can\u2019t defend themselves any more,\u201d said another small business owner near Cracol\u00e2ndia. \u201cYou have to follow the law. Taking drugs on the streets is illegal, so they should take the addicts away.\u201d\n\nYet Cracol\u00e2ndia defies easy solutions. When police clear large encampments, users simply filter into other parts of the city, stoking complaints from residents there.\n\nTwo large public plazas near Cracol\u00e2ndia have been cordoned off to prevent homeless people from camping. In the once bustling neighbourhood of Santa Ifig\u00eania, lit crack pipes are common.\n\nThe juxtapositions in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s historical centre are best captured by the J\u00falio Prestes train station, an imposing neoclassical edifice that opened in 1938 with money from Brazil\u2019s coffee boom and has since been renovated. It is now home to one of the country\u2019s top classical music venues.\n\nBut attendees must enter concerts using a rear or underground entrance; the venue closes its main door at 6pm because the streets outside are occupied by drug users.\n\n\u201cThe city centre has continued to decay in spite of this cultural district,\u201d said Yang, the urbanist.\n\n\u201cThe same way that Paris or many European cities are cities of the 18th and 19th centuries, S\u00e3o Paulo is a city of the 20th century,\u201d making it vital to revive the historic area, he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t recover the centre, we will be lost in terms of who we are as paulistanos.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d7d68afb-eb79-40a0-ade0-17d069649fd6"}}, {"id": "07af136c-2593-49e9-a9ee-9a8c938d2ea3", "event_name": "Brazil to launch regulated carbon market", "blurb": "Activists worry that a carve-out for agriculture will limit the scheme\u2019s environmental value", "date": "2023-12-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil plans to launch a regulated carbon market with the aim of combating climate change, as Latin America\u2019s largest economy looks to reclaim its credentials as a leader on the environment.\n\nLawmakers in Bras\u00edlia are advancing a bill that would establish a \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system, in which projects that would reduce or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere \u2014 such as tree planting \u2014 would sell tradeable permits for companies to cover emissions. Each represents a tonne of CO\u2082 or equivalent.\n\nThe objective is to push polluters to decrease greenhouse gas emissions over time, in line with national goals, or else buy these permits, known as credits or offsets.\n\nThe initiative is part of the green agenda of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva who, since assuming power at the start of 2023, has won international plaudits for a clampdown on destruction of the Amazon rainforest, following a rise under his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nBut green campaigners caution that the bill exempts livestock and primary agriculture \u2014 unprocessed goods directly from farms \u2014 which are together one of the country\u2019s main sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs).\n\nLula\u2019s leftwing administration has already faced censure from activists over plans to boost oil and gas production as his government walks a tightrope between environmentalism and economic development.\n\nSimilar emissions-trading schemes, or ETS, operate in the EU, China and California, though with a focus on emissions allowances rather than offsets. The idea is for market forces to set a carbon price and spur clean innovation. Brazilian officials also hope it will attract foreign investment.\n\nAfter initial votes in both the lower house and the senate, the bill needs secondary approval from both chambers, before it can be signed into law by Lula.\n\nThe International Chamber of Commerce in Brazil said that, in an optimistic scenario, the country could receive revenues of $120bn by 2030 from regulated and voluntary carbon markets.\n\nPedro Venzon, policy adviser at the Geneva-based International Emissions Trading Association, said Brazil had the potential to be \u201cone of the most important domestic carbon markets in the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf Brazil manages to develop an efficient system with high integrity, this can set the tone for other countries like Indonesia and India,\u201d he added. \u201cThis could create a new momentum for carbon markets, especially [in] the global south.\u201d\n\nBut excluding agriculture may limit the environmental impact, critics said. Brazil is the world\u2019s seventh-largest emitter of CO\u2082 equivalents, accounting for 3 per cent of global emissions, according to Climate Watch data for 2020. About half its emissions are from deforestation, some of which is carried out for farming purposes and much of which is illegal. This releases carbon stored in trees and plants.\n\nA quarter of emissions come from agriculture and livestock, according to the chamber of deputies. Scientists say contributors are land clearances, methane from cattle, and nitrogen fertilisers. \u201cThe regulated market is very important to advance solutions with the best cost benefit,\u201d said Tasso Azevedo, co-ordinator at the non-profit MapBiomas.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t include [agriculture], we will create a weak market that deals with a very small portion of emissions.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s farming lobby \u2014 among the top exporters of soyabeans, beef, cotton and corn \u2014 justifies its exclusion on the grounds that it is difficult to measure agricultural emissions. Activities such as food-processing plants and meatpackers would be covered by the rules.\n\nFarmers in the continent-sized country say they already preserve large tracts of native vegetation and are expected to be significant suppliers of credits.\n\n\u201cThe primary Brazilian agricultural sector within the [farm] gate is the main national asset for offsetting greenhouse gas emissions from other polluting sectors,\u201d said Pedro Lupion, leader of the parliamentary agricultural caucus.\n\n\u201cNo country in the world has [carbon] regulation of the agricultural sector due to a lack of scientifically verifiable references and metrics, in addition to increasing the price of food with taxes and other implementation fees.\u201d\n\nBut environmentalists argue no other carbon market exempts the main sources of GHGs. New Zealand is expected to impose a world-first levy on methane from cows and sheep by 2030.\n\n\u201cWe are excluding a big chunk of emissions that could be reduced,\u201d said Bruna Araujo at sustainability consultancy WayCarbon. \u201cThere is also the issue of a proper methodology to measure agribusiness emissions.\u201d\n\nThe planned rules will impose reporting requirements on companies or installations emitting above 10,000 tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent annually. Those with emissions of more than 25,000 tonnes will be subject to compliance obligations.\n\nThe text\u2019s rapporteur in the lower house, federal deputy Aliel Machado of the Green Party, has suggested a longer transition period for the agricultural sector.\n\n\u201cThe political strength that agriculture has within the national congress [means] if it decides not to get on board, we will struggle to approve a law that includes it,\u201d he told the Financial Times. \u201cI believe that if agriculture doesn\u2019t enter into this law now, it will do so soon.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a7b017a-c54e-48e8-8c86-0654ed63979b"}}, {"id": "ce459eaf-ebea-4dbc-bba1-4a7bdf8639eb", "event_name": "Brazil environment minister demands \u2018ceiling\u2019 on oil production", "blurb": "Comments contrast with government plan to become major crude exporter by 2029", "date": "2023-12-2600:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil must consider capping oil production and exploration, the country\u2019s environment minister has said, casting her in opposition to the government\u2019s own plans of turning the nation into one of the biggest crude producers by 2029.\n\n\u201cOne issue that will have to be faced is the issue of limits, a ceiling for oil exploration. It is a debate that is not easy but that oil-producing countries will have to face,\u201d Marina Silva told the Financial Times.\n\nHer comments reflect a tension in President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s efforts to play both sides of the climate debate \u2014 burnishing Brazil\u2019s environmental credentials in protecting the crucial ecology of the Amazon, while supporting oil drilling for its economic benefits. The energy ministry has set a goal of increasing output from 3mn barrels a day last year to 5.4mn by the end of the decade.\n\nBorn in the Amazon rainforest and raised by impoverished rubber tappers, the 65-year-old Silva is today among the world\u2019s most respected environmentalists. Her appointment as minister earlier this year by President Lula was hailed as a symbol of Brazil\u2019s commitment to ecological protection and the green transition.\n\nBut her mission faces obstacles even within the leftwing administration, notably from the energy ministry and state-controlled Petrobras, which are both hoping to harness new giant offshore fields to increase crude output.\n\nThe energy plan would make Brazil the world\u2019s fourth-largest producer, ahead of Iran, Canada and Kuwait. Earlier this month, the country joined the Opec+ group \u2014 which comprises the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus its allies \u2014 although Lula has insisted its status will remain that of an observer.\n\n\u201cBrazil is an oil producer. This is a debate that will have to be had, even in the context of wars. We are committed to the goal of tripling renewable energy. But all this cannot be done if we do not discuss the issue of limits to exploration,\u201d Silva said.\n\nAlexandre Silveira, Brazil\u2019s energy minister, told the Financial Times that he saw \u201cno contradiction\u201d between the country\u2019s oil and gas targets and its aspiration to lead the world\u2019s transition to green energy. He said oil revenues would help finance the shift.\n\nBrasilia\u2019s focus on fossil fuels, however, has prompted scepticism internationally, especially as Lula regularly asks western nations to shoulder a larger financial burden to protect the Amazon rainforest and the global environment.\n\n\u201cBrazil said one thing, but did another at the COP28 summit [in Dubai]. It is unacceptable that the same country, which claims to defend the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, is announcing its alignment with the group of the largest oil exporters in the world,\u201d said Leandro Ramos of Greenpeace Brasil.\n\nEnvironment minister Silva added: \u201cWe cannot give up on the energy transition. Energy security is necessary, but we also must think about transition. Both things must happen.\u201d\n\nLula has said that Brazil\u2019s involvement in Opec+ would be focused on convincing wealthy oil nations to invest in alternatives.\n\nIn the first nine months of this year, his government has succeeded in reducing illegal deforestation in the Amazon by about 50 per cent compared with the same period last year. The growing destruction of the rainforest under the previous Jair Bolsonaro administration had sparked international censure.\n\nSilva said, however, that she would not claim victory.\n\n\u201cWe have sectoral goals. It\u2019s not just deforestation. It is also energy, industry, transport, land use and agriculture. All these have CO\u2082 reduction targets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot be resigned to results already achieved because no matter how good they are, they will need to be improved.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a1745ef-39f2-45ad-a5ef-d89b96d039db"}}, {"id": "64524ed3-5714-43a4-9325-86f70b2a5560", "event_name": "Brazil passes long-awaited tax reform ", "blurb": "Constitutional amendment will simplify one of world\u2019s most complex regimes", "date": "2023-12-1600:00:00.0", "body": "Lawmakers in Brazil have voted to overhaul the nation\u2019s byzantine tax system, which has frequently been cited as a barrier to doing business in Latin America\u2019s largest economy.\n\nAfter years of planning and delays, the lower house of Congress on Friday backed the landmark constitutional amendment that will simplify a host of levies on goods and services.\n\nMultinational corporations had long complained that Brazil\u2019s labyrinthine tax rules are costly to fulfill, full of legal uncertainty and an impediment to investing.\n\nThe legislation will replace five separate consumption taxes with a dual VAT system \u2014 one charged by federal authorities, and the other at a regional level. It will be phased in over eight years starting in 2026. Central parts of the proposal were designed in the previous rightwing Jair Bolsonaro administration.\n\nThe passage of the reform was met with broad support.\n\n\u201cWith this reform we will have a modern tax system. It is a huge step for Brazil,\u201d Guilherme Mello, secretary for economic policy at the ministry of finance, told the Financial Times.\n\n\u201cFor you to have more investments, you have to at least have a competitive tax system.\u201d\n\nProponents of the reform say it will boost economic growth, with the potential to add as much as 2.39 per cent to gross domestic product over the next eight years, according to the Institute for Applied Economic Research, a government think-tank.\n\nAttempts at comprehensive reform eluded governments for decades, so its passage represents a political victory for leftwing President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and finance minister Fernando Haddad.\n\nHowever, there was criticism over the large number of exceptions to the new rules, following lobbying by interest groups. Full exemptions were granted for health services and basic foodstuffs such as rice and beans, among others. Public transportation as well as agricultural and livestock products were granted partial exceptions.\n\n\u201cThe system needed to be simplified, so that these resources can be used to improve company productivity and make investments more attractive,\u201d said Ariana Zerbinatti, partner at consultancy Buyside Brazil. \u201cOn the negative side, [there has been] a large number of exceptions\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that is part of the political game.\u201d\n\nAnother concern is what Congress will set the standard VAT rate to be. Haddad has said the number of exemptions was likely to push it up to 27.5 per cent, which opponents say would rank among the highest consumption taxes in the world.\n\nFinance ministry officials argue that this is still below the 34.4 per cent total amount currently charged on consumption by the myriad overlapping duties.\n\nThe reform will also end the practice of taxing goods where they are produced, instead shifting to a model with levies imposed at the point of consumption. This entire process will take 50 years to be fully implemented.\n\nThe legislation also seeks to purge elements widely regarded as regressive. Certain luxury items exempted from vehicle tax, such as jet skis, speedboats and yachts, will now be subject to the levy.\n\nWhile the Lula administration insists the package is not intended to increase the overall tax burden, it is separately pushing through measures to raise revenue collection in a bid to balance the public accounts. These include the imposition of duties on digital sports betting and assets held by wealthy citizens in tax havens.\n\n\u201cBrazil has lower income tax revenues and higher consumer tax revenues,\u201d said Mello. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the possibility of getting it more balanced.

The French leader said he had concerns about a lack of environmental targets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m against the Mercosur agreement with the European Union.

President-elect Javier Milei, a radical libertarian, has previously criticised the Mercosur bloc as protectionist. His designated foreign minister said last week that she supported the agreement with the EU, telling a business conference: \u201cIt would be much\u00a0better to have the agreement than not to have it.\u201d\n\nBut Milei and his administration are due to take office on December 10, further complicating the timeline for the deal as the new government\u2019s trade appointees will not take office until after the Mercosur meeting in Brazil.\n\nTwo EU diplomats said that chances of a deal this year were slipping, while one said talks towards the agreement could collapse altogether by summer 2024.\n\nNegotiators have faced a series of setbacks relating to the EU\u2019s desire to add more environmental commitments since a provisional agreement in 2019.\n\nA senior Brazilian diplomat said Bras\u00edlia intended to \u201ckeep working with the [European] Commission and the new Argentine government, since we are close to an agreement\u201d. Milei\u2019s government had indicated they wanted the agreement to proceed, the diplomat said.\n\nThe next few days, which coincide with the end of Brazil\u2019s tenure in the rotating Mercosur presidency, will be vital to finalising the agreement, which would be the first between the Mercosur bloc and one of its trading partners. It would cover countries with a total population of 780mn people.\n\nParaguayan President Santiago Pe\u00f1a has also warned that Mercosur could walk away if the EU does not finalise the treaty by December 6.\n\nOutstanding issues include competition in public procurement and concerns over the EU\u2019s deforestation legislation and environmental requirements.\n\nPresident Lula is due to land in Berlin on Sunday for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Unlike France, Germany\u2019s coalition government has backed the deal.\n\nLuisa Santos, deputy director general at the industry body BusinessEurope, said the agreement was crucial to the bloc\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cMercosur is even more important in a moment where our economy is facing headwinds and companies are struggling to remain competitive. Not doing Mercosur is a terrible mistake from a political, economic and sustainable development point of view,\u201d Santos said.\n\nA spokesperson for the commission said that the EU and Mercosur were \u201cengaged in intense and constructive discussions with a view to finalising a political, cooperation and trade agreement\u201d.\n\n\u201cNegotiations will continue in a constructive spirit with an ambition to conclude as swiftly as possible,\u201d they said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Michael Stott and Ciara Nugent", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f55c8ec8-f9e2-496b-a3df-db05cc4638cd"}}, {"id": "24e22eab-8ab8-4ef9-87b0-29400b4a4cf2", "event_name": "Indigenous Histories, S\u00e3o Paulo review \u2014 ambitious exhibition unites artists fighting for survival", "blurb": "Works ranging from the S\u00e1mi in northern Europe to the Xingu in Brazil reflect the battle against colonialism and capitalism", "date": "2023-12-0200:00:00.0", "body": "How do you make a museum show about Indigenous culture when the very idea of the museum, an invention of European enlightenment, has its roots in colonialism? This question rumbles behind but is never quite resolved in Indigenous Histories, the new show at Museu de Arte de S\u00e3o Paulo. It is also central to an indicative work in the exhibition: Peruvian artist Susana Torres\u2019s decision in 1999 to start collecting and exhibiting commercial products and consumer packaging featuring Inca imagery.\n\nThe curators at MASP present just one such example from Torres\u2019s Museo Neo Inka series (1999-2011): a sack of wheat flour that shows the head of an Inca man printed above the legally required nutritional table. For Torres it was ironic that the marketing people behind the flour, and brands such as Inca Kola (created by a British man in the 1930s) and Inca cigarettes (a favourite of poet Allen Ginsberg), were using the imagery to invoke a sense of tradition, while contemporary Peruvian Indigenous people were economically maligned and cut from the cultural conversation.\n\nIf this sprawling exhibition of 170 artists is an attempt to correct that, bringing Indigenous production into the canon, then it is certainly ambitious in its geographical spread. Programmed in collaboration with Norway\u2019s Kode Bergen Art Museum, where the show travels next year, it is divided into eight sections: seven devoted to regions in South America, North America, Oceania and Scandinavia, as well as a first room for pan-global examples of Indigenous resistance to colonialism and capitalist exploitation.\n\nIt opened as Australians voted against recognising Aboriginal communities and Torres Strait Islanders in the country\u2019s constitution and guaranteeing them a voice in decision-making but also as, more positively, Brazil\u2019s supreme court rejected a law limiting what might be considered Indigenous peoples\u2019 land. Indigenous issues are live today.\n\nIn the global room, a 2012 photograph by Alexander Luna feels symbolic of this never-ending fight for first peoples\u2019 rights. It shows M\u00e1xima Acu\u00f1a dressed in the traditional clothing of the Peruvian Andes, holding her fist aloft. Acu\u00f1a is smiling, but her story is deadly serious. In the years after the portrait was taken, Acu\u00f1a faced legal proceedings from American gold-mining company Newmont Corp, which said her home illegally occupied land it had purchased for a new development. She also claims to have been assaulted by Peruvian police after eviction proceedings began. Her torment only ended after a higher court found in her favour and stopped her eviction.\n\nThe activist\u2019s tale is a particularly dramatic one, but it is a similar fight for survival that unites the disparate communities present in the rest of the show. Just above Luna\u2019s photograph is the Tino Rangatiratanga Flag (1990), designed by Linda Munn, Hiraina Marsden and Jan Dobson as a symbol of M\u0101ori struggle in New Zealand; on facing walls are posters by Arvid Sveen illustrating S\u00e1mi political consciousness across Norway and Sweden. Documentary photography by Edgar Kanayk\u00f5 Xakriab\u00e1 shows the Free Land Camp, a meeting of Brazilian Indigenous communities that occupies grounds near government ministries annually.\n\nInviting guest curators to programme each of the different sections, while pragmatic, means the exhibition loses this initial cohesion. One gallery organised by Mexican artist Abraham Cruzvillegas is packed full of works from the early 20th century, tracing how the representation of Mexican Indigeneity was used to establish a national identity after the revolution of 1910-20. Paintings including \u201cOur Ancient Gods\u201d (1916) by Saturnino Herr\u00e1n and \u201cIndian Wedding\u201d (c1931) by Alfredo Ramos Mart\u00ednez are both complementary to Indigenous dignity and exoticising to modern eyes.\n\nFrom there, the viewer can either enter a gallery of Western Australian \u201cdesert painting\u201d or a gallery dedicated to the home culture of Canadian Inuit, First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities. In the former, Yala Yala Gibbs Tjungurrayi\u2019s \u201cWirrpi\u201d (1997) is an intoxicating abstract painting of interconnecting ochre, brown and orange orbs, while Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula\u2019s \u201cMitukatjirri\u201d (1986) displays similarly beguiling patterning.\n\nIn the latter, Canadian Indigenous artist Jim Logan\u2019s deeply evocative painting \u201cThe Visit\u201d (1987) hangs, depicting several generations of a family gather in a single room, wrapped up warm but steeped in poverty, the presence of beer bottles suggesting social problems. Kananginak Pootoogook\u2019s nearby bird\u2019s-eye painting of a boiling pot of berries is more idyllic in sensibility.\n\nAll three displays, from the sultry Modernist visions of Mexico to this frozen scene, are strong in their own right, but aside from a common enemy, the connection of these communities, separated by climates, continents and history, is tenuous.\n\nIn Brazil it is only in the past few years that artists from Indigenous groups have gained recognition. This year MASP dedicated a survey to the Movimento dos Artistas Huni Kuin, a collective of artists with Huni Kuin ethnicity from western Brazil. A painting by one member here, Acelino Huni Kuin, shows the \u201cbridge alligator\u201d, a giant creature of myth who lay across the Bering Strait to allow passage between the Americas and Asia, the story subverting notions of the \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d world. Meanwhile, the stick-figure pen drawings by Taniki Yanomami depict the circularity of birth and death in Yanomami culture. In uncompromising fashion, both present the Indigenous understanding of time as being fundamentally non-linear.\n\nIn gaining recognition, however, Indigenous artists have made sacrifices to western art markets. Waxamani Mehinako paints the rhythmic patterns the Xingu peoples traditionally use in body painting, textiles and basketry, but while he uses local pigments, he applies them to canvas, an easier sell within a westernised art market. Maintaining hierarchies of what is art and what is not, just one basketry object is included in the exhibition, a Wal\u00e1ya basket of arum\u00e3 fibre, by the Bainwa people, but the museum shop is full of lesser examples available to purchase.\n\nThe Peruvian artist Sandra Gamarra often hangs her own work, portraits of Spanish colonial nobility, upside down to upset the historic power dynamic between her subject and her Indigenous identity, and tasked with curating a section dedicated to her own country she chose to hang the work similarly. Facing the contemporary Indigenous work, all upside down, is a series of 18th-century oil paintings, only one of which, a Cusco school portrait of St Francisco Javier owned by MASP, is turned on its head. The lenders of the others, a Spanish museum, refused the request on conservation grounds: a signal that for all the progress evident in Indigenous Histories, an important show, if not a perfect one, there is some distance left to run in art\u2019s decolonising mission.\n\nTo February 25, masp.org.br\n\nFollow FTWeekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ac6f9f47-cc22-4859-85e4-1c192be353bf"}}, {"id": "663c672e-601d-4c9f-b360-f4f53e0a07db", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s focus on farms and forests to cut emissions risks setback from oil", "blurb": "Success on deforestation and agricultural reforms contrasts with country\u2019s huge expansion in hydrocarbons", "date": "2023-11-3000:00:00.0", "body": "The Amazon rainforest is often portrayed as a giant carbon sink for the world, soaking up emissions generated elsewhere. So it may come as a surprise that Brazil, home to 60 per cent of the rainforest, is the world\u2019s fifth-biggest emitter of CO\u2082 \u2014 with more than two-thirds of those emissions coming from agriculture, forestry and other land use.\n\nThose numbers highlight how the country\u2019s path to reaching its target of net zero emissions by 2050 has little in common with that of most other countries, where energy, industrial processes and waste are the biggest problems.\n\n\u201cThe challenges and opportunities are different for Brazil to most other countries,\u201d says Arthur Ramos, who leads Boston Consulting Group\u2019s climate practice in Brazil. \u201cWhile power generation is 90 per cent renewable, deforestation and agriculture are the biggest issues to tackle as they account for 70 per cent of emissions. Deforestation alone accounts for 50 per cent.\u201d\n\nEven before taking office at the start of the year, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signalled his commitment to Brazil\u2019s pledge of net zero emissions by 2050 by attending the COP27 climate summit in Egypt and announcing that his administration would \u201cdo whatever it takes to have zero deforestation\u201d.\n\nDestruction of the Amazon rainforest had surged under Lula\u2019s far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, and the new government has restored resources for environmental agencies that had been cut back. It has also taken quick action to fulfil an existing pledge to halt deforestation completely by 2028.\n\n\u201cIn the first eight months of this year, the Lula government has achieved a 48 per cent reduction of deforestation,\u201d says Andr\u00e9 Aranha Corr\u00eaa do Lago, secretary for climate, energy and environment at Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry. \u201cIf you take into consideration the atypical profile of our emissions\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009this means we are close to reducing more than 20 per cent of our emissions in one year.\u201d\n\nAlmost all deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is unlawful, the result of illegal logging, mining and ranching. Land grabbers also seize forest to convert it to pasture for farming or land speculation.\n\nIlona Szab\u00f3, president of the Igarap\u00e9 Institute, an independent think-tank based in Rio de Janeiro, believes \u201cBrazil will probably be the country which most reduced emissions in 2023, simply because of the result in reducing deforestation\u201d.\n\nOn agriculture, the government intends to present a plan at COP28 in Dubai to recover degraded pasture by offering farmers financing to buy or lease unproductive land and improve it. Brazil currently has about 200mn head of cattle on 200mn hectares of land \u2014 a low level of productivity that the government believes could be doubled with better technology.\n\nBrazil is the world\u2019s largest exporter of soyabeans, poultry, coffee, sugar cane, frozen beef and orange juice, and has long been a technological pioneer in boosting crop yields, but its cattle ranching is relatively low tech.\n\nIts farm exports, however, face a threat from a new EU law adopted this year banning the import of many farm products from recently deforested land. Farmers will need to supply traceability data showing their supply chain is deforestation-free.\n\n\u201cCattle farming is the biggest challenge within the agricultural sector,\u201d says Ramos. \u201cAs well as the conversion of land for ranching, there is also the question of methane emissions, which can be reduced by changing the feed given to cattle and increasing the productivity of land used.\u201d\n\nIn the energy sector, Brazil has both challenges and opportunities. The country\u2019s high proportion of renewably generated electricity \u2014 the result of decades of investment in hydroelectric dams and recent solar and wind projects \u2014 could allow it to compete in emerging global markets such as green hydrogen.\n\nHowever, the country is also engaged in a big build-up of its oil industry, with the government aiming to turn Brazil into the world\u2019s fourth-biggest producer of crude by 2029, thanks to the development of giant offshore fields.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian government and [state-controlled energy company] Petrobras must stop the country\u2019s colossal expansion of oil and gas,\u201d argues Martin Dietrich Brauch, a researcher at the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment in New York. \u201cThis expansion is inconsistent with climate action and with the role that the country wants to play in emissions reduction.\u201d\n\nBrauch\u2019s call is unlikely to be heeded, though. The Lula government is committed to the expansion of oil, arguing that it needs the revenues to fund social justice and pay for better infrastructure and a shift to clean energy.\n\nNonetheless, with Brazil set to host COP30 in 2025, there is optimism that the country can build on its strengths in renewables, halt deforestation and improve agricultural technology. \u201cBrazil knows it has to do more, but it\u2019s not reaching the [negotiating] table timidly \u2014 it is coming with results,\u201d says Szab\u00f3.\n\nThe Brazilian delegation at COP will insist on a stronger multilateral approach to combating climate change, says Corr\u00eaa do Lago at the foreign ministry: \u201cThe lack of trust that exists among countries today is acute.

In the case of Brazil, the CO\u2082 released by deforestation accounts for about half of the country\u2019s total emissions.\n\n\u201cWe need to have resources in volume, quantity and frequency to finance those who own forests,\u201d Marina Silva, Brazil\u2019s environment minister, told the Financial Times. \u201cBecause today the initiatives we have only encourage those who are deforesting to stop deforesting. They don\u2019t encourage or pay those who are already preserving and keeping the forests standing.\u201d\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the proposal, one option being considered is an investment fund with money from institutional and other long-term investors, with a set rate of return. Anything the fund earns above this rate would go directly to forest dwellers to maintain their habitats.\n\nAfter years of being seen as an environmental villain under Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency, Bras\u00edlia is keen to demonstrate it is fighting climate change and can reap economic benefits from doing so. The country has been confirmed as the host of the 30th UN climate summit, to be held the Amazonian city of Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 in 2025.\n\n\u201c[We] want to show concrete initiatives,\u201d said one of the individuals involved in the government\u2019s proposal. \u201cThis plan is part of the discussion on how to value nature and standing forest and meet the urgency of the moment. It is part of the nature-based economy that needs to be created to replace the illicit economy in the rainforest.\u201d\n\nThe idea originated at a summit for Amazonian nations in Brazil earlier this year and its officials hope it will eventually be supported by 80 countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not top-down. It has to be a bottom-up exercise,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Aranha Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a senior Brazilian diplomat, about Bras\u00edlia\u2019s environmental efforts. \u201cAt COP28, we\u2019re going to have the beginning of a very important new stage. What has to be done will be debated first by the countries that have tropical forests.\u201d\n\nLula took office in January this year on pledges to protect the environment and crack down on deforestation in the Amazon, which surged under Bolsonaro. Almost all deforestation in the rainforest is carried out illegally by myriad interests including loggers, ranchers and wildcat gold miners.\n\nLula\u2019s efforts have shown promising early signs, with the country reporting an almost 50 per cent drop in deforestation in the first eight months of the year compared with the same period last year.\n\nThe leftwing leader has also been outspoken about the need for developed economies to shoulder a larger burden in the fight against climate change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to COP28 with the aim of telling the rich world that if they want to effectively preserve what\u2019s left of the forest, they need to put money not just into looking after the forest canopy, but into looking after the people who live there,\u201d Lula said earlier this year.\n\nPeople involved in the plan expect the fund to start small \u2014 potentially about $100mn \u2014 but to grow substantially. \u201cEveryone knows it has to be much bigger than $100mn,\u201d said one person close to the government, adding that investors may be deterred \u201cif you start by asking for a trillion [dollars]\u201d.\n\nThe fund would be likely to be co-ordinated by a multilateral institution such as the World Bank, said two people involved.\n\n\u201cWe know that there needs to be a volume of resources that perhaps, until today, has never been proposed,\u201d said Silva. \u201cAlthough many initiatives for forest protection exist, unfortunately the private resources have not been\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009contributed.

On a sweltering tropical afternoon, the septuagenarian artisan describes how this depicts the floods of 2010, when 50 residents from her village of Muqu\u00e9m, in the hilly and verdant countryside of northeastern Brazil, climbed up a pair of jackfruit trees and stayed there overnight to survive the rising waters.\n\nThe ceramic work is an apt memorial to the centuries of resistance by traditional rural communities known as quilombos which are scattered throughout the vast country. Descended from settlements originally founded by escaped slaves during colonial times, they have long been a symbol of struggle against oppression and hold an important place in Afro-Brazilian heritage.\n\nNow, for the first time, a census has recorded the number of citizens who belong to these socio-ethnic groups. Quilombolas, as they are called, numbered 1.3mn in 2022, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. At 0.7 per cent of the overall population, they are not far behind the 1.7mn indigenous Brazilians.\u00a0\u201cBefore we didn\u2019t have this identification of our ethnicity or culture,\u201d says Dorinha Calvacanti, the head of a residents association in Muqu\u00e9m. \u201cIt was a very important milestone.\u201d\n\nThe community of 800 quilombolas in the state of Alagoas traces its origins back to the largest and most famous quilombo, Palmares. During the 17th century, Palmares grew into an autonomous confederation of settlements over mountains and forest. At its peak, there were an estimated 20,000 inhabitants, including runaway slaves, native people and white Europeans. Its last ruler, Zumbi, repelled numerous attacks by Portuguese forces before the kingdom\u2019s capital fell in 1694, and was killed a year later. Following the abolition of slavery in 1888, the warrior king became a hero of the 20th century Afro-Brazilian political movement. The date of his execution \u2014 November 20 \u2014 is celebrated as Brazil\u2019s Black Consciousness Day.\n\nDespite their belated recognition in today\u2019s records, just under 3,600 self-declared quilombos continue to be afflicted by poverty, unemployment, discrimination and poor access to public services. Historically marginalised, few possess land titles. Even if the census data helps deliver better public policies, the long wait for inclusion is \u201ca symptom of the structural and institutional racism of the Brazilian state\u201d, argues professor Vagner Gomes Bijag\u00f3 at the Federal University of Alagoas.\u00a0\u201cThese challenges greatly impact the preservation of quilombola culture.\u201d\n\nLife in Muqu\u00e9m has greatly improved since the floods \u2014 the village has relocated uphill and new bungalows with plastered walls and tiled roofs have been built along asphalted roads. There is a health clinic and school. \u201c[In the past] the best you could do was be a cane cutter or domestic worker. But today we have nurses and teachers,\u201d Calvacanti tells me.\n\nBut the dwindling of the population, as residents seek better opportunities elsewhere, is a constant worry. While Muqu\u00e9m\u2019s men have often worked away in sugar mills and farms, the number of families has fallen from 225 to 180 since last year. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have work, the younger people are going to leave and we will lose our identity,\u201d she says.\n\nNunes, the potter, has gained a degree of fame \u2014 foreign visitors flock to buy her terracotta heads, figurines of kissing couples and bowls. \u201cI never went to school,\u201d she says. \u201cI discovered this art, it was God who gave it to me [and] I\u2019m proud\u201d. Yet she fears that the community\u2019s traditional practice of ceramics \u2014 a source of income alongside family agriculture \u2014 could eventually disappear.\n\nIn another corner of the village, 31-year-old Edilene arrives home from work in a nearby municipality. Motivated to make a better future for her family and neighbours, she hopes to finish university next year.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t intend to leave here. You know why?

It was home to an oil discovery considered the western hemisphere\u2019s most significant for 30 years in the first decade of this century.\n\n\u201cThere were doubts over whether we would be able to develop it,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Ferreira Junior, manager aboard the P-71 vessel in the Itapu field. \u201cThe expectation was fulfilled and this turned a page for Brazil, putting it on the world stage as a petroleum producer.\u201d\n\nThe South American country\u2019s overall output of the commodity grew 4 per cent in 2022 to 3mn barrels a day, with three-quarters from pre-salt areas, ranking it as the planet\u2019s ninth-largest oil-producing nation.\n\nRising output from these vast deepwater reserves underpins an ambitious target by the Bras\u00edlia government to reach fourth place by the end of the decade with 5.4mn b/d, ahead of the likes of Iran, Canada and Kuwait.\n\nAt the forefront of that drive is $99bn-valued Petrobras. Latin America\u2019s largest oil and gas business is state-controlled but with outside shareholders and a stock market listing.\n\nWhile the Rio de Janeiro-based group was given priority over the pre-salt resources and dominates the activities, it operates many fields in consortiums with international groups such as Shell, TotalEnergies, QatarEnergy, Malaysia\u2019s Petronas and China\u2019s Cnooc, among others.\n\n\u201cThis year we will exceed our goals [and] surpass what we predicted,\u201d said Joelson Falc\u00e3o Mendes, director of exploration and production at Petrobras. \u201cWe have significant and growing production for the coming years.\u201d\n\nFirst found in 2006 and chiefly located in the Santos Basin, the pre-salt deposits presented technical challenges. At depths of up to 7km beneath the water\u2019s surface, including layers of rock and 2,000 metres of salt to be drilled through, development required colossal amounts of capital.\n\nThe resource is now a cash gusher \u2014 both for the national coffers and outside investors in Petrobras, founded 70 years ago as Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro.\n\nPre-salt production rose from 41,000 b/d in 2010 to 2.3mn last year, fuelling record annual profits of R$188bn (US$39bn) and dividends of R$216bn at the company.\n\n\u201cFor the shareholders \u2014 controlling and minority \u2014 pre-salt [operations] mean really good returns combined with production growth,\u201d said Gabriel Barra, analyst at Citi. \u201cIt is finally paying off.\u201d\n\nWhile net income fell by two-fifths to $5.5bn in the third quarter \u2014 hit by lower oil prices and a weaker dollar \u2014 Petrobras increased total crude volumes by almost 10 per cent year on year.\n\nTo further boost extraction, it plans to launch another 11 platforms in the pre-salt region by 2027.\n\nHowever, with output from the fields expected to peak by 2029 and then start falling, there are questions over the future strategic steps for both the company and Brazil.\n\nThe rush to secure reserves of hydrocarbons \u2014 the chief components of petroleum and natural gas \u2014 has been underscored by blockbuster takeover deals by US oil industry supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron in the past weeks.\n\nYet as the world seeks to avert catastrophic climate change, the very soundness of Brazil\u2019s continued wager on oil and gas has been challenged.\n\nCritics say it exposes a contradiction within the green agenda of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has promised greater ecological protection and sustainable development.\n\nThe pre-salt riches were discovered during the leftwing president\u2019s first stint in office and his Workers\u2019 party (PT) considers it one of his legacies.\n\nAlthough the Lula administration and Petrobras have pledged to back cleaner alternatives, fossil fuels remain a pillar of national policy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any type of contradiction,\u201d said Mendes. \u201cAs an integrated energy company, we can use what we [generate] in oil and gas production to invest in renewable energy.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOil will still occupy an important place in the energy matrix [alongside] renewables. We want to do this together.\u201d\n\nPetrobras has pledged more of its capital expenditure budget to low-carbon projects since Lula returned to power. But with global crude demand forecast to decline in the next decade, campaigners argue it should pivot away from polluting activities more quickly.\n\nEnrico Marone at Greenpeace rails against the idea that \u201cBrazil will be the last country to produce and export oil in the throes of the now outdated petroleum era\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to keep betting on fossil fuel sources when the world is looking for urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\nPetrobras counters that pre-salt oil is cheap and relatively clean compared with other sources, and therefore an ideal supply as societies remain dependent on hydrocarbons during the energy transition.\n\nPre-salt wells offer huge economies of scale that bring down unit costs, say analysts. The sheer size of operations is shown by the P-71: a floating production, storage and offloading unit (FPSO) that looks like a massive ship.\n\nA 316-metre-long industrial complex of gantries, pipework and heavy equipment with about 160 workers on board, it started production in December 2022 and can process 150,000 barrels a day.\n\nPre-salt oil costs roughly $35/barrel to produce, according to Schreiner Parker at consultancy Rystad Energy, well below current international benchmark prices of about $90. The CO\u2082 emitted in the production is also half the global average for a barrel of oil of 18kg/b, he added.\n\n\u201cThat combination of low break-even cost and low emissions intensity means those pre-salt barrels are what we called privileged,\u201d said Parker, whose firm forecasts Brazil will be the fifth-biggest oil producer by the end of the decade.\n\n\u201cBy 2050, even in the most conservative scenario, we\u2019re still going to need around half the oil that we consume today. You\u2019ll have significant Brazilian production throughout the 2030s and into the 2040s, but the question is: what\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nThe answer may be a new offshore frontier located in a 2,200km tract of deep waters along Brazil\u2019s north coast, called the Equatorial Margin.\n\nProponents believe it could be Brazil\u2019s next oil frontier and draw comparisons with neighbouring Guyana, where vast offshore reserves are now being exploited by Exxon.\n\nEstimated to contain 10bn recoverable barrels, Petrobras has allocated half its $6bn exploration budget for the Equatorial Margin over the next five years.\n\nThe company recently received permission to drill exploratory wells in one of the region\u2019s five basins, but it faces obstacles to the section regarded as the main prize, located off the mouth of the Amazon river.\n\nActivists claim the block lies near an ecologically sensitive zone, posing risks to wildlife and nearby indigenous populations.\u00a0After refusing a drilling request, Brazil\u2019s environmental agency is considering an appeal filed by Petrobras.\n\nBeyond oil, the company believes its experience on the high seas equips it to become Brazil\u2019s leading developer of offshore wind. Mendes said such projects could potentially supply electricity to oil rigs.\n\n\u201cIn theory, offshore wind is simpler than oil production in deep waters. Historically it requires less technology. The big question is whether we can do this at competitive costs.\u201d\n\nIn line with Lula\u2019s campaign pledge, Petrobras is also pursuing a strategy of diversification outside its core of oil and gas, with greater investments in areas such as refining, biofuels and petrochemicals. Analysts, however, warn this could result in lower financial returns.\n\nAnother concern for minority shareholders is the spectre of political interference in the business \u2014 a hallmark of past PT administrations, under whom Petrobras was embroiled in a sprawling corruption scandal, lost tens of billions of dollars subsidising fuel and racked up massive debts.\n\nCiti\u2019s Barra said it was difficult to assess the longer-term scenario for Petrobras because of frequent changes at the top, with chief executives chosen by the government of the day: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a new CEO every one-and-a-half years on average.\u201d\n\nFor Ferreira, the pre-salt riches can unlock the company\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cMy view is that we invest in the pre-salt [operations] to change the energy matrix,\u201d the P-71 rig manager said, staring out into the Atlantic. \u201cIf you look back, Petrobras went from onshore [oil] to offshore, then to deepwater. Now it can go to renewables.\u201d\n\nThis article has been amended since publication to remove a chart showing the forecast output of non-Opec producing countries.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/76a1ccb0-8534-4513-8fb5-5eb5e07773bd"}}, {"id": "6d39589b-37d0-44ca-aa4c-d57ba3c93097", "event_name": "Investors pile into Brazil\u2019s first sustainable bond", "blurb": "Also in today\u2019s newsletter, private capital struggles to rise to the global climate challenge", "date": "2023-11-1500:00:00.0", "body": "\u201cBrazil is back,\u201d then president-elect Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva told a crowd at the COP27 climate summit this time last year, signalling a break with the environmental backsliding under his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nSince then he and his officials have been repeating that message to anyone who will listen \u2014 including sustainable bond investors who, as I write below, gave it a pretty enthusiastic reception.\n\nAlso today, in the run-up to intense debates on this subject at COP28, we look at how far the private capital sector is \u2014 or is not \u2014 rising to the green finance challenge.\n\nWe\u2019re holding our first Moral Money Summit Africa on Tuesday November 21, in Johannesburg and online \u2014 featuring in-depth debate on the continent\u2019s biggest opportunities and challenges.

But today\u2019s investors have clearly warmed to the idea: Brazil\u2019s $2bn issuance received $6bn worth of orders.\n\nThis enthusiasm enabled the government to sell the seven-year bonds with an interest rate of 6.5 per cent, well below the 6.8 per cent it had earlier targeted in marketing the securities.\n\nThis is especially encouraging given that it\u2019s been a tough couple of years for developing nation sovereign debt issuers as interest rates rose around the world.\n\nThis sustainable bond issuance has narrowed the spread \u2014 the additional borrowing cost \u2014 between Brazil and peers such as Mexico, which enjoy an investment-grade credit rating. That\u2019s a top priority for Brazil, which lost its own such rating in 2016 amid a massive political and economic crisis.\n\nThe investor appetite reflects optimism over Lula\u2019s green pledges, which followed four years of rampant deforestation in the Amazon region under former president Jair Bolsonaro. As the treasury\u2019s investor slideshow noted, the deforestation rate fell dramatically in the first half of this year (albeit to a level that is still hugely worrying).\n\nBut this is not just about Brazil. A recent report by S&P Global on the green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked bond (GSSSB) space made clear that sovereign issuers are an increasingly important part of this awkwardly named market segment.\n\nSovereigns accounted for 18 per cent of GSSSB issuance in the first half of this year \u2014 up from 11 per cent last year and 7 per cent in 2019. Latin America has been a relatively strong mover in this space, with seven countries in the region issuing GSSSBs before Brazil joined the party. Chile has been particularly active, with $30bn of issuance so far.\n\nOther issuers have included state-owned entities in top oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sparking debate about how far this sort of debt is really driving progress on sustainability.\n\nThe issuance by Brazil, which is also a major oil producer, is interesting in this regard. The government\u2019s investor presentation gives it huge leeway on how the funds will be deployed. Eligible categories of \u201csocial projects\u201d \u2014 which will receive up to half the proceeds of this week\u2019s issuance \u2014 include \u201cemployment generation\u201d, which covers just about anything.\n\nBut the government has also committed to publishing, through a newly formed body, an annual report spelling out how the proceeds of GSSSB issuances are being deployed. The first of these, to be published within the next 12 months, will give this week\u2019s bond buyers an idea of whether their enthusiasm was justified.\n\nOne of the fiercest debates at the COP28 climate summit \u2014 which starts in just 15 days \u2014 will be over how to mobilise the vast flows of green investment needed in the developing countries where most humans live.\n\nA report published today points to some interesting developments on that front \u2014 but also grounds for concern.\n\nWhile private capital funds focused on climate strategies in developing countries enjoyed a bumper fundraising year in 2021 \u2014 pulling in $6.2bn \u2014 that figure fell back to $2.7bn last year, according to the new Global Private Capital Association research. This year, the funds have regained some momentum, raising $2.4bn by the end of June.\n\nGiven the huge role that private capital will need to play in addressing climate and energy transition challenges in these countries, the investment flows here are meagre.\n\nA major study published last November, from an expert group chaired by economists Vera Songwe and Nicholas Stern, found that climate-related investment in developing countries needed to reach $2.4tn a year by 2030. Today\u2019s GPCA report found that, since 2015, climate funds targeting developing countries have raised a cumulative total of less than $30bn.\n\nWithin that, the biggest haul in the first half of 2023 was secured by Beijing\u2019s IDG Capital, which raised $709mn to invest in clean tech. Cape Town-based Inspired Evolution hoovered up $199mn and Rio de Janeiro-headquartered Vinci Partners pulled in $185mn for low-carbon infrastructure in Africa and Brazil, respectively.\n\nThis reflects a long-term trend among asset owners, GPCA chief executive Cate Ambrose told me, to invest in emerging markets by allocating capital to fund management firms that are based in those regions.\n\nThere is also a clear movement by fund managers towards greater geographic specialisation. In 2020, 85 per cent of climate funds targeting developing countries had a \u201cmulti-region\u201d investment mandate. In the first half of 2023, 89 per cent had an explicit focus on a single region.\n\nTellingly, most of the world\u2019s biggest climate-focused funds \u2014 such as Brookfield\u2019s Global Transition Fund and TPG\u2019s Rise Climate fund \u2014 were excluded from the GPCA study because, according to the analysis, they look set to deploy most of their capital in developed economies.\n\nOne notable exception there was Actis\u2019s Energy 5 fund, which has raised $4.7bn to invest in developing-nation clean energy infrastructure.

And it\u2019s not,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is a crime.\u201d\n\nWhat looks like the aftermath of a war zone is in fact an urban environmental disaster of allegedly man-made origin, which has forced an estimated 55,000 people to permanently evacuate their homes in the seaside city of Macei\u00f3, north-eastern Brazil.\n\nThe reason for the mass departures was slowly sinking soil, which triggered cracks in buildings and craters in roads. The blame has been placed \u2014 by an official geology agency, as well as locals \u2014 on decades of underground salt mining by Braskem, Latin America\u2019s largest petrochemicals producer.\n\nSince the problems first emerged in early 2018, some 14,400 properties have been condemned on safety grounds because of the risks of subsidence. The exodus has turned whole blocks in the capital of Alagoas state into virtual ghost towns.\n\nBraskem is now facing legal actions that could add considerably to the R$14.6bn ($3bn) it has so far provisioned for costs related to the incident, a sum not far off the chemical group\u2019s current market value of $3.2bn.\n\nThe calamity not only casts a shadow over a potential blockbuster takeover of Braskem, which has attracted international interest. To corporate critics, it falls into a pattern of behaviour by natural resource companies in the South American country, where twice in the past decade mining waste dams have collapsed with devastating consequences.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened in Macei\u00f3 is just another example of a large company making vast profits in Brazil, taking from the land and destroying the local environment and the local communities. To make matters worse they do not act properly and fairly when something does go wrong,\u201d says Tom Goodhead, chief executive of Pogust Goodhead.\n\nThe law firm is bringing a case in the Netherlands, home to a Braskem subsidiary, on behalf of 10 victims who argue they were not offered fair redress.\n\nAfter a judge in Rotterdam granted jurisdiction, a hearing on the merits is scheduled for February. The lawyers have not yet publicly quantified the damages they are seeking. But if there is a favourable ruling and another 60-70,000 affected parties lodge their own claims, Goodhead estimates the total alleged liability could reach $3bn.\n\nWhile no direct fatalities have resulted from the geological disturbances in Macei\u00f3, there are accounts of suicides, livelihoods lost and communities torn apart.\n\nOne of the claimants in the Dutch lawsuit, Maria Ros\u00e2ngela Ferreira da Silva, believes the upheaval of her family having to move played a part in her elderly mother\u2019s demise.\n\n\u201cShe went into a deep depression,\u201d recounts the 60-year-old civil servant tearfully. \u201cShe was hospitalised and in shock at the change. And then she didn\u2019t want to live anymore.\u201d\n\nOn Maria Ros\u00e2ngela\u2019s old street, in a corner of Pinheiro she says was once vibrant, overgrowth creeps through crumbling ruins. Nothing stirs except birdsong and the rustle of leaves.\n\nShe recalls the close bonds between neighbours and outdoor parties organised on public holidays such as carnival. \u201cAll that is gone.\u201d\n\nSimilar scenes scar five neighbourhoods in the city of 960,000 inhabitants, located on a stretch of coast famed for its beaches and crystalline waters.\n\nThere are gutted tower blocks, middle-class homes and favela dwellings. Buildings in imminent danger of collapse have been demolished and empty residential rows hidden behind metal fences, the roof tiles stripped by departing homeowners for money. About 3,600 businesses have closed, according to authorities.\n\nRock salt extraction underneath Macei\u00f3 began in the 1970s and the business fell under Braskem\u2019s control after its formation through a merger of six companies in 2002.\n\nBrine was pumped to the company\u2019s nearby plants manufacturing caustic soda and PVC, a plastic used in the construction, automotive and food industries.\n\nSigns that something was wrong came to light when residents of Pinheiro noticed fissures in their homes following heavy rainfall in 2018. Weeks later an earthquake struck several neighbourhoods. Sinkholes appeared in roads, as splits spread in walls and floors.\n\nA 2019 report by the Geological Survey of Brazil concluded that there was a direct link between the subsidence and the mining, because of instability in subterranean cavities left by the activity.\n\nBraskem at first said the study was flawed and inconclusive. It now argues there are other contributory factors alongside the mining, such as the region\u2019s geology and deficient drainage, sewerage and construction quality.\n\nEven so, the company ceased rock salt extraction in 2019 and today imports the raw material. Braskem is filling in the 35 defunct wells as part of remedial works, and this year signed a R$1.7bn compensation accord with the municipality of Macei\u00f3.\n\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo-headquartered corporation has already paid out R$3.8bn in compensation, financial aid and relocation support, under a redress scheme agreed in 2020 with public prosecutors and defenders. It told the Financial Times that 93 per cent of the anticipated indemnification payments have now been made.\n\nBraskem declined an interview request, but said it was \u201ccommitted to repairing, mitigating and compensating\u201d the impacts of the subsidence. It added that the Dutch proceedings were \u201cstill in the preliminary phase\u201d with \u201cno value assigned\u201d, noting that five individuals had withdrawn from the action after reaching agreements. It also provides psychological services to those affected.\n\nHowever, several residents told the FT they felt the amounts Braskem offered for their properties were too low. The company says anyone unhappy with proposals can request a re-evaluation and ask a court to determine the settlement.\n\nAnother common complaint is that the fixed sum of R$40,000 per household for \u201cmoral damages\u201d \u2014 non-financial harm such as mental distress \u2014 is inadequate and does not take into account individual circumstances.\n\nCommunity leader Augusto C\u00edcero da Silva describes the amount as \u201cshameful\u201d. Now living 110km away from his old neighbourhood of Bebedouro, where he also ran a small grocery store, he returns for a few days each week to run a dwindling residents association.\n\n\u201cIt was demoralising for these people who suffered so much and continue to suffer today,\u201d says the 67-year-old. \u201cThere were people who died of heartbreak because of all this.\u201d\n\nBraskem said it had looked to \u201cthe jurisprudence on moral damages\u201d in general and similar cases when defining the parameters.\n\nThe public defender\u2019s office for the state of Alagoas told the FT that it believed each victim should be paid R$70,000 and it expected to launch legal proceedings at the start of 2024. Braskem did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed action.\n\nA judge also recently ruled the government of Alagoas \u2014 one of Brazil\u2019s poorest states, which claims it suffered an impact of R$35.8bn from the disaster \u2014 was owed compensation with the amount to be calculated by an expert.\u00a0Braskem intends to appeal against the decision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had damage and losses in taxes, job creation and the economic dynamics,\u201d governor Paulo Dantas told the FT. He has urged Brazil\u2019s federal audit court to suspend the sale of a controlling stake in Braskem by the construction conglomerate Novonor.\n\nAdding further national scrutiny, a parliamentary inquiry into the episode is planned. The situation will be on the radar of the leftwing administration of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, not least since Braskem\u2019s other main shareholder is the state-controlled oil major Petrobras.\n\nMeanwhile, those on the ground are bearing the brunt. Residents of the Flexais district, which is outside the evacuation zones, say they have become isolated because of the surrounding desertion.\n\nThey complain of a rise in criminality and vermin, as well as the loss of amenities and a paucity of employment and public transport. Many want to be rehomed but do not qualify.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken away our dreams. I worry there\u2019s no hope for him here,\u201d says 34-year-old Jainny Vieira, rocking her baby son.\n\nAlongside security patrols and pest control for vacated areas, Braskem says it has funded a package of measures for Flexais, including a free bus route and youth training. It also plans to build a new health clinic, day care centre and school.\n\nBut, says Jainny: \u201cWhat people want is relocation.\u201d\n\nOthers in the risk zones are determined to stay put. Nereu Rezende says his residence is the last one still occupied in Bebedouro. The 66-year-old musician has refused to leave because the cost to replace his home recording studio would be prohibitive.\n\n\u201cI built this house brick by brick,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want me out, they can kill me.\u201d\n\nPhotography and additional reporting by Ricardo Lisboa\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/35dbff19-26b7-4df8-ad78-2b2259ff7c8c"}}, {"id": "1c4bdea7-68e0-4e78-ab48-c5058a19f69f", "event_name": "Israel says spy agency Mossad helped foil terror plot in Brazil", "blurb": "Two arrested in S\u00e3o Paulo after Hizbollah cell was alleged to have been planning an attack on Jewish targets", "date": "2023-11-0800:00:00.0", "body": "Israel claimed to have helped foil an attack on Jewish targets allegedly planned by Hizbollah in Brazil, where authorities arrested two people on terror charges.\n\nPolice in Bras\u00edlia on Wednesday said the arrests in S\u00e3o Paulo were part of an operation to \u201cinterrupt preparatory acts of terrorism\u201d and obtain evidence about the possible recruitment of Brazilians to carry out extremist acts in the country.\n\nThey also served 11 search and seizure warrants in the states of Minas Gerais, S\u00e3o Paulo and the Federal District.

But vast sections of the waterway are currently dry.\n\nFor weeks, an unprecedented drought has pummelled the region, reducing water levels in key Amazonian arteries to record lows and wreaking havoc on local communities and the unique wildlife of the biome.\n\nThe immediate victims of the drought are more than half a million people in Brazil\u2019s Amazonas state, who are suffering an unfolding humanitarian emergency as the region\u2019s river-borne transportation is choked by the lack of water.\n\nBut the drought also has far-reaching implications for the Earth\u2019s climate. As the extreme heat and water shortage kills trees and sparks fires, the forest begins to release its enormous stocks of carbon dioxide, fuelling the process of global warming that scientists say was an important factor behind the drought in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt is starting a vicious circle that will destroy forest,\u201d said Philip Fearnside, a scientist at the National Institute for Amazonian Research in Manaus.\n\n\u201cBecause of this huge stock of carbon in the forest, the Amazon is at the centre of this question of global warming escaping from human control. If just a fraction comes out, it would be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. And there is an increasing risk of that happening.\u201d\n\nIn Manaus, a port city in the heart of the rainforest, the watermark of the river has fallen as low as 12.7m \u2014 more than 6m below the historic average for October \u2014 leaving the docks barren as the region\u2019s rivers lose much of their transport function.\n\nMore than 60 municipalities in Amazonas, the state that includes Manaus, are officially in a state of emergency, with the government rushing in basic supplies including food, water and medicines.\n\n\u201cRivers are our roads, so it has become impossible to go anywhere,\u201d said Fredson Farias, who sells boat tickets at Manaus port. He estimated that footfall had dropped by 70 per cent.\n\n\u201cThere are parts of the river that are 95 per cent dry. In 100 years we\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe immediate cause of the drought is a combination of the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o weather event, which warms the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean\u2019s surface, and an unusual patch of warm water in the Atlantic Ocean above the equator.\n\nThe two phenomena have inhibited the formation of clouds and caused rainfall to drop sharply. In Bel\u00e9m, a city in the eastern Amazon, rainfall in September was a quarter of typical levels.\n\nIn addition to the Rio Negro, which is one of the world\u2019s largest rivers by discharge levels, the huge Amazon, Solim\u00f5es and Madeira rivers have all hit record lows and are, in parts, dry.\n\nExperts say the intensity of the events in the Pacific and Atlantic \u2014 not in themselves caused by human activity \u2014 has been worsened by climate change.\n\n\u201cGlobal warming is clearly making a contribution to this exceptional drought,\u201d said Tim Lenton, chair in climate change and Earth system science at the University of Exeter.\n\n\u201cIt has added to the warmth in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific where El Ni\u00f1o is creating its usual warm water pool. It has also contributed to unprecedented warm sea surface temperatures in the north Atlantic. Both patterns of ocean heating are contributing to the current drought.\u201d\n\nFurther complicating the situation are exceptionally high temperatures. On October 10, the national meteorology institute reported a reading of 40C in Manaus, the highest since records began almost a century ago.\n\nThe heat and lack of rain have created prime conditions for fires, which \u2014 like the drought itself \u2014 can kill trees, damage the ecosystem and cause the release of more carbon into the atmosphere.\n\nA UK-Brazil study from 2021 found that droughts and fires resulting from the 2015-16 El Ni\u00f1o caused the death of more than 2.5bn trees and woody vines and the release of almost 500mn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nLast month was the worst October for fires in Amazonas state since records began 25 years ago, with more than 3,400 blazes reported, according to the state government.\n\nThe events have fuelled concerns that parts of the world\u2019s largest rainforest are being pushed towards so-called \u201ctipping points\u201d, where the mass mortality of trees means the rainforest can no longer sustain its water recycling ecosystem. This would fuel more droughts, more tree mortality and potentially sharp climate fluctuations across Latin America and the world.\n\n\u201cThe forest is succumbing,\u201d said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a Brazilian non-profit group. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen as a whole or all at once, but in some regions you\u2019re already experiencing these inflection points.\u201d\n\nFollowing rampant deforestation in recent years, several parts of the Amazon, notably in the south-eastern section in Par\u00e1 state, are already emitting more carbon than they absorb, according to several studies.\n\n\u201cYou can expect more droughts like this one to happen. That is what the models show,\u201d said Fearnside.\n\nAt the docks in Manaus, the impact of the drought is stark. The rapidly retreating river is being replaced by rubbish-strewn sandbanks. Health officials have warned of an increased risk of disease, including hepatitis A and cholera from contaminated water supplies.\n\nJust outside the city, where the black Rio Negro meets the murky brown Solim\u00f5es to form the Amazon river, the drought has exposed a rocky outcrop with human faces carved into the stone. Archaeologists believe the markings could be up to 2,000 years old.\n\nA pontoon dock in the Rio Negro was crowded with cargo, including Honda motorbikes, cleaning products, clothes and grains, after vessel departures were reduced. The port is a hub for supplying remote villages deep in the rainforest.\n\n\u201cWe are trapped in the city,\u201d said Marilene Bonilia, who sat on the dock struggling to sell trinkets to a trickle of arrivals. \u201cWe are suffering.\u201d\n\nEbido Santos, who was supervising the loading of riverboats, said: \u201cIt has been bad before, but never like this.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3be2100f-3ea5-42a2-9523-33e05953705c"}}, {"id": "9e304f20-a2d3-4e77-972a-d91660ee439d", "event_name": "BHP aims to settle over Brazil dam disaster", "blurb": "A venture jointly owned by the miner and Vale faces alleged liabilities in the tens of billions of dollars", "date": "2023-11-0500:00:00.0", "body": "BHP, the world\u2019s largest mining group, has said publicly for the first time that it wants to reach a final settlement over a dam disaster in Brazil worth potentially tens of billions of dollars of liabilities.\n\nThe Australian company is on the hook financially for the collapse of a tailings dam that stored mining waste at the Samarco iron ore complex in November 2015, near the town of Mariana in the south-eastern state of Minas Gerais.\n\nIt killed 19 people and devastated villages and swaths of countryside because of an avalanche of mud that contaminated hundreds of kilometres of waterways.\n\nIn the wake of the accident, which ranks as one of the country\u2019s worst environmental catastrophes, federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit demanding R$155bn ($32bn) in compensation from Samarco and its joint owners, BHP and the Brazilian miner Vale.\n\nBHP\u2019s vice-president for legal affairs for the Americas, Emir Calluf, told the Financial Times that it aimed to soon come to an agreement with public authorities in the South American nation.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to get a final deal in Brazil that settles everything,\u201d said Calluf, adding that negotiations were \u201cpretty advanced\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the right conditions were there and the legal certainty and releases, we would be willing to do a deal by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe executive declined to quantify the possible compensation bill but said a deal could also include further reparation works.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Federal Prosecution Service was not immediately available for comment.\n\nBHP also faces a case in the UK brought by 700,000 claimants seeking compensation for harm to homes and livelihoods. Their lawyers estimated maximum potential damages of \u00a336bn this year.

It denied that a deal in Brazil would mislead shareholders because it was hard to know at the time of the accident its full extent and effects.\n\nThe miner also denied any \u201csweetheart\u201d deal since a settlement would be done through complex technical negotiations, with procedures established by the Brazilian authorities.\n\nRenova, a non-profit foundation set up to carry out repairs and provide financial redress under an initial deal in 2016 between the companies and public authorities, has so far spent nearly R$30.8bn. Funding obligations fall on Samarco but, if it is unable to meet payments, then BHP and Vale are committed to step in.\n\nCalluf said BHP had discussed reaching a potential final settlement with both Vale and Samarco, a 50-50 joint venture between the mining groups.\n\n\u201cSamarco is and will remain the primary party at any settlement on this issue,\u201d said Calluf. \u201cBHP\u2019s role, as well as Vale\u2019s, is to supplement resources that may be needed for the company to fulfil the terms of a settlement \u2014 which will certainly be the case here.\u201d\n\nIn parallel to Renova, Samarco has separately made R$2.6bn in direct compensation payments.\n\nA resolution to outstanding claims from the Mariana disaster would help to turn a page on an episode that tarnished the reputations of the companies and prompted soul-searching in the mining industry.\n\nThe rupture of the Fund\u00e3o dam released 40mn cubic metres of tailings \u2014 byproducts left over from mining that can contain toxic substances \u2014 sparking increased scrutiny over the safety of such structures.\n\nIn 2019, a tailings dam owned by Vale burst near the town of Brumadinho in the same state of Brazil, resulting in 270 deaths.\n\nVale said in a statement on Sunday that renegotiation of the Mariana agreement was ongoing, with meetings scheduled throughout this month: \u201cGiven the complexity of the topic and the intention to seek definitive solutions, it is natural for conversations to be extended.\u201d\n\nThe company stated its \u201ccommitment to repairing the damage caused by the collapse of the Fund\u00e3o dam\u201d and was providing\u00a0support for Renova, through which more than 430,000 people have been compensated.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2c8c4fa5-b1a1-4c99-b984-80c54452c0fc"}}, {"id": "f4182c2f-9f2c-4b6d-8f08-bcf937f8f92e", "event_name": "The brilliance of Brazilian modernism", "blurb": "Join the Bo Bardi party", "date": "2023-11-0300:00:00.0", "body": "One of the most exhilarating gallery experiences you could have had this year was\u00a0the immersive nine-screen video installation of A Marvellous Entanglement, part of the epic Isaac Julien retrospective at Tate Britain.

Brazilian modernism looks organic. It feels born from nature. It\u2019s warm. Most of the\u00a0key practitioners \u2013 including Bo Bardi, Rodrigues and Niemeyer \u2013 created furniture as well as\u00a0buildings (a selection of Niemeyer\u2019s sculptural furniture by Etel can be found at The Invisible Collection).\n\nIn Brazil, the aesthetic lives on. Last year, Zanini de Zanine Caldas, the Rio-based furniture designer, showed The Sound of Wood at R & Company in New\u00a0York, a collection of work marking 20\u00a0years of his studio. De Zanine Caldas established The Museum of Brazilian Chairs in Bahia in 2018 and now, in his mid-40s, is a dynamo of contemporary Brazilian modernism. His work blends indigenous materials \u2013 fibres from the Tucum palm, ip\u00ea and ma\u00e7aranduba wood \u2013 to create pieces that would look at home in any midcentury glass pavilion but also radiate tropical energy. \u201cHis artistic vision beautifully intertwines the past, present and future of Brazilian modernism,\u201d says Zesty Meyers, co-founder of R\u00a0& Company, which showcases the work of 20th- and 21st-century designers. \u201cHis masterful use of native woods\u00a0echoes the legacy of his artistic heritage \u2013 and his distinctive forms and engagement with material thickness and weight reflect an understanding of past innovation, while offering a contemporary experience.\u201d\n\nZanini\u2019s father was Jos\u00e9 Zanine Caldas,\u00a0who defined a new aesthetic with his work in the 1950s. \u201cIt was raw,\u201d says fellow Brazilian furniture designer Claudia Moreira Salles, who is represented by Espasso, a gallery specialising in Brazilian design\u00a0 (including vintage pieces). \u201cHe came from architecture, and worked wood in larger dimensions, creating a more brutalist and less machined style.\u201d Moreira Salles also cites Sergio Rodrigues as creating \u201ciconic\u201d work. \u201cHis Mole chair imprinted modernism with a heavier language through its abundant use of material,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Nordics are more restrained, but Brazilians have so many natural resources.\u201d Espasso founder Carlos Junqueira agrees: \u201cIt represents the DNA of Brazilian modernism \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s traditional but encapsulates the movement with exaggerated shapes, curved features, luxurious comfort and a laid-back but well-crafted appeal.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, when working in Brazil, I was so taken with\u00a0 Rodrigues\u2019s dining chair with hexagonal split-cane panels I asked to visit him. The Oscar chairs debuted in 1956 at the S\u00e3o Paulo Jockey Club and are named after Oscar Niemeyer. I met Rodrigues \u2013 a jovial bear of a man\u00a0with a luxuriant Yosemite Sam moustache \u2013 at\u00a0his studio in Botafogo, Rio. Some of his designs looked like cartoon characters \u2013 the witty lines of the Chifruda armchair always raise a smile. \u201cWhen I\u00a0create a piece,\u201d he told me, \u201cI\u2019m my own client. I\u00a0always think that if I like it then someone else will.\u201d Rodrigues died in 2014 but his work is still celebrated; this month, R & Co opens a show of work that can be\u00a0seen\u00a0until the end of January next year at its TriBeCa\u00a0gallery on White Street.\n\nSome contemporary designers channel Brazilian modernism without being conscious of it. \u201cAs a boy, growing up in Sydney, I was inspired to become an architect by Harry Seidler, Australia\u2019s foremost modernist architect,\u201d says US designer and architect Craig Bassam, one half of the design house BassamFellows. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise at that point how much of Seidler\u2019s work was influenced by his time spent in Brazil. His urbanism was\u00a0shaped by the monumentality of Niemeyer with the\u00a0artful landscape planning of Roberto Burle Marx. Subtly, it has influenced my own furniture designs \u2013 sculptural, organic silhouettes and natural, solid materials with a\u00a0focus on ease and comfort.\u201d\n\nThere are many other Brazilian modernist designers who\u00a0remain underrated compared with their European counterparts, despite their having created some phenomenal\u00a0 work. Carlos Junqueira points to the 1959 Dinamarquesa Chair by Jorge Zalszupin as a masterpiece. It has the kind\u00a0of sleek, future-leaning silhouette that would hold its own against any Gio Ponti, or his Nordic peers. \u201cIts name indicates an inspiration drawn from Danish minimalism,\u201d says Junqueira. \u201cThe thin and lightweight frame tells a story of refined craftsmanship and elegance while slight curves and a reclined seating position respond to the Brazilian casual lifestyle.\u201d\n\nClaudia Moreira Salles singles out the three-legged Tr\u00eas P\u00e9s side chair by Joaquim Tenreiro as a piece that is \u201ciconic and represents Brazilian modernism\u201d. It\u2019s certainly a beauty. And a rare one too. An original will come close to \u00a380,000 at auction. But she has more affection for the work of Zalszupin. \u201cHe had an extremely sophisticated language, but worked in an economical way, with expressiveness of drawing,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I had to choose one piece, I would choose the JZ Tea Trolley. It did not have the rigid structure you\u2019d see from European industrial producers working with large joineries. He arrived in Brazil as an immigrant war refugee; he had to pivot. He has a rich repertoire.\u201d\n\nPartly because of a ban on many exports (rosewood is\u00a0still highly regulated, which prevents a lot of key pieces\u00a0making it out of the country), it is the homes and\u00a0galleries that the Brazilian modernists created that made their name internationally. Everyone knows the names of Niemeyer and landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx who worked so closely with him, even if\u00a0they\u2019ve never visited Brazil.\n\nBut one also has to turn back to Lina Bo Bardi. While Isaac Julien\u2019s nine screens were taking Londoners through a variety of Bo Bardi\u2019s public buildings, Bottega Veneta took people into her most private space \u2013 an elevated glass box in the rainforest, Casa de Vidro, which she built in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1951 and lived in until her death in 1992. The fashion brand was marking 10 years of its presence in Brazil, and invited curator Mari Stockler to create an 11-day programme, installing a diverse selection of work by Brazilian artists at the house as part of Bottega\u2019s ongoing cultural exchange programme, The Square. At the opening, Stockler explained that she was attempting to \u201ccontrast Lina\u2019s objects with works by modern and contemporary artists in an exchange between past, present, and possible futures\u201d.\n\nBo Bardi framed it in slightly more esoteric terms \u2013 a quote that inspired the title of Isaac Julien\u2019s film: \u201cLinear\u00a0time is a western invention; time is not linear, it is\u00a0a\u00a0marvellous entanglement where, at any moment, points can be chosen and solutions invented, without beginning or end,\u201d she said. The sentiment is\u00a0close to science fiction. Which is apt\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Brazilian modernism has always\u00a0been about fantasy and\u00a0optimism.\n\nJoaquim Tenreiro, Masterworks is showing at Carpenters Workshop Gallery, Paris, until 22 December, and in London from May 2024.

We were searching for Nhorinha, a female maned wolf. My guide, Isabela Meniz, turned the antenna to try to catch a signal from the animal\u2019s tracking collar. The faint beeping sound grew louder then faded. The wolf was on the move, somewhere in the gathering dusk.\n\nThis was her territory, deep in the heart of the cerrado, a savannah of dry grasslands that is South America\u2019s second largest biome after the Amazon. When the BBC\u2019s Planet Earth team wanted to film an iconic species for their \u201cDeserts and Grasslands\u201d episode, they came here to Fazenda Trijun\u00e7\u00e3o, to track the elusive maned wolf. An 81,000-acre conservation project, Trijun\u00e7\u00e3o is home to a delightful pousada, or inn, where naturalist guides take guests out into the savannah to see its astonishing bird life, and hopefully the maned wolves that are one of the stars of this week\u2019s episode of Planet Earth III.\n\nIn Brazil, the cerrado is the country\u2019s vacant heart, a grassland of long horizons and huge skies. You can go for miles here without seeing anyone. When I asked Isabela why she loved it here, she answered simply: \u201cThe silences.\u201d\n\nIt was always an unconsidered back country of old ranches, or fazendas, of lives framed by hardship and plaintive country music. But now it has become a landscape under threat, on the front line of habitat loss, as vast tracts of the cerrado are being subjugated to large-scale agriculture \u2014 chiefly the monoculture of soyabeans \u2014 at over twice the rate of the Amazon. Some experts predict it could disappear completely in the next 10 years.\n\nFor now, the cerrado remains home to a profusion of flora and fauna. I watched as birds danced across the grasslands like an unending chorus line; there are 283 species at Trijun\u00e7\u00e3o and the names reflect their glamour \u2014 the helmeted manakin, the glittering-throated emerald, the fork-tailed woodnymph, the point-tailed palmcreeper, the screaming cowbird and red-cowled cardinal.\n\nAmong the mammals are the anteater, jaguar, ocelot and pampas deer. But it is the maned wolf, one of South America\u2019s rarest mammals, that draws processional naturalists and tourists alike. It is a supermodel of the animal kingdom, the most beautiful of canids, shy, slender, fine-boned, with a golden coat and long legs. It would make a leopard look clumsy.\n\nConservation efforts at Trijun\u00e7\u00e3o include a wildlife breeding program, small-scale sustainable ranching, fruit orchards and experimental projects to find crops that suit the soil and the climate without degrading the habitat. Low-impact tourism is at the heart of the project; visitors bring employment to the locals and value to the conservation of wildlife.\n\nWith the retro feel of an old-fashioned ranch house, Pousada Trijun\u00e7\u00e3o is an elegant rustic lodge, all salvaged wood and rich South American fabrics. There is a kitchen producing a flow of hearty meals, a small bar serving excellent caipirinhas and a swimming pool where you can pass long afternoons dreaming of wolves.\n\nListed in most compendiums as endangered due to habitat loss, the maned wolf are secretive creatures, ghosting through the undergrowth. The Brazilian conservation charity, On\u00e7afari, which has a base at Trijun\u00e7\u00e3o, tracks them to better understand their movements, lives and challenges. Morning and evening I went out with two of the charity\u2019s young naturalists in their open safari jeep, hoping for a glimpse of the Greta Garbo of the natural world.\n\nNhorinha is the alpha female of the fazenda territory. Hers has been a complicated existence that reads rather like a soap opera \u2014 serial mates, estranged offspring. Though most maned wolf are monogamous, Nhorinha refuses to be tied down by the wolf patriarchy. She is known to have taken at least three mates, much to the approval of the naturalists who track her.\n\nRumours about her seemed to have a life of their own, like celebrity gossip \u2014 that she had returned to a previous mate; that one of her female offspring was consorting with one of her previous males; that she was pregnant, father unknown; that she was dead, some unfortunate accident. We spent three hours tracking her, listening to the crescendo of beeps, then losing her again, doubling back, scanning the grasslands with binoculars, feeling just a tad like celebrity stalkers.\n\nAnd suddenly she was there, as we came round a bend \u2014 trotting across the track, as elegantly as a ballerina crossing a stage. She paused and turned her head to look at us. She was beautiful. But in that moment I wondered what she saw when she looked back at us, the silhouette of the jeep against the last light, the figures inside scrambling for their cameras and binoculars.\n\nThen she was gone, the tip of her white tail disappearing into the long grass, a determined survivor in this most extraordinary of landscapes.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f03a4dca-dadb-44de-9f93-3f8b33ddcea4"}}, {"id": "e85b2930-c664-4925-aebb-521b62807055", "event_name": "Brazil is taking worrying steps away from clean politics", "blurb": "Allowing political parties to buy boats and planes out of public funds is just one of Bras\u00edlia\u2019s moves away from accountability", "date": "2023-10-2100:00:00.0", "body": "The political class in Bras\u00edlia is up to its old tricks. A decade after a vast corruption scandal shook the nation, a string of recent moves by Congress and the Supreme Court is reigniting concerns about transparency, accountability and impunity in Latin America\u2019s largest nation.\n\nFront and centre has been a so-called \u201celectoral reform\u201d, spearheaded by Arthur Lira, speaker of the lower house. The legislation, which sailed through the lower house last month and now awaits a Senate vote, has been sold as simple tweaks and adjustments to the electoral system.\n\nBut the details tell a different story. If passed, the legislation would permit politicians to disclose their finances only after campaigns, not during as is currently required. It would also allow parties to use public electoral funds to buy or rent cars, boats and planes, as well as pay for their maintenance and fuel.\n\nAnd perhaps, most significantly, it could enable a kind of \u201cvote buying\u201d. Under current rules, politicians have to disclose every individual who is contracted to work on campaigns. But under the proposed legislation, politicians would be permitted to hire people through employment agencies, without disclosing the names of individuals.\n\n\u201cPoliticians will use these companies to legalise all kinds of payments during the campaign,\u201d said Bruno Carazza, a professor at the Dom Cabral Foundation. \u201cIt is a measure against transparency. Politicians will pay citizens for their votes and declare this money was paid to companies to hire campaign workers.\u201d\n\nIn parallel to the reform, Congress is also pushing through an \u201camnesty bill\u201d that could erase fines worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which political parties generated by failing to comply with electoral rules on quotas for female and non-white candidates.\n\nThe nation\u2019s association for public prosecutors warned that the twin pieces of legislation represented a \u201cserious step backward\u201d and would \u201cimpact the transparency of Brazilian democracy\u201d.\n\nAdriana Ventura, one of just a handful of lawmakers to vote against the electoral reform, put it more starkly: \u201cWhat we are talking about here is an increase in impunity for those who do illegal things with money.\u201d\n\nQuestionable electoral activities are not the only red flag. Consecutive actions by Supreme Court judges have signalled there is little or no appetite for corruption investigations involving the political class.\n\nGilmar Mendes, one of the court\u2019s 11 justices, last month shelved a Federal Police investigation into a suspected bribery case involving political allies of House Speaker Lira. The judge reasoned the probe undermined Lira\u2019s right as a lawmaker to parliamentary immunity.\n\nAround the same time, almost out of the blue, Dias Toffoli \u2014 another top judge \u2014 decided to nullify vast amounts of evidence obtained in the decade-old Lava Jato, or car wash, corruption investigation. He then ordered the investigation of prosecutors who had struck the plea bargains to obtain the evidence in question.\n\nRunning over several years, the Lava Jato probe revealed a vast contracts-for-kickbacks network involving billions of dollars and scores of senior politicians and businesspeople. Many received jail sentences and, at the time, the investigation was credited with tackling Brazil\u2019s culture of political impunity. The US Treasury called it \u201cthe largest foreign bribery case in history\u201d.\n\nIts legacy, however, was deeply tarnished by revelations about prosecutorial over-reach and political bias, including in an investigation of now president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. The leftwing leader spent almost two years in prison as a result of the probe. His conviction was later annulled by the supreme court.\n\nIn his ruling last month, Toffoli repeated familiar points that Lava Jato \u201cdisrespected due legal process and acted with bias\u201d. His decision, however, to disinter a long-buried investigation only to put a further nail into its coffin sent a clear message: the days of free-ranging investigations are over. To critics, it was another sign the court was blowing with the political winds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in another round of reversing all the decisions that shook the country during Lava Jato,\u201d said Carazza. \u201cThe political system already took a lot of measures to restore its position and now we have another chapter with the Supreme Court disregarding all the evidence.\u201d\n\nA report by the OECD last week said Brazil needed \u201curgent key reforms\u201d in the fight against corruption, highlighting the \u201climited level of enforcement\u201d, de facto impunity and perceived threats to the independence of prosecutors in foreign bribery cases.\n\nMatias Spektor, a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, said that the \u201cfight against corruption will no longer be a dominant theme in Brazilian politics\u201d.\n\n\u201cOrder, as it were, has been restored. And this restoration has entailed the curtailing of the powers to investigate and prosecute professional politicians,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he added that much of the blame for this was due to the \u201cquestionable or illegal and politically motivated\u201d actions of the Lava Jato task force. \u201cIn the end, this did enormous damage to the cause of clean politics.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6bb7c8a7-1375-479f-89d9-048da59f5dec"}}, {"id": "759d1032-ac9e-4c6a-b27e-5d4148dbfd48", "event_name": "Companies face intensifying scrutiny over greenwashing", "blurb": "New investigation shines light on an obscure corner of the green debt market in Brazil", "date": "2023-10-1600:00:00.0", "body": "Before we begin today, I want to point out this research featured in the FT yesterday that found more Americans are aligning their political views with their investment holdings.\n\n\u201cThe politically driven divergence of how Americans invest is striking and in sharp contrast to the overall convergence of portfolio composition that one would expect,\u201d the researchers found. This is especially true given the benefits of low-cost index investing. \u201cIt raises the question of what causes this divergence and what the consequences might be,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nFor today, I\u2019ve delved into a new Greenpeace report on the green bond market. An obscure segment of the market in Brazil could be in trouble, according to its investigation. Thanks for reading \u2014 Patrick Temple-West\n\nAs companies are becoming increasingly involved in green financial products \u2014 from carbon offsets to green bonds \u2014 the threats they face from greenwashing allegations are increasing as well.\n\nThrough August, green and sustainable bond funds recorded $24.5bn of inflows globally, beating the $22bn inflow for all of 2022, according to an October report from Bank of America. This demand came amid higher borrowing costs globally and a slowdown in inflows for conventional funds, BofA said. Green and sustainable bond funds now comprise 12 per cent of the wider fund market, up from 10.6 per cent at the end of 2022, the bank said.\n\nAs investors gobble up green debt, companies and their underwriters are under scrutiny. The latest investigation into questionable green debt comes from Unearthed, Greenpeace UK\u2019s investigative journalism division, which shone a light on an obscure corner of the green debt market in Brazil.\n\nIn recent years the Brazilian government has popularised Agribusiness Receivables Certificates (CRA), which are debt securities issued by a securitisation company backed by agribusiness credit rights, according to a definition by the IMF. But there is little public information available about them.\n\nGreenpeace\u2019s Unearthed investigation found that funds raised by CRAs were financing controversial companies including deforesters, land grabbers and ranchers accused of slave labour in Brazil.\n\nIn October 2021 Caramuru, a Brazilian processing company for soy, corn, sunflowers and canola, issued \u00a356.4mn in a green deal structured as a CRA. And the CRA issuing document lists 310 suppliers that Caramuru said it would work with.\n\nUnearthed investigated those suppliers and found some controversial people involved, for example people and organisations listed as potential suppliers.\n\nIn a response, Caramuru said none of the company\u2019s sustainability commitments were violated by the deal and that none of the green CRA funds were bought from suppliers linked to the Unearthed allegations.\n\n\u201cThe producers who supplied Caramuru complied with [its] sustainability policy, [and] did not put the credibility of the green CRA\u2019s operations at risk,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nNot all of the suppliers listed in the offering documents ended up working with the company, Caramuru said. \u201cIt is possible that soy was not acquired from places with issues of illegal deforestation or land grabbing, nor from farms with work similar to slavery,\u201d Caramuru added.\n\nThe CRA deal was underwritten by UBS. In a statement, the Swiss bank said it did not comment on client relationships, but added that it offered examples on agricultural sector standards on its website.\n\nUnearthed also investigated green CRAs issued by other Brazilian companies and international banks.\n\nSustainability-linked bonds have provisions that increase borrowing costs for companies if they fail to hit specified green targets. While initially touted as the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in impact investing, SLBs have not achieved widespread use by impact bond fund managers, Morningstar said earlier this year. SLB issuance has dropped 44 per cent to $12bn this year, according to Morgan Stanley. \u201cWe think investors want SLBs to work, but challenges with the structure amidst high greenwashing risk are deterring [companies],\u201d the Wall Street bank said in August.\n\nIncreasingly, environmental activists are not the only ones investigating green bonds. Regulators are on the hunt too.\n\nIn May, the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority launched an investigation of the market for sustainable loans. The FCA started interviewing bankers and borrowers about loans that potentially reward borrowers with lower rates but fail to have a significant environmental impact.\n\nAnd this month, the European Parliament approved new standards to fight greenwashing in the bond market. All companies that choose a green label for debt will be required to disclose more information about their proceeds. And green bonds should align with a company\u2019s overall transition away from carbon emissions, according to the EU rules, which are expected to come into effect next year.\n\nThe greenwashing challenges with green bonds fall primarily on banks, which underwrite the debt, but are also big issuers themselves.\n\n\u201cFrom the banks\u2019 perspective, they can just view [green bonds] as fee collecting activities,\u201d Aaron Yoon, a professor at Northwestern University in Chicago who researches green bonds, told me. \u201cHowever, we have to note that they are also signatories of all sorts of ESG-related initiatives.\u201d\n\nBanks would be wise to start following up with companies about the sustainability of the proceeds from green bonds, Yoon said. \u201cSooner or later, the banks will also be scrutinised.\u201d (Patrick Temple-West)\n\nIn the mood for something sweet and crunchy?

The sentiment \u2014 a nod to Brazil\u2019s chaotic complexity at times \u2014 is doubly true for doing business in the Amazon rainforest, the lion\u2019s share of which sits within the borders of the Latin American country.\n\nWith the return of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva to the presidency this year, environmental protection has shot to the forefront of the political agenda \u2014 and with it a rush to seize the commercial opportunities accompanying the green transition.\n\nMost exuberant has been the market for voluntary carbon credits. Covering more than 400mn hectares, the Brazilian section of the Amazon biome offers an unparalleled opportunity for developers to generate carbon credits via the preservation of standing forest or the reforestation of denuded lands.\n\nThese credits are then typically sold to major international companies that are seeking to offset their own emissions, with prices negotiated between the buyer and seller. The potential for the market has left many breathless, with one study last year optimistically forecasting potential revenues of $120bn by 2030. If done right, proponents argue, the market can also aid in the fight against climate change by preserving ecosystems that store carbon dioxide or by reforesting.\n\nBut doing business in the rainforest is a fraught endeavour. At best, rules and regulations are opaque and land rights are complicated and require serious due diligence. At its worst, the region is lawless.\n\nThese complexities have been laid bare by a deepening scandal in the huge Amazonian state of Par\u00e1, where prosecutors have filed lawsuits against three carbon credit projects.\n\nThe investigators allege the little-known companies behind the projects had seized public land to use in their bid to generate carbon credits and profits. In local parlance, the alleged offence is grilagem, or land grabbing.\n\nThen an investigation by local media group Globo reported that not only had the credits been certified by Verra, the key industry standards body, but they had been sold to a host of prominent western companies, including Boeing, Air France and Liverpool Football Club.\n\nThese companies are not a target of the lawsuits. Key individuals named in the filings said they would co-operate with the court to correct any potential irregularity.\u00a0And in a statement, Verra said it took the claims \u201cvery seriously\u201d and that three projects were currently under review. Boeing said it was determining the next steps, but that it bought \u201cthrough a globally recognised agency to access projects that are registered with three widely recognised standard-setting bodies\u201d. Air France and Liverpool FC did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe involvement of the multinational buyers raised the profile of the issue. But non-governmental organisations have long complained about project developers in general and, in particular, the use of aggressive behaviour towards local and indigenous communities in order to secure land.\n\nMuch of the issue stems from the region\u2019s messy land ownership claims. It is also complicated by the fact that communities can often occupy land for generations without any proper paperwork. The market requires deep due diligence.\n\nAn investigation by Hernandez Lerner & Miranda Advocacia, a law firm, fuelled further concerns about the integrity of the market and the ubiquity of land grabbing. Using geospatial imagery, the firm analysed 56 carbon credit projects in the Amazon and found that 33 of them overlapped either partially or totally with public lands.\n\nThe lack of clear rules for the voluntary carbon market means there is \u201clittle to no public oversight\u201d, said Mario Braga, a political risk analyst at Control Risks. \u201cCompanies [buying credits] often rely on international best practices and limited third-party verification. Especially in the Amazon, some peculiarities can represent significant obstacles, such as widespread land-grabbing.\u201d\n\nThe situation, however, could improve in the coming months as Brazil\u2019s Congress moves to create a legal framework for a mandatory carbon market.

Petrobras has appealed against the decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right of the Brazilian people to understand their mineral wealth, whether on or offshore,\u201d Silveira said in an interview when asked about proposed drilling in the Foz de Amazonas basin, an area 175km from the northern coast which forms part of the Equatorial Margin. He said part of Brazil\u2019s oil revenue is sent to a \u201csocial fund which finances health, education and the energy transition\u201d.\n\nBrazil is projected to rise three places to become the world\u2019s sixth biggest oil producer by 2030 if its current projects are realised. But opening up the coastal strip off the Amazon could unlock reserves containing up to 30bn barrels of oil equivalent, turning it into the fourth biggest oil producer behind the US, Saudi Arabia and Russia, according to government plans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any contradiction between the exploration of oil and gas and the clear, objective, safe and firm decision\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009to carry out the energy transition in a just and inclusive way,\u201d said Silveira, a centrist politician and former businessman who was in New York during UN climate week to discuss Brazil\u2019s green energy plans. \u201cThe reality of the world is that we still need fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nAny oil drilling carried out at the mouth of the Amazon basin or along the adjoining coast would abide by strict rules to avoid environmental damage, he added.\n\nSilveira said Brazil was making the case to the US, China and European powers that a climate transition had to be fair for all members of society. Rich nations, he added, had to \u201cunderstand that there is no peace without [social] inclusion, there is no peace when you have poverty and hunger\u201d.\n\nA recent study by Boston Consulting Group concluded that Brazil\u2019s high proportion of renewable power and interconnected grid made it one of the best-placed countries for the production of green hydrogen, but said tax and investment incentives were needed to compete with other countries.\n\nCiting official statistics, Silveira said \u201cthe world average is 28 per cent clean and renewable energy and we have 88 per cent\u201d.\n\nBrazil would find it difficult to fund large government subsidies for green hydrogen, as some wealthy nations are doing, because of the need to focus scarce resources on health, education and public security, he said. But the government would try to find legal and regulatory incentives to help the nascent industry and did not rule out tax perks to drive decarbonisation.\n\nBrazil is also betting big on biofuels, hoping to exploit further the potential of a bioethanol programme derived from sugarcane which uses waste products to increase efficiency and reduce emissions. Biofuels already help power the country\u2019s vehicles and could be used in aviation fuel.\n\n\u201cThose who invested in second-generation ethanol in Brazil, in decarbonised ethanol, are making money and being successful,\u201d Silveira said.\n\nBut the minister said he remained concerned about protectionism by wealthy nations, which he said would only hinder social inclusion in the shift to clean energy.\n\n\u201cThe [trade] barriers put up by developed countries to the countries of the global south won\u2019t resolve the problem of the energy transition.\u201d\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f13aef43-ca58-49d6-b825-891e54670910"}}, {"id": "4edf67af-d0b2-4e64-a547-00630e8f98d1", "event_name": "South American leaders issue ultimatum on EU trade pact ", "blurb": "Paraguay\u2019s president says Mercosur will end talks with Brussels if deal is not finalised by December 6", "date": "2023-09-2500:00:00.0", "body": "The EU must finalise a long-delayed trade treaty with the Mercosur bloc of South American nations by December 6 or the Latin Americans will walk away and negotiate with Asian countries instead, Paraguay\u2019s president Santiago Pe\u00f1a has said.\n\nExpressing frustration with negotiations that have dragged on for more than 20 years, Pe\u00f1a told the Financial Times that the time had come for European leaders to take a political decision on whether they wanted a deal with the four full Mercosur member nations \u2014 Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. \u201cThis is no longer a technical issue,\u201d he said.\n\nA treaty was agreed in principle in 2019 but the EU has not enacted the deal because some member states, including France, want additional environmental commitments from South America before signing. The Mercosur nations have rejected this as protectionism from European nations scared of competition from South American beef and wine exports.\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in July that a Mercosur deal was \u201cwithin reach\u201d but progress since has been minimal and diplomats say the window of opportunity is closing. Argentina holds presidential elections next month and the libertarian economist leading the polls, Javier Milei, has pledged to dissolve Mercosur and freeze relations with Brazil if elected.\n\nPe\u00f1a, who was in New York for the UN General Assembly, said he had agreed there with Brazil\u2019s president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva that if an EU trade deal had not been finalised by the time Lula handed over the rotating Mercosur presidency to him in early December, Pe\u00f1a would break off the negotiations.\n\n\u201cEither we close by December 6 or we don\u2019t close,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said in an interview. \u201cI am the one who is going to take the presidency afterwards and I told [Lula] \u2018Enough is enough\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is someone who can close this deal, it\u2019s Lula\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it will be this year, or if not, it won\u2019t happen at all,\u201d he added. \u201cI am super firm about this. Super firm. We either do it now or we don\u2019t do it at all.\u201d\n\nThe Paraguayan president, who took power last month for a five-year term, said Mercosur had other trade deals in the pipeline with the United Arab Emirates and Singapore. \u201cWith Singapore, we will close a deal in two months,\u201d he added. \u201cI can assure you it will be very fast.\u201d\n\nA former finance minister and central bank board member who studied in the US, Pe\u00f1a has ambitious plans to catapult Paraguay\u2019s economy into the ranks of South America\u2019s small group of high-income nations, such as Chile and Uruguay. His conservative Colorado party controls congress and has dominated Paraguayan politics for most of the past 75 years.\n\nHe is confident that the South American beef and soyabean exporter can achieve an investment-grade rating for its modest external debt within a couple of years as it establishes a solid record. \u201cOur conversation with the credit rating agencies is: \u2018What more do you need?\u2019 and they say: \u2018We need time to see the consistency of [economic performance],\u201d he said.\n\nParaguay is one of the dwindling band of countries that has full diplomatic relations with Taiwan and it is Taipei\u2019s geographically largest ally. Paraguay\u2019s farmers have questioned the alliance because it precludes exports to the vast Chinese market but Pe\u00f1a expressed strong commitment to Taiwan.\n\n\u201cThe future of Paraguay is not food. The future of Paraguay is industry,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we have to think how we are going to develop industrially. Who is going to help us get closer to an industrial future: a giant which will only buy food from us\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009or Taiwan, which is going to help us improve, just as they did themselves?\u201d\n\nParaguay has sent about 600 engineers to Taiwan to study advanced electronics and Taipei has helped establish a technical university in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay\u2019s capital. Pe\u00f1a wants to leverage the enormous supply of cheap renewable electricity from the giant Itaip\u00fa dam on the border with Brazil to power a growing manufacturing sector for export.\n\nBrazil and Paraguay are renegotiating part of the Itaip\u00fa treaty and Pe\u00f1a hopes to win agreement to issue tens of billions of dollars of green debt secured against Itaip\u00fa\u2019s future income to use for infrastructure and development projects, now that the dam\u2019s construction cost has been paid off. Funds would be split equally between the two nations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a huge investment potential\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009$100bn. The numbers are gigantic,\u201d the president said of the debt issuance.\n\nPe\u00f1a also has ambitious plans to build new roads across his vast, landlocked nation to boost the economy. Construction is already under way on the final stretch of a new highway running across the central Chaco region, linking it to Argentina in the west and Brazil in the east. Once this is completed in about two years, it will open up a new trade route from Brazil\u2019s Atlantic coast to the Pacific port of Antofagasta in Chile.\n\nPe\u00f1a, who at 44 is one of the region\u2019s youngest leaders, said he wanted Paraguay to \u201cleapfrog\u201d in its growth and leave behind an image of being landlocked and isolated. \u201cParaguay is on an ascending curve but I want to steepen the curve,\u201d he said. \u201cThe image of Paraguay is very different to the reality.

Then came the chorus \u2014 \u201cLula, resign!\u201d \u2014 as the crowd voiced their distaste for Brazil\u2019s leftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\nThe group had gathered outside a convention centre in the eastern city of Belo Horizonte for an extravaganza that organisers had touted, with obvious exaggeration, as the \u201cbiggest conservative event in the world\u201d.\n\nKnown as CPAC \u2014 or the Conservative Political Action Conference \u2014 the spectacle is an import from the American right that has taken hold among Brazil\u2019s mix of conservative, evangelical and far-right communities.\n\nDuring the previous presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain turned populist politician, CPAC grew into a kind of Carnival for the right. Instead of skimpy clothes and glitter, there are Brazil flags and jerseys. Instead of samba, there are lectures on the dangers of gender ideology and the importance of Jesus.\n\nThis year, however, the swaggering exuberance of the event had all but faded. With Bolsonaro out of office and banned from contesting elections, and the left once again in ascendance, any sense of triumphalism had vanished. In its place were fear and loathing.\n\n\u201cLula\u2019s government is marked by hatred, resentment and revenge,\u201d said Julia Zanatta, a federal lawmaker with Bolsonaro\u2019s increasingly far-right Liberal party. \u201cAnd the decisions of the judiciary have shown that against us opposition, rightwing and conservative politicians, anything goes.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Lula \u2014 who is enjoying buoyant approval ratings despite his narrow election victory last year \u2014 much of the angst at CPAC was directed at Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court. In the tumultuous days before and after the polls last October, the court took a firm stance in cracking down on hate speech and disinformation, often disseminated by far-right networks.\n\nThen, when thousands of pro-Bolsonaro radicals stormed and vandalised the country\u2019s political institutions in January, the court moved up a gear, arresting thousands and charging hundreds. Just a week before CPAC began, it delivered a harsh first conviction: 17 years to a rioter caught vandalising the Senate. The court took the view that the riots were an attempted coup.\n\nAlthough the insurrection was widely condemned by Brazilian society, the populist right has attempted to portray the judicial response as political persecution. A separate decision by Brazil\u2019s electoral court in June to strip Bolsonaro of his political rights for eight years, after he was convicted of abuse of power while in office, has fuelled the perceived sense of injustice.\n\n\u201cWith every step I take I risk prosecution,\u201d said Cristiano Caporezzo, a state lawmaker who spoke at CPAC on Saturday. \u201cIn fact, I have already received a complaint from public prosecutors, alleging transphobia for the simple reason that I will never agree that a biological man, who believes he is a woman, will compete in any female sport.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the weekend, many of the speakers urged the crowd not to be afraid and to start rebuilding the conservative movement. But the sense of unease was palpable. Many attendees expressed discomfort with having to disclose their names and personal details as part of registration.\n\nTickets were initially $50 per head, but a week before the event organisers waived this fee and offered reimbursements. The 1,500-capacity venue, nonetheless, never appeared more than two-thirds full.\n\nIn previous years, the event attracted a slew of speakers from the American right, including Republican congressmen and members of Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle. Last year, Javier Milei \u2014 the frontrunner in forthcoming presidential elections in Argentina \u2014 was a prominent guest. This year they all steered clear.\n\n\u201cWe are afraid to speak, afraid to post online, afraid to say his name\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. the name of [supreme court justice] Alexandre de Moraes,\u201d said Patricia Schmidt, who travelled from the southern city of Curitiba to attend the event.\n\nBruno Carazza, a political analyst and professor at the Dom Cabral Foundation in Belo Horizonte, said the movement was in a \u201cdefensive position\u201d since Bolsonaro\u2019s defeat and the riots in January, which had tarnished the image of the populist right among the broader population.\n\n\u201cIt is a difficult time for them. They are now trying to mobilise themselves and create a plan for the next few years.\u201d\n\nIndeed, municipal elections next year and federal polls in 2026 were weighing on the minds of the more senior politicians in attendance.\n\nRomeu Zema, the rightwing governor of the state of Minas Gerais \u2014 where Belo Horizonte is located \u2014 took to the stage to deafening applause and chanting of his name.\n\n\u201cWe need to participate, we need to fight. We have municipal elections next year and we have to find good candidates and get them to run,\u201d said Zema, a polished, articulate former businessman, who is widely expected to contest the presidency in 2026.\n\nThe speech was interrupted midway, however, by a heckler lambasting the state\u2019s pandemic-era vaccine requirements and Zema was forced unceremoniously offstage. Even at this unique reunion of the Brazilian right, opinions were not united.\n\nAdditional reporting by Emily Costa", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0aeb301f-c331-48fb-9b5d-40da512de504"}}, {"id": "2633059a-294b-45f9-9dbf-c5b31386e6af", "event_name": "Brazil aims to raise $2bn from debut sustainable bond sale", "blurb": "Green debt issuance will be a test of investor appetite for Lula\u2019s environmental agenda ", "date": "2023-09-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil is seeking to raise about $2bn from its first sustainable sovereign bond, in a test of international investor enthusiasm for the green agenda of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\nThe South American nation hopes to finalise the inaugural debt issuance before the end of 2023, according to its finance ministry, with the proceeds earmarked for ecological and social purposes.\n\nLula\u2019s leftwing administration is looking to rehabilitate the country\u2019s environmental credentials on the global stage, following isolationist policies and a rise in deforestation of the Amazon rainforest under predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nFinance minister Fernando Haddad said at an event in New York this week that while the size of the bond had yet to be determined, there was an expectation of raising about R$10bn ($2bn).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important development that puts sustainability into the everyday thinking of the bureaucracy,\u201d said Viktor Szabo, emerging market portfolio manager at asset manager Abrdn. \u201cIt\u2019s part of Lula\u2019s ambitious agenda and a moment we\u2019ve been waiting for following the reluctance of the previous administration.\u201d\n\nBrazil has been relatively slow to enter the burgeoning sustainable bond market compared with regional peers. It will become the eighth country in Latin America to issue a bond with a sustainability label after similar deals by Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru.\n\nBras\u00edlia has mandated investment banks and held roadshows in London, New York and Boston in recent days to outline the proposals and gauge interest.\n\nExact terms such as interest rate and maturity have yet to be confirmed, but final adjustments are likely in the coming days, national treasury secretary Rog\u00e9rio Ceron told the Financial Times. An eventual aim is the creation of a reference yield curve to stimulate further sustainable debt sales by private sector borrowers, he added.\n\n\u201cThe first major objective is to help bring competitive funding to enable the ecological transition in Brazil,\u201d said Ceron. \u201cWe are fully ready to issue as soon as a suitable market window arises\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there are good conditions for it to happen this year\u201d.\n\nCarlos Carranza, an emerging markets debt portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, said he thought \u201cappetite will be high\u201d.\n\n\u201cBrazil is very important for investors, particularly on the environmental side when you think about the Amazon,\u201d Carranza said.\u00a0\u201cThe concerns relate to execution risk in the medium term \u2014 investors will be watching this very closely. But they are off to a very good start.\u201d\n\nDuring the first eight months of Lula\u2019s mandate beginning on January 1, deforestation rates in the Amazon fell 48 per cent, according to official data, as authorities clamped down on illegal loggers and miners.\n\nAnother attraction was the low proportion of Brazilian debt available in foreign currency, Carranza added. Most of the country\u2019s outstanding public borrowing of R$6.1tn is funded by domestic savers in reais.\n\nBras\u00edlia recently outlined a framework for sustainable bonds tied to UN development goals, with the aim of financing areas ranging from pollution control and food security to clean transport and renewable energy.\n\nThe environment will be the main focus, and specific projects could include reforestation, anti-deforestation and green hydrogen initiatives, said Ceron. Beneficiaries of the first fundraising are due to be selected shortly.\n\nGraham Stock, senior emerging market sovereign strategist at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, said a 10-year maturity was likely for the initial bond sale: \u201cThe very explicit goal here is to create a benchmark for corporate issuers [so] that\u2019s the most sensible.\u201d\n\nGiven the usual new issue premium, he estimated that the yield would be slightly above Brazil\u2019s existing dollar bonds, coming in around 6.7 or 6.8 per cent for a 10-year term.\n\n\u201cWe hope to see allocation [of proceeds] to the environmental agency for its efforts to tackle deforestation, but the pricing of the bond is not likely to be materially affected by what projects the government sets out,\u201d added Stock.\n\nLatin America\u2019s largest economy has performed better than expected so far this year and as inflation has dropped, the central bank has begun to cut interest rates.\n\nHowever, investors and analysts point out macroeconomic risks. These include potential hawkish moves by the US Federal Reserve putting pressure on emerging market interest rates, deceleration in Chinese growth and the implementation of new rules for the public accounts under Lula allowing greater public spending.\n\n\u201cThe new green issuance needs to come with an attractive premium over current [hard currency] bonds to stimulate investor appetite, especially given the focus on the new fiscal framework in Brazil,\u201d said Liam Spillane, head of emerging markets debt at Aviva Investors.\n\nThe proportion of debt in Latin America and the Caribbean that carried a sustainable label rose from 8 per cent to 21 per cent in the three years to 2022, according to the non-profit Climate Bonds Initiative. Chile and Mexico are the largest cumulative issuers in the category.\n\nBrazil meanwhile ranks first regionally for both corporate green bonds, which raise money for\u00a0climate and biodiversity projects, and sustainability-linked bonds, which tie the interest rate to hitting certain targets, according to CBI. Companies there sold $7.2bn of sustainable debt in 2022.\n\nChile\u2019s government, which has issued more than $30bn in sustainable debt, became the first country in the world to tie the interest rate on its debt to climate goals last year, including cutting carbon emissions by 2030.\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f7d46dc4-3b88-4864-b0f2-090b98e548e4"}}, {"id": "530c6426-ac25-4971-809a-3c4244744465", "event_name": "Fernando Haddad: Brazil\u2019s plans to transform our green economy", "blurb": "Despite the challenges, we see our ecological transformation proposal as an opportunity for Brazilians", "date": "2023-09-1800:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is finance minister of Brazil\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that we found our country in tatters when we took office less than a year ago. Growth was decelerating, debt trends were worrying, to say the least, and real interest rates were the highest in the world. Perhaps even more important, the social fabric of the Brazilian society needed urgent reknitting together after the new administration headed by president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva faced a direct, violent attack on Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\nThose first stormy months are now behind us. We have initiated a cycle of growth and productivity-enhancing reforms, while making efforts to recover the Brazilian people\u2019s faith in democratic solutions to our many economic and social challenges. But our work is only just beginning. Looking ahead, we now have our sights set on an ambitious and comprehensive plan for ecological transformation.\n\nBrazil already stands out as a world leader in the green economy. Ninety-two per cent of our electricity comes from renewable sources and, despite rising deforestation under the previous government, much of our native vegetation is still standing. Like several other countries, we recognise that fulfilling our Paris Agreement commitment to a net zero economy will be challenging. Our ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to reduce carbon emissions are currently set at 37 per cent by 2025 and 50 per cent by 2030, with a view to finally achieve net zero by 2050. Ultimately, we see decarbonisation and diversification from fossil fuels not as a cost but as an opportunity for creating jobs, raising income and improving the lives of millions of Brazilians.\n\nUnder the leadership of President Lula, and in close co-operation with my colleague Marina Silva, minister of the environment, we are now proposing a new prospect for the country: a comprehensive transformation of our economy and society through greener infrastructure, sustainable agriculture, reforestation, circular economy, increased use of technology in productive processes and climate adaptation. We are committed to sharing these ongoing experiences and helping other countries carry out their green transitions.\n\nOur plan is already under way. It differs from America\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which mobilised a vast amount of budget resources to distribute across myriad sectors. Instead ours will work as a mosaic of regulatory and tax policies that will be approved by Congress in a gradual yet intensive manner.\n\nThe carbon market, our first landmark measure, will follow the steps of the EU Emissions Trading System. This project is universal in scope and applies to all production units emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year. A majority of its newly generated revenues will be allocated to research and development. Furthermore, this new market will protect indigenous and traditional communities, imposing solid rules for profit redistribution. In terms of forest protection, we are strengthening systems of control and monitoring while promoting forest concessions to private partners, linking agriculture financing with better environmental standards.\n\nForeign investors who want to decarbonise their production chain and invest in clean innovation will be very welcome in helping us accelerate this new phase of Brazilian development. Beyond traditional exports, productivity and innovation are set to become the key to reducing our emissions while creating great investment opportunities and millions of high-quality, well-paying jobs.\n\nImportantly, our plan will be underpinned by a solid fiscal and regulatory basis. Within the past eight months, we have approved a modern fiscal rule which has reassured domestic and international economic agents of our commitment to reining in deficits. Furthermore, we are close to completing a long-anticipated but never-delivered tax reform in line with best international practices. The improving macroeconomic conditions are an early reflection of our reform agenda and are set to last. So are our environmental achievements.

The customer opens a mobile banking app, scans the image and taps \u201cconfirm\u201d. The money lands in seconds.\n\nAmid a boom in financial technology launches across Latin America, that have brought basic banking services to millions for the first time, Pix has a strong claim to rank among the most impactful innovations.\n\nTo use it, an account with a bank, a fintech or a digital wallet provider is required. The service is mainly accessed using smartphones.\n\nIt is free for individuals and about two-thirds of the Brazilian population \u2014 some 140mn people \u2014 have used the app since it was launched by the country\u2019s central bank in November 2020.\n\nPix is now the most common form of payment in the region\u2019s largest economy by number of transactions, accounting for 29 per cent of transfers in 2022, according to central bank data on non-cash methods.\n\nThis month, it hit a single-day record of 153mn transactions that moved R$76bn ($15.3bn).\n\nMostly used for sending relatively small amounts, the digital tool is credited with boosting financial inclusion and cutting the cost of doing business for Brazil\u2019s large informal workforce.\n\n\u201cMany people in the low-income bracket, small enterprises or micro-entrepreneurs rely a lot on Pix,\u201d says Ceres Lisboa, senior analyst at credit rating agency Moody\u2019s. \u201cIt brought more people into the financial system.\u201d\n\nGlobally, Pix ranks as the second most-used real-time electronic transfer system, only after India\u2019s United Payments Interface, according to a report by ACI Worldwide.\n\nIt was developed as a public sector solution to the shortcomings of the traditional fund transfer methods offered by Brazil\u2019s banking sector. These often charge a fee, do not settle instantly, and only operate during working hours. Pix is available 24/7.\n\nAngelo Duarte, head of the department of competition and financial market structure at the Banco Central do Brasil, says that, while Brazil lagged behind other countries in adopting a fast payment system, Pix \u201cended up becoming a leader in number of transactions. All of us here at the central bank were surprised by the speed of adoption\u201d.\n\nOne aim of Pix was to reduce the use of cash and its associated costs across a vast territory such as Brazil\u2019s, explains Duarte. In the process, it helped expand financial services to consumers who previously went underserved.\n\n\u201cInstitutions \u2014 whether fintechs or traditional banks \u2014 started to know these people better in terms of income [and], after a while, began to offer them credit, insurance and investment products,\u201d he says.\n\nProponents say the tool has also widened access to online shopping, since many Brazilian ecommerce sites do not accept debit cards.\n\nIt is not the only initiative to shake up payments in Brazil, however. WhatsApp launched a money transfer tool in the country in 2020, but it was temporarily suspended by regulators on concerns including competition and data privacy. Officials reject the notion that this was in order to favour the subsequent launch of Pix months later.\n\nStill, to the taxpayer, Pix has proven relatively cheap: costing $4mn to develop and $8mn to run in 2022, according to the BCB.\n\nAll institutions with 500,000-plus customers must now offer Pix and, while it is free for consumers, charges can be made for businesses. Even so, for taxi drivers and street vendors, it typically works out cheaper than using wireless card machines, which can also be unreliable.\n\nUsers create a Pix identity number, or \u201ckey\u201d, linked to their mobile number, email address or tax code, through which they are located in the system.\n\nIt is not uncommon to see these Pix keys written on placards begging for donations in the sprawling metropolis of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s financial capital, since homelessness began to rise after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe payments platform also allows the physical withdrawal of cash from participating commercial establishments or ATMs. An upcoming feature will enable a kind of direct debit for recurring bills and the central bank says that, in future, the tool could enable cross-border payments.\n\nPix has been a boon for digital entrepreneurs, according to Bruno Diniz, co-founder at financial innovation consultancy Spiralem. \u201cIt\u2019s made it easier for many fintechs to flourish,\u201d he says, citing online gambling and cryptocurrency exchanges as examples. \u201cSome have surfed the popularity of Pix and even put it in their name.\u201d\n\nIn a country where violent crime and scams are rife, it has also been seized on by organised gangs. This was highlighted by a spate of kidnappings in which victims were forced to transfer significant sums of money to perpetrators using Pix.\n\nIn response, the central bank imposed a transfer limit of R$1,000 in the evenings \u2014 which can be manually altered with a delay \u2014 and many banks have implemented their own safety measures. Duarte says the BCB is dedicating resources to tackling fraudulent accounts and improving security.\n\nHowever, despite the rapid adoption of Pix, it still only represented 12 per cent of the value of non-cash money transfers last year.\n\nOther forms of payments including debit and credit cards remain popular \u2014 the latter because of the option to pay in instalments. And analysts note that traditional bank transfers still dominate overall volumes and are often preferred by companies for larger sums.\n\nOverall, then, Pix\u2019s impact on established lenders has not been as detrimental as some had expected. Moody\u2019s initially estimated it would dent bank fee incomes by 8 per cent, but senior analyst Lisboa says this did not come to pass. \u201cAs Pix gains more traction, the banks are creating services around it that will continue to compensate for the loss of these fees they had on transfers,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s more positive than negative for traditional banks.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e1c7b0e7-4c17-40c4-8e03-16c698674efa"}}, {"id": "0b1a2ace-0592-4e3b-8b8b-f8623eb1cc3f", "event_name": "Marcelo Claure\u2019s Latin America fund makes first investment ", "blurb": "Former SoftBank executive\u2019s Bicycle Capital places $25mn bet on Brazilian motorbike rental start-up ", "date": "2023-09-1500:00:00.0", "body": "A fund established by former SoftBank executive Marcelo Claure and focused on Latin America has made its first investment with a $25mn bet on a Brazilian motorcycle rental start-up.\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo-based Mottu announced on Friday a $50mn Series C funding round jointly led by Claure\u2019s Bicycle Capital and venture capital group QED Investors.\n\nClaure said now was the ideal moment for investing in the region\u2019s tech sector, following a slump in VC funding amid a global downturn.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the best funds that have generated high returns and the best companies, they usually start in a downcycle like this one, where there\u2019s higher need for capital and fewer capital providers,\u201d he told the Financial Times. \u201cA lot of geopolitical issues have emerged that position LatAm in our opinion as a great place to invest and deploy capital.\u201d\n\nMottu offers a low-cost hire service for delivery drivers from disadvantaged communities.\n\n\u201cWe were born in a garage and provide a tool for people to be able to work as couriers,\u201d said Rubens Zanelotto, its chief executive and founder. \u201cWe are heading to double our rental business next year\u201d.\n\nThe company said the fundraising was at a premium to its previous valuation but declined to disclose the figure, citing potential security risks because of where it operates.\n\nBicycle is contributing $20mn towards the primary proceeds, in addition to a purchase of equity from selling shareholders, according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal.\n\nIts debut investment marks a milestone in the comeback of Claure.

The musician and rapper plays the instrument, a metre-long length of iron with regular notches hacked into it, with a knife, just as his parents and grandparents did in Cape Verde. The crowd, crammed into Casa de Francisco, an art-nouveau townhouse turned concert venue in downtown S\u00e3o Paulo, starts bouncing to the fast metallic rhythm.\n\nD\u2019Santiago is in Brazil for the first night of the Kizomba Design Museum, a three-day festival coinciding with the Bienal de S\u00e3o Paulo, which celebrates the interlaced culture of Portugal\u2019s former colonies and their diaspora, from food and music to the slow, sexy, Angolan dance which gives the event its name. It is the initiative of two Angolan creatives: Kalaf Epalanga, who became famous in his band Buraka Som Sistema and has since become a celebrated writer, and N\u00e1stio Mosquito, an artist who has shown at art galleries and biennials internationally. In\u00a0Kimbundu, the Bantu language spoken in northern Angola, kizomba translates as \u201cparty\u201d but Epalanga explains, \u201cWhen we use the word kizomba, we don\u2019t mean one thing, but the whole culture of the diaspora.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were certain jobs that the African communities abroad could do,\u201d Epalanga says of their reasons for calling this venture a \u201cdesign museum\u201d. \u201cYou had music, you had sports, and then you had aesthetics \u2014 design. Kizomba was the driving force of those places: hairdressers, beauty salons, fashion places, that\u2019s where the music was also playing.\u201d\n\nThe next day I attend a dance workshop held on a plaza busy with drinkers marking Brazil\u2019s independence day. The original kizomba music, on which the likes of D\u2019Santiago base their pop and rap, is slower, with lyrics of love and loss. It is danced with a partner, the couples\u2019 bodies as tight as can be, in a smooth continuous flow. The feet of the most skilful kizomba dancers here barely seem to lift from the floor and all the movement happens in the hips and knees as they twirl across the pavement. Don\u2019t ask an Angolan person how they got into kizomba; Mosquito laughs when I do. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much getting into the music. I came out of the music. It\u2019s what my parents, my uncles, my peers and my friends were listening to.\u201d\n\nEpalanga agrees that an interest in kizomba was non-negotiable as a teenager. \u201cEven if you weren\u2019t really a good dancer you had to dance to meet girls, and you had to dance together because there\u2019s no other way to dance. Dancing by yourself: that\u2019s something that I learned in Europe.\u201d\n\nFrom 1975 onwards, as their country\u2019s bitter civil war dragged on, Epalanga\u2019s parents continued to organise parties at their home in Luanda, which would last through to the next morning to beat the military curfew in place. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any clubs, but we\u2019d stay up dancing. So that was me growing up \u2014 in a war but the music kept playing,\u201d Epalanga says.\n\nIt is a fool\u2019s game to attempt to identify with any certainty the origin of the genre. Ask the enthusiasts dancing cheek-to-check in the street and you\u2019ll be hailed with a bewildering range of music terms and history. While all agree there are godfather figures such as Angolan singers Eduardo Paim and Paulo Flores, who closes the festival, there are some that will tell you that kizomba originally sprang from Angola\u2019s semba music and the romantic songs of Ruy Mingas, Artur Nunes and David Z\u00e9. Others will shake their heads and argue that it emerged more from the zouk music of the French Antilles or the joyful celebration of Cape Verde\u2019s coladeira music. In truth it\u2019s a product of all of these, blended in the immigrant bairros of Lisbon and exported back to Africa and beyond.\n\nMore than 400,000 people left Angola to escape the 30-year conflict, and many went to Lisbon to look for work, joining an already established Cape Verdean community. At night they went to the kizomba nightclubs. Although the atmosphere was celebratory, the clubs were also a refuge for the homesick, says Epalanga, who was among their number, then working as a waiter. \u201cWar is such a weird animal, it makes us do things we never thought we could do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then comes a song, then comes a dance, a plate of food from home, someone\u2019s favourite drink, you will see grown men cry like babies.\u201d Mosquito agrees: \u201cFor everybody in those clubs, it was not their first choice to be there, to be in that country working in construction, cleaning houses, washing dishes.\u201d\n\nThe original kizomba clubs of 1990s Lisbon used to close relatively early, many of the patrons working seven days a week to make ends meet. A hardy few, however, who were happy to carry on into the night, moved on to the city\u2019s more mainstream discos where they were exposed to European pop and electronic dance music. Influenced by this, new sub-genres appeared including kuduro, with the rhythm of disco and EDM. In Portugal, the African musicians had access to the latest equipment too, such as synthesisers and mixing desks, that created yet more possibilities.\n\nThough they recall those days wistfully, the idea of the Kizomba Design Museum is not an exercise in nostalgia, the organisers say, pointing out that fans of the music do not prize purity but embrace it for its constant evolution. Instead the festival had a political impetus. The pair say that black immigrant culture is often sidelined or not taken seriously as an economic force. \u201cIf you look at the Portuguese charts, it\u2019s all rappers, and they\u2019re all using kizomba beats. They don\u2019t call it that, but it\u2019s kizomba. The economy of kizomba is big, people are putting their kids through universities off the back of this, people are buying their houses,\u201d says Mosquito.\n\nThey point out too that there is no way of knowing the spending power of the African diaspora in Portugal as the collection of data on race is illegal. \u201cWe are just trying to contextualise that and give it a cultural shape, to give us some power when it comes to negotiating with the government, with the economy,\u201d says Mosquito.\n\nThey have plans to tour the event before one day establishing a permanent home. \u201cWe visit European museums and it\u2019s full of our stolen shit,\u201d Epalanga says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about asking for that stuff to be returned, but it\u2019s trying to rewrite the story of what a museum can be, what gets celebrated.\u201d\n\nkizombadesignmuseum.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow @ftweekend", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4e818eab-ad81-490a-80f8-3c3dfac30638"}}, {"id": "b520cd01-fe4c-46bb-9b72-5c630db99153", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s Lula seals pact with opposition parties in hopes of political boost", "blurb": "President exchanges two cabinet posts for support from rightwing parties", "date": "2023-09-0600:00:00.0", "body": "Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Wednesday sealed a much-anticipated pact with two main opposition parties, in a development set to reshape the country\u2019s political arena and strengthen the government\u2019s hand in passing legislation.\n\nThe deal, which comes after months of wrangling and backroom negotiations, exchanges two cabinet posts in the leftwing leader\u2019s government for political support in Congress from the rightwing Progressistas (Progressives) and Republicanos (Republicans).\n\nBoth parties were important allies of far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, who left office in January.\n\nFor Lula, the pact should help in getting government legislation through a broadly conservative Congress, which has until now acted as a buffer against the president\u2019s more progressive proposals.\n\nAnalysts expect the alliance will expand Lula\u2019s support base in the lower house \u2014 the 513-member Chamber of Deputies \u2014 from about 250 lawmakers to about 320.

Congress will also have a say on the government\u2019s recently announced budget for next year as well as a proposal by finance minister Fernando Haddad to tax offshore entities and online sports gambling.\n\nThe pact underscores the malleability of the political landscape in Bras\u00edlia. Both the Progressives and Republicans are members of the so-called Centr\u00e3o, or Big Centre, an amorphous bloc that trades support for plum appointments and resources for its electoral machines.\n\nThe support of the Centr\u00e3o can often make or break a government. Bolsonaro had allied himself with the bloc, despite once being a vocal opponent of its transactional style of politics.\n\nAs part of their deal, Lula handed over the ministry of sport to Andr\u00e9 Fufuca, a Progressives lawmaker and close ally of house speaker Arthur Lira.

When we are visiting Paris, I think it must feel strange for him to put shoes on to leave our apartment.\n\nThe food in Rio is quite homey \u2013 simple dishes with incredible produce \u2013 and the locals are very generous in how they cook. Brazil has such fertile land that everything grows really fast, and there\u2019s amazing variety \u2013 I feel like I\u00a0eat a new type of fruit on a daily basis.\n\nOne restaurant that is very special to me is Sud, O P\u00e1ssaro Verde, which means \u201cthe green bird\u201d, run by a chef called Roberta Sudbrack, who used to work for a former president of Brazil. Another of my favourites is a place called Tacac\u00e1 do Norte, which isn\u2019t fancy \u2013 you can eat there after a day at the beach \u2013 but it has specialities from northern Brazil. I eat the pastel de caranguejo, which is like fried bread with crab inside that you dip into spicy oil. Otherwise, Brazil is very well known for its meat, and although I don\u2019t eat much of it, there is a great restaurant called Malta Beef Club, which is the best of its kind.\n\nOne of my favourite things to eat is a\u00e7a\u00ed, a speciality made from a berry grown in the north of Brazil, which in Rio they squish and mix with sugar, banana and lots of different things; it has a kind of sorbet texture. It\u2019s really good for you, full of antioxidants, and usually eaten in the\u00a0morning with granola. I go to a place called Asa A\u00e7a\u00ed,\u00a0which takes its name from the Botanical Gardens and does the best bowls in Rio.\n\nAlthough the city doesn\u2019t have the same economic power now as it did when it was the capital, and people generally set up businesses in S\u00e3o Paulo, it\u2019s still very rich in culture \u2013 a lot of artists live here, I think because there\u2019s a slower pace to life. Santa Teresa is a neighbourhood where lots of creatives live; there is one well-known guy, Get\u00falio Damado, who has been there for nearly 50 years. He has a mini truck that he uses to collect rubbish from the neighbourhood, which he then turns into art. Many years ago I saw his work exhibited in a gallery in London, and it was going for a lot of money.\n\nAround the city, there are also mosaics and gardens by the landscape architect Burle Marx, who had a big impact on Rio, turning its pavements into works of art. I love to visit his house, which took 40 years to develop and is now a Unesco heritage site, as well as the Museum of Modern Art, which he contributed to. I also enjoy the new Museu do Amanh\u00e3, built by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, and I always like to visit the Instituto Moreira Salles, which has a great photography collection.\n\nRio is still the capital for Carnival, which shuts down the whole city just before Lent every year \u2013 even the banks close. A lot of work goes into the parades\u00a0that take over the streets, which\u00a0are essentially a competition between different schools, all trying to\u00a0outdo each other with costumes and performances. And then there are the block parties in the different neighbourhoods, with music ranging from traditional Carnival style to modern electronic music. It\u2019s so much fun, and really quite crazy to experience, coming from a city like Paris.\n\nIn Brazil, the culture is strong on so\u00a0many levels \u2013 the film and music industries, the food, nature. It\u2019s like deep-diving into a completely different ecosystem, maybe because it\u2019s quite isolated from the rest\u00a0of the world, and it has a big population, but the local\u00a0specialities and attributes are unique. I feel like I still\u00a0have so much to experience in Brazil, and I\u2019ve been\u00a0coming here all my life.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/acf3d24b-71ac-40d3-ac35-d523367fdc48"}}, {"id": "54de292b-102a-4794-8d62-033944f88acd", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s second-quarter growth beats estimates in boost for Lula", "blurb": "Higher output welcomed by leftwing leader, who criticises high interest rates as a drag on economy ", "date": "2023-09-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s economy grew more than expected in the second quarter on the back of increased activity in industry and services, in a boost for president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s pledge to lift living standards in Latin America\u2019s largest economy.\n\nGross domestic product expanded 0.9 per cent in the three months to the end of June \u2014 a deceleration from the preceding period \u2014 but beating a 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter rise predicted in a Reuters poll of analysts.\n\nWhile output fell in the South American nation\u2019s crucial agricultural sector following a strong harvest in the previous quarter, domestic demand accelerated on the back of higher household and government consumption.\n\nCompared with the same quarter in 2022, GDP increased 3.4 per cent, according to official data from the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics.\n\nThe robust figures were welcomed by the administration of leftwing leader Lula, who has promised to increase public spending and the minimum wage.\n\nThe three-time president has railed against the central bank\u2019s double-digit interest rates as a drag on growth and following Friday\u2019s GDP release he again took aim at its governor, Roberto Campos Neto. Lula said \u201che needs to lower rates\u201d from their double-digit levels to encourage economic activity.\n\nThe institution kicked off monetary easing with a half-point cut last month that took its lending benchmark to 13.25 per cent, but Lula wants it to speed up the cycle.\n\n\u201cHow is a businessperson going to invest? How will they build a factory?\u201d the 77-year-old Lula said at an event. \u201cHow will a businessperson make any investment if he gets very high interest rates?\u201d\n\nForecasts for Brazil\u2019s growth in 2023 have been consistently revised upwards since the start of the year, when Lula assumed office after a narrow election win over hard-right populist Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nEven so, some analysts are predicting a slowdown following a solid first half of the year, which included a 1.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter jump in GDP in the first three months.\n\nWilliam Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said the second-quarter numbers suggested the Brazilian economy was in stronger health than many had thought.\n\n\u201cWe think growth will weaken over the second half of the year as Brazil\u2019s terms of trade worsen, the boost from this year\u2019s harvest unwinds, and fiscal support eases. But it now looks like the economy will easily expand by over 3 per cent in 2023.\u201d\n\nIndependent economists last week predicted on average an expansion of 2.3 per cent in 2023, according to a survey by the central bank, up from a forecast of 0.8 per cent at the start of the year.\n\nThe new outlook is likely to weigh on how monetary policymakers approach future rates decisions, Jackson added.\n\n\u201cThe current strength of the economy probably rules out the central bank stepping up the pace of its easing cycle from 50 basis point moves.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/33683f73-4a23-4ce3-8edb-f2a1ec1639d6"}}, {"id": "3e811319-0220-44fe-9fdc-4acc71b74cc2", "event_name": "Brazil\u2019s jewellery scandal adds to Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s legal woes", "blurb": "Probe over expensive foreign gifts damages hard-right former president\u2019s ability to build a political legacy", "date": "2023-08-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Jewels of Arabia has the ring of a primetime telenovela beloved by Brazilian TV audiences, with a tangled plot of power, palace intrigue and unapologetic bling.\n\nBut in Latin American\u2019s largest democracy the title relates to the real-life drama enveloping former president Jair Bolsonaro and members of his inner circle, who are accused of conspiring to sell expensive gifts from overseas dignitaries, including a diamond-encrusted watch and a gold-plated miniature palm tree.\n\nThe scandal has deepened the legal troubles facing the far-right populist since he left office at the end of last year, after losing to the leftwinger Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. At stake is not just Bolsonaro\u2019s freedom \u2014 the alleged crimes can be punished with jail time \u2014 but also his ability to forge a lasting family franchise.\n\nThe probe steps up a gear on Thursday, when the rightwing firebrand and several others implicated will be questioned by police.\n\nMarina Pontes at political consultancy Prospectiva said the affair was \u201ca significant blow for a figure who was elected, governed and built his political capital on a strong moralist discourse that had anti-corruption at its core\u201d.\n\nThe items at issue were received on official trips during the Bolsonaro administration to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Under Brazilian law, such donations are supposed to enter the public collection.\n\nBut police investigators claim presidential aides illegally diverted the objects and tried to sell them in the US, generating tens of thousands of dollars in cash proceeds they suspect were intended for Bolsonaro.\n\nThe 68-year-old politician has denied wrongdoing, insisting he received no money and saying he wants to \u201cclear it up as soon as possible\u201d. He argues an exemption permits gifts of a \u201cvery personal\u201d nature, such as caps, ties or slippers, to be retained \u2014 even though the federal accounts watchdog has said this only applies to objects of \u201clow monetary value\u201d.\n\nThe jewels controversy also threatens Bolsonaro\u2019s hopes of extending a political dynasty beyond his three politician sons as the allegations reach his wife, Michelle. An Evangelical Christian popular with conservative women, allies praise the 41-year-old as an electoral asset and tout her as a possible candidate for the senate or even vice-presidential ticket in 2026.\n\nInvestigators have now been given access to the couple\u2019s bank records at home and abroad by the supreme court.\n\nNo charges have yet been brought, but the suspected offences include embezzlement and money laundering \u2014 both of which can carry custodial sentences.\n\nBolsonaro has already been barred from running for office until 2030 because of campaign violations. He also faces allegations of a plot to bug a supreme court judge and a probe into whether he instigated violence by hardcore supporters who stormed government buildings in January. The former president denies wrongdoing in all the cases.\n\nQuestions over presidential gifts first emerged when local paper Estado de S. Paulo reported earlier this year that airport customs officers had seized undeclared diamond jewellery worth an estimated R$16mn ($3.3mn) from an adviser to a minister returning from an official visit to Saudi Arabia in 2021.\n\nFor investigators, much of the case appears to hinge on Bolsonaro\u2019s former aide-de-camp, army Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid, who police place at the centre of the alleged scheme. Invariably dressed in uniform and decorations parading a two-decade military career, the 44-year-old was considered the former president\u2019s right-hand man.\n\nCid is in custody over a separate investigation into whether Covid-19 vaccine certificates were falsified so the ex-president could enter the US. Cid\u2019s father, a reserve army general who trained alongside former captain Bolsonaro, has also been implicated.\n\nPolice say data retrieved through Cid\u2019s mobile phone shows that after accompanying the then-president on a diplomatic trip to the US in June 2022, he sold two watches to a store in a Pennsylvania shopping mall. The Rolex and Patek Philippe together fetched $68,000.\n\nIn another instance, a gift set by the luxury brand Chopard containing a pen, cufflinks and Arab rosary among other articles was taken to a New York auction house but did not sell, according to a court document.\n\nElements of the story painted by police are more farce than melodrama. Sculptures of a boat and palm tree were spirited away on the presidential plane at the end of 2022 when Bolsonaro travelled to Florida to avoid Lula\u2019s inauguration. However, they failed to sell as it turned out the pieces were not solid gold.\n\nCid\u2019s lawyer told Brazilian media his client would confess he acted on orders and that the money belonged to Bolsonaro, though it is now unclear after the attorney later gave differing versions of the story.\n\nAs a drip-feed of revelations grips the South American nation, many Brazilians are now asking the same question: will Bolsonaro be arrested?\n\nGuilherme Boulos, a leftwing lawmaker with the Socialism and Freedom party, said: \u201cHe and everyone else involved in the scheme must be punished so that Brazilians know that a president cannot do whatever he wants without being held accountable for it.\u201d\n\nAccusations from Bolsonaro\u2019s backers that the investigation is politically motivated mirror denunciations once levelled by supporters of Lula, who previously ruled between 2003 and 2010. After leaving office, the leftist was found guilty of corruption and imprisoned. His conviction was since overturned.\n\nRicardo Salles, a lawmaker who was environment minister under Bolsonaro, said he believed the scandal was being pushed by a political establishment intent on keeping his former boss out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was criminal. The maximum you can criticise is selling a gift,\u201d said the conservative politician, who denies separate charges of involvement in illegal timber exports while in office. \u201cHe\u2019s a simple guy. I have never seen him wear a fancy watch, shirt or tie.\u201d\n\nThe political implications are far from straightforward. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will end up in punishment. The jewels are not the same thing as public money,\u201d said Valdemar Costa Neto, head of Bolsonaro\u2019s Liberal party. \u201cBut if he is imprisoned, it will increase our votes and his popularity in the next election.\u201d\n\nIt is too early to write off Bolsonaro\u2019s influence as a result of the affair, analysts said. A recent opinion poll showed the rightwinger\u2019s approval at the same level as on election day last October.\n\nChristopher Garman of political consultancy Eurasia Group said support for Bolsonaro would probably hold up, adding: \u201cHe will continue to be a potential kingmaker in the opposition\u2019s camp.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a43392bb-41e4-435d-a40c-06c0ceec89d9"}}, {"id": "273b9b17-d30b-4a33-96af-03bacdd00561", "event_name": "Latin America\u2019s foreign investment boom defies political turmoil", "blurb": "Redrawing of global supply chain map helps boost the region ", "date": "2023-08-3000:00:00.0", "body": "The year 2022 was a vintage one for political turmoil in Latin America. Colombia elected a leftwing former guerrilla as president, Chile considered (and rejected) a radical new constitution, Peru\u2019s elected president was impeached and imprisoned pending trial after after a failed attempt to seize extraordinary powers and Brazil\u2019s far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro narrowly lost a bid for re-election.\n\nIt was also a record year for foreign direct investment. Investors committed $225bn to Latin America and the Caribbean in 2022, according to ECLAC, the UN\u2019s economic agency for the region. That was 55 per cent more than the previous year and comfortably surpassed the previous peak a decade earlier. Part of the increase was a post-pandemic rebound but the number of future projects announced also rose, though more modestly.\n\nThere were other surprises. Despite alarm in Washington over growing Chinese interest in Latin America, Beijing and Hong Kong accounted for just 3 per cent of the money flowing into the region last year. That was far behind the US\u2019s 38 per cent or the EU\u2019s 29 per cent (though some Chinese investment could have been channelled via third countries).\n\nAlthough Latin America has been much touted as a location for renewable energy investment, more foreign money was spent last year on fossil fuel projects in the region than on solar or wind, the first time this has happened for a decade.\n\nExxon\u2019s drive to step up oil production from Guyana was a key reason. Brazil and Argentina are both boosting oil and gas production too. Most Latin American governments want to make the most of their fossil fuels before they become stranded assets and global oil companies are keen to diversify sources of supply because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nAlejo Czerwonko, chief investment officer for Latin America at UBS Wealth Management, believes the investment boom in the region reflects a rapid redrawing of the global supply chain map. \u201cCountries and companies are promoting resilience, security and safety over price and efficiency for the first time in over 30 years,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is good for Latin America.\u201d\n\nThe nearshoring winds are certainly blowing in Latin America\u2019s direction, thanks to its proximity to the US and privileged trade access enjoyed by Mexico and Central America in particular.\n\nBut the politics have not gone away either. Mexico\u2019s economy accounts for almost a quarter of Latin America and the Caribbean\u2019s combined GDP and should be the prime destination for nearshoring, yet it managed to attract only 17 per cent of the total foreign investment in the region last year.\n\n\u201cWe could have seen better performance [from Mexico] if it wasn\u2019t for some of the micro issues,\u201d says Ben Ramsey, head of emerging markets sovereign strategy at JPMorgan, in an oblique reference to President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies.\n\nThese included abolishing Mexico\u2019s investment promotion agency after taking office in 2018, reasserting state control over the energy industry and picking fights with some foreign companies based in the country. Ramsey believes, however, that Mexico\u2019s numbers will improve as nearshoring gains more traction and investors look to the next election in 2024.\n\nWhile Mexico underperformed, it was the opposite story in Brazil, the region\u2019s biggest economy with just under a third of GDP. The South American giant outperformed the region, securing 41 per cent of all the foreign investment.\n\nBrazil was so popular with investors that it became the world\u2019s number five destination for foreign investment last year, behind the US, China, Hong Kong and Singapore, according to Unctad. Brazil is also the top developing economy for international renewable energy investment, according to Unctad, with $115bn in projects.\n\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs, the head of ECLAC, believes Latin America can compete effectively with Asia for foreign investment, although it needs to work harder.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t really any secrets,\u201d he says. \u201cBeyond the flows to extractive industries\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it\u2019s very clear that the most successful countries in attracting more technologically sophisticated FDI have a combination of conditions including rule of law, good operational and logistical regimes, and above all high quality human resources.\u201d\n\nCan the region\u2019s presidents deliver or will last year\u2019s strong investment numbers prove to be a flash in the pan? \u201cThe opportunity is there but it takes two to tango,\u201d said UBS\u2019s Czerwonko. \u201cQuite frankly, Latin American leaders are not doing a whole lot to get out there and promote their countries as attractive destinations for foreign investment.\u201d\n\nmichael.stott@ft.com\n\n\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6a3f0ce5-9988-417b-af35-3a0766050fe3"}}, {"id": "4d26a78a-dc8d-42d8-a49a-19817bdd2410", "event_name": "Lula nears pact with Brazilian rightwingers to boost passage of agenda", "blurb": "Government in talks on \u2018political front\u2019 with parties once allied to hard-right former president Jair Bolsonaro ", "date": "2023-08-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is close to sealing an unlikely alliance with two rightwing parties formerly allied to his defeated rival Jair Bolsonaro, in a move aimed at strengthening the hand of his leftist administration.\n\nThe deal would cede cabinet posts and potentially other roles in return for support in Congress, where the coalition led by Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party does not command a majority. After drawn-out talks, final negotiations are expected this week following Lula\u2019s return from a trip to Africa that included the Brics summit in Johannesburg.\n\nSince the three-time leader of Latin America\u2019s largest democracy took office again in January, Brazil\u2019s fragmented and right-leaning legislature has pushed back against elements of his programme, which includes higher public spending and tougher protections for the environment, workers and minorities.\n\nIn exchange for leading a ministry each, the Progressive and Republican parties will be expected to furnish votes in the lower chamber for government-sponsored bills. Details are yet to be confirmed and the administration may also offer control of a state-owned bank.\n\nAlexandre Padilha, a minister and Lula\u2019s chief interlocutor with parliament, said a deal would bring on board forces that had already backed some of the government\u2019s proposals.\n\n\u201cWe are strengthening [and] consolidating a political front that can provide even more stability in Congress,\u201d he told the Financial Times.\u00a0\u201cIt carries an important weight [of] parliamentarians and parties who were in the Bolsonaro government and supported him during the election, but have embraced this economic agenda of saving democracy and reducing inequality.\u201d\n\nDespite progress on certain bills \u2014 including the passage of looser limits on public expenditure, and approval in the lower house of long-awaited tax reform \u2014 Lula has suffered a series of parliamentary defeats. Lawmakers thwarted plans to roll back privatisation of the water and sewerage sector, before stripping powers from the environment and newly created indigenous affairs ministries.\n\nBoth parties set to enter the executive are ideologically closer to the ex-president, a hard-right populist narrowly beaten by Lula in last year\u2019s elections. With internal divisions over the alliance, not all their lawmakers are likely to vote in line with the administration.\n\n\u201cI am not interested in government posts and will remain in opposition,\u201d said a member of the Progressives, who asked not to be named.\n\nThe agreement for a cabinet reshuffle is nevertheless considered by analysts as a significant boost to Lula\u2019s ability to govern, nearly eight months into his four-year term.\n\nFernando Sch\u00fcler, a professor at Insper university in S\u00e3o Paulo, estimated the informal pact could give Lula roughly 320 deputies in the lower house, out of a total 513.\n\n\u201cLula wants to create a platform for broad dialogue,\u201d he added. \u201cWith the reshuffle, he will have a good basis for dialogue and a greater stability in relations with Congress.\u201d\n\nSchuler said this should also lessen the president\u2019s dependence on the speaker of the lower house, Arthur Lira of the Progressives, one of the most influential figures in Bras\u00edlia who controls voting schedules and impeachment requests.\n\nLira represents a powerful and amorphous grouping of mostly centre-right lawmakers without a consistent ideology, known as the Centr\u00e3o or \u201cBig Centre\u201d.\n\nThe bloc trades support for plum appointments and resources for its electoral machines.\u00a0Bolsonaro also formed a partnership with the Centr\u00e3o, despite having disavowed its transactional style of politics.\n\nLula said on Tuesday that he planned to create a new ministry for small and medium-sized businesses, potentially accommodating one of the new cabinet entrants.\n\nThe new alliance may concern some investors who have counted on a conservative-dominated Congress acting as a brake on measures perceived as unfriendly to business.\n\nBut the fact many lawmakers do not share Lula\u2019s vision could force the president to avoid more radical proposals, according to analysts.\n\n\u201cThese parties do not commit to unconditional support, and agenda items will continue to be addressed on a case-by-case basis,\u201d said Wagner Parente, chief executive of BMJ Consultoria. \u201cTo secure approval in the [Chamber of Deputies] and Senate, the economic agenda will need to be moderate.\u201d\n\nNor does Lula\u2019s bargain mean he will be able to rely on durable support, analysts said.\u00a0At the start of his mandate, he handed three ministerial roles to the centre-right Uni\u00e3o Brasil, but many of its number have already gone against the administration.\n\n\u201cIt is a model of very transitory loyalty and does not guarantee that the major reforms will be passed,\u201d said Esther Solano, professor of international relations at the Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBrazilian presidents also have at their disposal discretionary budget grants that can be awarded for lawmakers to spend in their constituencies, often used as a means to secure votes in congress.

It is the cornerstone of the leftwing president\u2019s promises of extra money for social welfare and infrastructure in Latin America\u2019s largest economy.\n\nRepresentatives in Bras\u00edlia\u2019s lower house gave final approval on Tuesday despite simmering investor concerns about government profligacy and the potential impact on public borrowing.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage is a milestone for Lula, who previously ruled between 2003 and 2010 and returned to power in January after his election win over Jair Bolsonaro. It paves the way for a major public works programme underpinned by R$370bn ($74bn) of federal funds over four years.\n\n\u201cThe new framework expands the government\u2019s margins for investments and spending. In this sense it is a victory for Lula,\u201d Angelo Coronel, senator from the centrist Social Democratic party, told the Financial Times before the vote.\n\nThe previous spending ceiling, in place from 2017, meant budgets could not rise by more than the rate of inflation. Investors saw it as a tool to stabilise Brazil\u2019s debts.\n\nFor Lula and his leftwing Workers\u2019 party, however, it was an obstacle to improving livelihoods in a nation where about 60mn people live in poverty.\n\nThe new fiscal regime comes as the outlook for the economy brightens. Forecasts for 2023 gross domestic product growth have been revised up to an average 2.3 per cent, from 0.8 per cent at the start of the year, according to a central bank survey of economists, driven in part by booming agribusiness.\n\nAt the same time, Brazil\u2019s central bank has begun monetary easing, cutting the benchmark lending rate by half a percentage point to 13.25 per cent this month.\n\nUnder the new fiscal framework, expenditure will be allowed to rise annually by up to 70 per cent of the preceding year\u2019s increase in government income. Within this, spending must grow annually by a minimum of 0.6 per cent above inflation, up to a maximum of 2.5 per cent.\n\nFinance minister Fernando Haddad has pledged to achieve a balanced budget before debt interest payments by next year, intending to raise revenues with measures such as duties on online gambling and a clampdown on tax evasion.\n\nHowever, there is scepticism in the financial sector that the administration can eliminate the budget deficit without increasing taxes. Many economists believe revenue collection goals are too optimistic and criticise the absence of any meaningful reduction in spending.\n\n\u201cThe new framework is weaker than the spending cap when it comes to its ability to rein in the rise in public debt,\u201d said Marcos Casarin, chief Latin America economist at Oxford Economics.\n\n\u201cBy shifting the focus away from spending and into a primary balance target, the new rule grants the government more leeway to increase spending by allowing authorities to artificially boost the following year\u2019s revenue target. This perverse incentive is what weakens the rule.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Beatriz Langella in S\u00e3o Paulo", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2927921f-92bc-4975-bdbf-afda3f778966"}}, {"id": "30d9aa49-d364-467e-ba56-6b4a9daeace3", "event_name": "China urges Brics to become geopolitical rival to G7", "blurb": "Leaders from bloc of developing economies will gather this week to debate expansion", "date": "2023-08-2000:00:00.0", "body": "China will push the Brics bloc of emerging markets to become a full-scale rival to the G7 this week, as leaders from across the developing world gather to debate the forum\u2019s biggest expansion in more than a decade.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa has invited more than 60 heads of state and government to a summit in Johannesburg from Wednesday when several countries could be invited to join the bloc of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, said several officials familiar with talks.\n\nBut in the run-up to the summit New Delhi has clashed with Beijing over the expansion.

Bolsonaro repeatedly insisted, without proof, that the country\u2019s electronic voting set-up was vulnerable to fraud and manipulation.\n\nA parliamentary inquiry into the so-called anti-democratic acts this week heard a computer programmer who alleged that Bolsonaro backers paid him to try to hack the electoral system, without success.

It is in bankruptcy protection and any deal requires approval from five banks with claims over the shares as a guarantee for debts of about R$15bn ($3bn).\n\nHowever, a complex ownership structure and the Lula government\u2019s hands-on industrial agenda make the negotiations far from straightforward. Talks with another potential buyer, the US-listed chemicals group LyondellBasell, broke down in 2019.\n\nKey to how the situation plays out is Brazilian oil major Petrobras, the other main investor in Braskem with a 36.1 per cent shareholding.\n\nTo fulfil a campaign call by Lula, the state-controlled energy business is looking to diversify beyond its main activity of pumping offshore crude. One target area is petrochemicals, which it exited in the past. If Novonor agrees to sell its Braskem stake, Petrobras has the right of first refusal.\n\nBraskem\u2019s bylaws also stipulate any buyer must\u00a0extend its offer to all shareholders, including Petrobras and smaller minority investors.\n\nSo far, Apollo has teamed up with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, or Adnoc, with an offer pitched at R$47 per share. It consists of R$20 in cash, R$20 in perpetual bonds with 4 per cent interest and R$7 of deferred payments in the form of warrants. Goldman Sachs is advising the consortium.\n\nThe bid implies a R$37.5bn ($7.7bn) valuation for the whole of Braskem \u2014 well above its market capitalisation of R$18.6bn. According to estimates by BTG Pactual analysts, however, it equates to less than R$30 a share on a net present value basis.\n\nFor state-owned Adnoc, the attraction is an entry into the Americas as it embarks on an international push into chemicals, according to a person familiar with the bid.\n\nA bid for R$36.50 a share in cash has been tabled by Unipar, a smaller industry peer of Braskem. It intends to acquire 34.4 per cent for R$10bn and leave Novonor with a 4 per cent slice. Unipar is being advised by local investment bank BR Partners.\n\nAnother cash offer for the entire stake worth R$10bn came from J&F Investimentos. It is the holding entity of the billionaire Batista brothers of Brazil, whose family founded JBS, the world\u2019s largest meatpacker.\n\nWhile the size of the Adnoc/Apollo offer envisages making good the creditor banks in full according to people aware of the details, albeit only partially in cash, under the other two bids a chunk of the R$15bn owed would remain outstanding.\n\nWith Braskem\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo-quoted shares trading at about R$23, the stock market appears sceptical at the chances of a takeover happening.\n\nPetrobras said it was conducting due diligence on Braskem but was yet to make a decision. Its chief executive Jean Paul Prates, a former senator appointed by Lula after he assumed office in January, recently told the Financial Times that Braskem should remain \u201cunder Brazilian control\u201d.\n\nPeople involved in or close to the sale process say this could be achieved through Petrobras maintaining its interest alongside either a domestic or foreign co-investor.\n\nAnother state actor involved is the national development bank, BNDES, which is one of the lenders that must agree to any proposal. Its head, also a close Lula ally, has suggested the president himself will have the final say.\n\nSeparately, a senior government official who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the case was being carefully considered. \u201cIt\u2019s under analysis with a view to strengthening the petrochemicals industry in Brazil,\u201d the person said.\n\nNovonor\u2019s disposal has its roots in a sprawling corruption scandal that unfolded the last time Lula\u2019s party was in power. Then known as Odebrecht, it led a cartel of contractors that overbilled Petrobras, with bribes paid to executives and public officials.\n\nDozens of businessmen and politicians were jailed, including Lula \u2014 although his conviction was later overturned. Odebrecht was brought to its knees financially and pledged its Braskem shares as collateral for loans.\n\nCentral figures at both Brazilian bidders for the stake were also reprimanded. Brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista signed leniency deals with prosecutors and spent time incarcerated.\n\nThe controlling shareholder of Unipar and its former chief executive, Frank Geyer Abubakir, received a fine for irregularities he says were related to the creation of a business later sold to Braskem.\n\n\u201cI made a mistake in a very difficult situation, almost 15 years ago. I have admitted, paid and learnt from it,\u201d he told the FT.\n\nGeyer argued Unipar\u2019s offer represented \u201cthe best price\u201d and said it had R$10bn of bank financing commitments. Established by his family more than half a century ago, he said the company\u2019s industry experience would make it a good long-term partner.\n\n\u201cUnipar has the culture and the knowhow of the sector,\u201d he added. \u201cWe managed petrochemical plants and also constructed factories that today are part of Braskem.\u201d\n\nBraskem, Novonor, J&F, Apollo and Adnoc declined to comment.\n\nAny new owner will confront a weak global petrochemicals market. Braskem reported a second-quarter net loss of R$771mn on revenues down 30 per cent.\n\nA possible complicating factor is the fallout from an environmental disaster in the city of Macei\u00f3, where Braskem operated a rock salt mine. Due to geological disturbances, some 60,000 residents have been permanently evacuated.\n\nDespite already making payouts, the company is facing further compensation claims and the state governor has requested the divestment process be suspended.\n\nGiven the political dimension and the consensus required from various stakeholders, people involved say Braskem\u2019s ownership is unlikely to be resolved in a hurry.\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/bbdfa92a-8c62-48b5-922d-3d77bb1ff51b"}}, {"id": "f8d29835-0d93-44f5-a5f9-5a56d26a5186", "event_name": "Community sits at the heart of city cycling initiative in Brazil\u2019s Fortaleza", "blurb": "Direct action from residents in the coastal city helped spur rethink on urban mobility ", "date": "2023-08-1600:00:00.0", "body": "As a young woman, Yvanna Peixoto and her fellow residents spent their free time painting white lines with a makeshift marker along the streets of Fortaleza in north-eastern Brazil to create informal cycle lanes.\n\nMore than a decade later, Peixoto, 34, and now a teacher, reflects on how community action helped spur the city\u2019s authorities to repurpose public spaces for people rather than cars.\n\n\u201cIt was a public intervention,\u201d says Peixoto. Every Friday, grassroots group Massa Cr\u00edtica led \u201cBicicletada\u201d, a community ride to encourage cycling and lobby for safer roads for cyclists. People were reluctant to cycle because roads were dangerous and drivers aggressive, she says, \u201cso we\u2019d cycle very slowly and hand out pamphlets to drivers to make them aware\u201d.\n\nCommunity action such as Massa Cr\u00edtica helped sway policy in the coastal city, home to 2.4mn people. Between 2014 and 2022, Fortaleza expanded its cycle network from 68km to 400km. In 2014, a ride sharing scheme was launched with bikes for both children and adults, while cycle racks were installed at travel hubs to create an integrated transport system. Shared bikes are free with the city\u2019s public transport card, while fines for traffic violations are used to fund improvements to the cycle network.\n\nIt\u2019s a long way from the state motto coined in the 1920s by president Washington Lu\u00eds: \u201cTo govern is to build roads.\u201d\n\nInformal community planning in Latin America dates back to the Spanish and Portuguese colonial era, says Jos\u00e9 Chong of the UN-Habitat\u2019s Global Public Space Programme, which promotes inclusive spaces. \u201cThere will always be a smaller version of a soccer field. A place next to a church or pocket park becomes somewhere to eat. If a government doesn\u2019t provide the facilities, people will do it themselves.\u201d\n\nOfficial government support for change in Fortaleza came in 2014 when city mayor Roberto Cl\u00e1udio pushed for expansion of cycle lanes as part of efforts to reduce traffic and pollution and increase mobility. Jos\u00e9 Sarto continues his predecessor\u2019s commitment with an emphasis on young people. \u201cYoung people make up about 33 per cent of our population\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. so we regularly held listening meetings and went into schools\u201d as part of policy consultations, he says.\n\nBy 2024, Fortaleza aims to have 600km of protected bike lanes and 100 safe intersections for cyclists, supported by the Bloomberg Initiative for Cycling Infrastructure, a Bloomberg Philanthropies project. Through BICI, 10 cities will receive technical assistance from the Global Designing Cities Initiative and funding. Fortaleza will test innovative materials for lane separation, such as continuous tree pits which increase space for tree roots, soil and hydration, while also providing shade for cyclists.\n\n\u201cThe social dimension of sustainability has to be the main objective of public policy,\u201d says Isabela Castro, Fortaleza\u2019s urban mobility co-ordinator.\n\nAs well as wanting safer roads for cyclists, Fortaleza\u2019s residents lobbied for cycling lanes to increase connections from the city outskirts to the centre.\n\nGovernment incentives for carmakers and a road-building boom in the 1950s divided the cycle-riding poor from the car-driving wealthy. The inequalities are still visible across Latin American cities today. Peripheral areas, which are mostly low-income neighbourhoods, tend to have narrower streets, making it harder to limit space for cars, says Castro.\n\n\u201cWe are not a poor city, but we are a city with a lot of inequalities,\u201d says Luiz Saboia, Fortaleza\u2019s innovation technical lead. \u201cWhen we started the bike share system, we relied on private companies who didn\u2019t want to go to the outskirts \u2014 they wanted to go to the rich part of the city.\u201d\n\nConnections between municipal and federal roads are under federal jurisdiction, adding complications, says Saboia. Though mayor Sarto emphasises: \u201cWe can make agreements to get [federal] permission to make these cycle paths\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we have a good relationship.\u201d\n\nBut support for cycling still benefits livelihoods, Saboia says, citing informal waste collectors known as catadores. In Fortaleza, where most of them live on the city peripheries, their income jumped 40 per cent when they used electric tricycles provided by the city instead of their traditional carro\u00e7as, or carts, as they were able to collect more recyclables which they sell. Many also reported an increased sense of dignity, he says.\n\nFortaleza takes inspiration from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, where citizen-led car-free Sundays, Ciclov\u00eda, started in 1974 to promote cycling. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand Bogot\u00e1\u2019s culture without Ciclov\u00eda,\u201d says Giovanni Zayas of GDCI. \u201cLatin America is writing its own story by reclaiming public space.\u201d More than 60 per cent of Latin American cities have dedicated departments for bike projects and 80 per cent have some form of cycling policy. Even smaller cities, such as Rosario and C\u00f3rdoba in Argentina, have about 100km of cycle lanes.\n\nIn Fortaleza, the number of fatal road accidents has fallen from 377 in 2014 to 157 in 2022. This has been vital in making cyclists feel safer and cycling a more attractive transport option.\n\nAs policy and infrastructure changes encourage cycling across Latin America, the social status of bikes is also changing. But residents remain central to developing the new culture.\n\n\u201cI cycle everywhere,\u201d says Peixoto. \u201cI even go to the bar and cycle back with friends.\u201d This includes Aleksandra, also 34, who agrees: \u201cI feel safe coming back from late-night parties on bike paths.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/868fc635-c83a-4e97-a5bf-dfeec5e8815c"}}, {"id": "97fd6ec0-4a32-4f04-8df3-490077e9bf86", "event_name": "Brics creator slams \u2018ridiculous\u2019 idea for common currency", "blurb": "Jim O'Neill questions emerging nations bloc\u2019s achievements as it considers expansion", "date": "2023-08-1500:00:00.0", "body": "The former Goldman Sachs economist who coined the Brics acronym has dismissed as \u201cridiculous\u201d the notion that the group of emerging nations might develop its own currency, as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa prepare to discuss whether to expand the bloc.\n\nAhead of the group\u2019s 15th summit next week, Lord Jim O\u2019Neill told the Financial Times that the Brics had \u201cnever achieved anything since they first started meeting\u201d, eight years after he created the phrase in a 2001 research note he wrote as the bank\u2019s chief economist.\n\nBrics nations such as Russia and China have called for the bloc to challenge the US dollar\u2019s status as the world\u2019s reserve currency, but South Africa, which is hosting this year\u2019s summit, has said a Brics currency is not on the agenda for the gathering in Johannesburg.\n\nO\u2019Neill said creating a common currency for the five strongly diverging economies would be unfeasible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d he said in response to calls for a \u201ctrading currency\u201d from Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and other politicians from the bloc. \u201cThey\u2019re going to create a Brics central bank? How would you do that? It\u2019s embarrassing almost.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill coined the Brics acronym in a Goldman paper in order to highlight the economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China and the need for global economic and political governance to be reshaped to include them. The countries themselves embraced the term and began holding summits in 2009.\n\nWith dozens of countries formally or informally expressing interest in joining the bloc, according to a South African diplomat, the summit could be its biggest leap forward in membership since South Africa joined in 2010. But criteria for admission have not been decided, and the issue of expansion has emerged as another faultline among the quintet.\n\nThe FT reported earlier this year that Saudi Arabia was in talks to join the New Development Bank, the lender set up by the Brics members in 2014 as an alternative to the World Bank, and subsequently joined by Egypt, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cQuite what they attempt to achieve beyond powerful symbolism, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, who is now a senior adviser at UK think-tank Chatham House.\n\nHe said the dollar\u2019s dominance over the global financial system was not beneficial for emerging countries. \u201cThe dollar\u2019s role is not ideal for the way the world has evolved.

National anthem blaring, the supporters of defeated far-right president Jair Bolsonaro extended their right arms, palms flat, in salute.\n\n\u201cThe whole world saw that it was a Nazi gesture. It\u2019s a gesture that you never do, you can\u2019t do,\u201d said Capra.\n\nThe incident in S\u00e3o Miguel do Oeste was among several that reignited fears about the growth of far-right extremism in Brazil, particularly in the country\u2019s south. Historically home to German and Italian immigrants, southern states such as Paran\u00e1 and Santa Catarina, where S\u00e3o Miguel is located, have long been conservative strongholds. They remain a bastion of political support for Bolsonaro, the populist former army captain.\n\nCapra\u2019s alarm over the salute was echoed by the ambassadors of Germany and Israel and the Brazilian Holocaust Museum. Yet the council ousted her after an investigation declared the gesture was \u201cculturally common in the region\u201d, where it is used in religious oaths and graduations.\n\nIn recent months, southern Brazil has been the focus of numerous police investigations into neo-Nazi cells. More than a dozen raids were carried out in one week in July alone, with police seizing \u201cvast [amounts of] Nazi and extremist material\u201d, plus four firearms and dozens of knives and other weapons, including two maces. Thirteen of the 15 search warrant locations were in southern states, while the other two were in S\u00e3o Paulo state.\n\nThe raids resulted from another probe last year into the \u201cmanufacture of a firearm, using a 3D printer, by a neo-Nazi cell in Santa Catarina\u201d, local police said. That group practised \u201ccult rituals to Hitlerist doctrine and called themselves \u2018the new SS of Santa Catarina\u2019\u201d, the police added.\n\nIn amateur footage, two members of the group stand between a burning torch and a Nazi flag. \u201cOne people, one Reich, one Fuhrer,\u201d a man says in German as he discharges a pistol in the air.\n\nIn the first six months of this year, there were more than 20 police investigations into neo-Nazi groups in Brazil, up from nine in the whole of last year and just one in 2018, according to police data reported by Reuters.\n\nPolice figures also showed a 380 per cent surge in the number of \u201cantidemocratic acts\u201d, jumping from 68 in the whole of last year to 326 in just the first two months of this year. The bulk of these cases \u2014 which include attempts to impede elections or incite violence against the state \u2014 were in the south, notably Santa Catarina.\n\n\u201cFrom 2018-19 onwards we have seen the rapid growth of these neo-Nazi groups,\u201d said Leonel Radde, a former police officer who is now a state lawmaker for Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\u2019s southernmost state.\n\n\u201cThe far right is advancing everywhere \u2014 not just here in Brazil \u2014 so this empowers these groups, they start to feel free,\u201d he said. Uncontrolled online chat communities had also boosted the groups, he said.\n\nA Brazilian arrested last year for the attempted assassination of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Argentina\u2019s vice-president, was tattooed with a Nazi symbol.\n\nRadde said the country\u2019s south had \u201cthe largest Nazi party outside of Germany in the prewar period\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is a culture of separatism, of considering the south more advanced \u2014 a region that supports the rest of Brazil, which is nonsense of course. There is this idea that it is a white region of Italian-German immigration and not so much influenced by black Brazilians,\u201d he added.\n\nPomerode, a tidy town of bilingual signposts and timber-framed houses in the hills of Santa Catarina, is one of Brazil\u2019s oldest German settlements and is named after Pomerania. More than 80 per cent of the municipality voted for Bolsonaro in last October\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cIf you go to the countryside, you\u2019ll see that there are still a lot of Germans, the colonisers, speaking in German. If they see that you\u2019re Brazilian, a common person, they\u2019ll hardly talk to you,\u201d said Izilda Alves, a resident.\n\nBut she added that while the region was conservative and traditional, like many people in Pomerode she believed the reports of extremism in the south were exaggerated.\n\n\u201cThis extremism story was created by people who want to benefit from it,\u201d said Cristina da Silva, another Pomerode resident, who believes the leftwing administration of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is using claims of neo-Nazism to persecute political opponents.\n\nBoth women echoed fringe talking points that claim \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that Bolsonaro only lost last year\u2019s election because of fraud in Brazil\u2019s electronic voting machines.\n\nIn nearby Blumenau, Fl\u00e1vio Linhares runs the Conservative Movement for Santa Catarina, which he said seeks to raise awareness of conservative beliefs and the values of \u201cGreek philosophy, Roman law and the family\u201d.\n\nCitizens in the region abhorred extremism, he said, and claims of Nazism were exaggerations driven by the \u201cnotorious prejudice\u201d of the media.\n\n\u201cI see a certain type of xenophobia against people from the south,\u201d he said, referencing the example of the raised-arm salute, which he noted was often used in official ceremonies. \u201cWe can\u2019t say hello on the street without it being considered a Nazi salute.\u201d\n\nLinhares added that conservatives were often excluded from public life, even though rightwing parties dominate the federal Congress and Bolsonaro won almost 70 per cent of the vote in Santa Catarina last year.\n\nHowever, Jo\u00e3o Klug, professor of history at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, said justifying the salute as \u201csomething \u2018common in the region\u2019 does not hold water\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhere did they learn to sing the national anthem with their hands outstretched? And why at this critical moment did these people [in S\u00e3o Miguel do Oeste] see fit to express their patriotism in this way? It is ridiculous to say the least.\u201d\n\nKlug said the neo-Nazi movement was boosted by the presidency of Bolsonaro, a nationalist who employed derogatory language towards minorities. The former president officially stated that Nazism should be repudiated, but his broader sympathy towards far-right groups was taken as tacit encouragement.\n\nBolsonaro was banned from political office for eight years in June after the country\u2019s electoral court ruled he had abused his presidential powers. Many of his supporters saw that as an act of political persecution.\n\nAna L\u00facia Martins, a leftwing city councillor in Joinville, a conservative stronghold in Santa Catarina state, said hard-right supporters were portraying \u201cthemselves as the victim for thinking differently\u201d.\n\nDuring the July police raids, four of the 15 search and seize mandates were executed in Joinville. \u201cI think extremism has always existed,\u201d said Martins, \u201cbut there has been a much stronger expression of it in recent years.\u201d\n\nRadde, the former police officer, said there was often a lack of will among typically conservative police forces to tackle such extremism. \u201cSometimes they say: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s bad, but it\u2019s not a crime\u2019.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8e92c9c1-babf-4f4c-97dc-c6746cb51bf6"}}, {"id": "e60c8286-b16b-4ec0-9abf-ab9ae1ee9ad9", "event_name": "The flight from Salvador, a city withered by disease and disorder", "blurb": "The historic migration from Brazil\u2019s interior cities to the coast is now in sharp reverse", "date": "2023-08-0900:00:00.0", "body": "With eyes black and empty, an emaciated family traverses the bone-scattered scrubland as vultures circle above. C\u00e2ndido Portinari\u2019s 1944 painting, Migrants, is an unsparing, haunting depiction of the horrors faced by refugees who fled Brazil\u2019s arid northeastern interior in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nTormented by hunger and drought, hundreds of thousands died. Tens of thousands more migrated to Brazil\u2019s coastal cities, rapidly inflating their populations. But now, a century on, the flows are being reversed. According to new census figures, many of the nation\u2019s large urban coastal centres \u2014 previously a magnet for migrants \u2014 are rapidly shrinking. By contrast, cities and towns in the vast interior are booming as agribusiness brings opportunities to areas which were once barren and inhospitable.\n\nIn the 12 years between this census and the previous survey in 2010, the population of Rio de Janeiro fell by 1.7 per cent, while Porto Alegre, in the south, shrank by 5.4 per cent and Bel\u00e9m, on the Amazonian coast, by 6.5 per cent. But among the big cities, nowhere was the drop as vertiginous as in Salvador, a historic municipality on the northeastern coast in the state of Bahia. It lost almost 10 per cent of its inhabitants \u2014 some 260,000 people.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we had the \u2018rural exodus\u2019 \u2014 people fleeing drought in the interior and ending up at the coast,\u201d says Rodrigo Cerqueira, a demographics researcher at a government statistics institute in Salvador. \u201cNow we are seeing the opposite movement.\u201d\n\nPerched on a long peninsula, bounded by the Atlantic on one side and a large bay on the other, Salvador could make strong claim to be Brazil\u2019s most unique city. Founded almost 500 years ago by the Portuguese as the colonial capital, it is among the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in South America.\n\nToday its historic centre is in varying states of disrepair, with dilapidated tenements abutting centuries-old baroque churches, monuments to the city\u2019s former slaving fortunes. The old town is still dominated by a plaza named pelourinho, after the stone pillars where African slaves were whipped.\n\nThe city today has a proudly Afro-Brazilian culture, boasting African-influenced food, clothing and religion, including candombl\u00e9, a fusion of several west African beliefs that has incorporated elements of Catholicism. But Salvador has long been in economic decline. While in the 20th century, the city surfed on the wealth of the regional cacao trade, it now lacks a motor for growth beyond tourism. With dwindling opportunities and increasing concerns over security and gang violence, many are opting to leave.\n\n\u201cThose who have a little money go to the interior. There they have soyabeans, agriculture, which is providing jobs and improving the region,\u201d said Lello Vasconcelos, who runs a small shop in Salvador\u2019s old town. \u201cHere we have problems with security, education, the issue of violence. Salvador doesn\u2019t have an industry, it doesn\u2019t have social inclusion.\u201d\n\nThe city was also hit badly by the 2015 outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which can cause serious birth defects. Cerqueira, the demographer, believes this, combined with coincident dengue and chikungunya epidemics, affected the birth rate and contributed to the sharp population decline. The interior, on the other hand, has seen a boom in infrastructure and welfare policies. \u201cThe government arrived and built roads, bridges and developed water supplies,\u201d he says. \u201cThis attracted a lot of people back.\u201d\n\nLuis Eduardo Magalh\u00e3es, a city almost 1,000km inland from Salvador, is one such example. Three decades ago the area was desolate scrubland; today it is a hub for the production of soyabeans, most of which are exported to China. Between the last two censuses, the population of the municipality has jumped 80 per cent.\n\n\u201cThey said that the region would not be prosperous, that it was too far from everything,\u201d said Odacil Ranzi, a local farm owner. \u201cToday western Bahia is an example for the state and the country.

It was a greater drop than the 25 basis point cut most economists had expected and the central bank signalled that further reductions of the same magnitude were likely in the months ahead.\n\nLast Friday, Chile became the first big economy in the region to reduce rates post-pandemic, cutting borrowing costs by a full percentage point to take them down to 10.25 per cent.\n\n\u201cEven if the fight against inflation is not finished, Latin American central banks can take a victory lap,\u201d said Ernesto Revilla, chief Latin America economist at Citi in New York. \u201cThey distinguished themselves in this cycle\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009by their discipline, autonomy, commitment and clear communication. Monetary policy in the inflation targeters \u2014 Chile, Brazil, Mexico, Peru and Colombia \u2014 is giving a lesson to the world.\u201d\n\nIn a series of hawkish moves that began in March 2021, Brazil\u2019s rate-setters jacked up the Selic from an all-time low of 2 per cent, countering the inflationary effects of generous public spending and rate cuts unleashed in response to the Covid-19 crisis. The US Federal Reserve did not start raising rates until a year later in March 2022. The European Central Bank was even slower, first tightening policy in July last year.\n\nThe inflation-fighting benefits of Brazil\u2019s early rate rise are now clear.\n\nAfter peaking in low double digits, consumer price growth in Latin America\u2019s largest economy slowed to 3.2 per cent in the 12 months to June, below this year\u2019s official target. In Chile, headline annual inflation is 7.6 per cent, almost half the 14.1 per cent peak recorded in August last year.\n\n\u201cLatin America was ironically more successful because central banks didn\u2019t have the credibility that the Fed had and didn\u2019t have the luxury to say: \u2018Ah, this is just a transitory phenomenon, inflation will go up and come down by itself\u2019,\u201d said Claudio Irigoyen, head of global economics at Bank of America in New York. \u201cThe Fed was probably one year late in the game.\u201d\n\nAlthough Brazil\u2019s central bank has won international plaudits for bringing inflation under control, at home it has faced strong criticism for its hawkishness.\n\nLeftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has accused governor Roberto Campos Neto of \u201cplaying against the Brazilian economy\u201d and has called into question the central bank\u2019s independence, which was granted two years ago under his hard-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nBrazil\u2019s tight monetary policy may have constricted the economy, but it has not killed growth. Economists are upgrading their forecasts after an unexpectedly strong first quarter for the key agricultural sector and Citi expects gross domestic product to expand 2.3 per cent this year.\n\nCristiano Oliveira, chief economist at commercial lender Banco Pine in S\u00e3o Paulo, said before the decision that cutting rates this month was \u201ctechnically the most correct decision\u201d.\n\n\u201cCore inflation measures have shown a strong deceleration, indicating that monetary policy was successful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe [central bank] realised in advance that the main component [of inflation] was strong demand and therefore monetary policy should be tightened.\u201d\n\nWhile it signalled the start of a \u201cgradual\u201d cycle of monetary easing, the Banco Central do Brasil also warned on Wednesday that inflation would increase over the second half of the year.\n\nAndrea Damico, chief economist at asset manager Armor Capital, correctly predicted a 50bp cut.\n\n\u201cA drop in interest rates is not premature. We see a very consistent drop in [inflation] expectations, especially for the long term,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also believe it will probably signal that 50 [basis] points is a suitable pace for the next meeting.\u201d\n\nOther economists think Brazil risks acting too quickly.\n\n\u201cService inflation remains high, inflation expectations are still not fully anchored and the labour market is without slack,\u201d said Alexandre Soriano, head of macro research at Bahia Asset Management in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cIn an environment of significant fiscal expansion, it would make sense for the central bank to postpone the beginning of its cycle of cuts.\u201d\n\nMexico, Latin America\u2019s second-biggest economy, faces a different challenge.\n\nIts close links to the flourishing US economy have kept headline inflation high at 5.1 per cent in the year to June. \u201cInflation in Mexico is still pretty sticky, especially services inflation,\u201d said Irigoyen.\n\nGrowth remains strong.\n\nEconomists polled by Citi expected Banco de M\u00e9xico to postpone rate cuts until December \u2014\u00a0and then are expected to cut them by just a quarter point.\n\nArgentina stands out as an exception among Latin America\u2019s big economies.\n\nThe Peronist government\u2019s fondness for printing money to fund public spending and its heavily distorted official exchange rates have stoked inflation to more than 115 per cent a year. Interest rates in effect stand at an annual level of 155 per cent.\n\nEric Parrado, chief economist at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, praised Latin American central banks\u2019 generally rapid and effective response to inflation. But he warned against overhasty rate cuts.\n\n\u201cThe central banks can\u2019t declare victory yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be careful since there is still a lot of uncertainty over whether the measures of core inflation, without energy and food costs, have established a clear falling trend.\u201d\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nChile offers lessons in the fight to curb inflation\u00a0 /\u00a0From Rosanna Costa, Governor, Central Bank of Chile, Santiago, Chile", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/29371345-70a9-4885-8db4-2a9b2f097beb"}}, {"id": "57412da5-5196-42ef-90c2-86eab1beb5c6", "event_name": "South America braced for economic hit from return of El Ni\u00f1o", "blurb": "Extreme weather phenomenon could spark inflationary surge due to food and energy shortages", "date": "2023-07-3100:00:00.0", "body": "South America is bracing itself for the impact of El Ni\u00f1o, with flooding and droughts intensified by climate change forecast to deliver a $300bn hit to growth for the region\u2019s economies.\n\nAs the planet sweltered from the \u201chottest week on record\u201d in early July, experts declared the return of El Ni\u00f1o, the weather event that warms the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean\u2019s surface and causes global changes in temperature and rainfall.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization advised governments in affected areas, including south-east Asia, Africa, Australia and southern US states as well as South America, to act now \u201cto save lives and livelihoods\u201d.\n\nSouth America, which is dependent on agricultural exports and already vulnerable to rising temperatures, is particularly exposed to the extreme weather that El Ni\u00f1o cycles can bring.\n\nThe phenomenon affects the region unevenly, bringing heavy rains to the Pacific coasts of Peru and Ecuador and droughts to parts of Colombia and Chile, while increasing the likelihood of wildfires in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nCorficolombiana, a Bogot\u00e1-based financial services company, predicts that growth would contract by 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent in Peru and Ecuador, respectively, and 0.6 per cent in Colombia, with economists warning that food and energy shortages could cause another bout of inflation, spurring fresh interest rate rises.\n\n\u201cIf inflation re-accelerates because of El Ni\u00f1o, it may interfere with central banks\u2019 capacity to shift their monetary stance from restrictive to neutral [which supports stable growth],\u201d said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o warms the usually cool and nutrient-rich Humboldt current off Peru and Ecuador\u2019s coastlines and leads fish to migrate away from what are normally some of the world\u2019s most productive fisheries.\n\nOutput in Peru\u2019s fishing industry is projected to shrink by 19.3 per cent this year, according to Lima-based consultancy Thorne & Associates, after the production ministry cancelled the year\u2019s first anchovy fishing season.\n\nThe small fish is used for fishmeal, of which Peru produces 20 per cent of global supply. Total fish production in Peru fell 70 per cent in May from the same month last year.\n\nLima has announced emergency measures worth $1.1bn to tackle the effects of El Ni\u00f1o, including funds for drainage systems, river defences and roads that could be damaged by torrential rain. Health authorities say floods will exacerbate an outbreak of the mosquito-borne dengue disease \u2014 already the country\u2019s worst in decades.\n\nThe measures are on top of a $2.1bn package to boost economic recovery after parts of the country were shut down by violent unrest following the removal of leftwing president Pedro Castillo earlier this year.\n\nBut the country has previously squandered funds allocated to mitigate El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s effects, said Alfredo Thorne, a former finance minister who runs Thorne & Associates, referring to stimulus packages worth $8bn in response to the 2014-16 El Ni\u00f1o cycle.\n\n\u201cInstead of using that money for the prevention of the effects of future El Ni\u00f1o events, the money went to building schools and other public spending,\u201d Thorne said.\n\nEcuador, which lost 300 lives and $3bn in economic output to El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98, also faces agricultural disruption. Banana growers report that 50,000 hectares are at risk, while sugar harvests have been delayed. The government has allocated $266mn to mitigate losses and damage.\n\nIn Colombia, droughts are expected to expose vulnerabilities in the country\u2019s energy grid, about 70 per cent of which is served by hydroelectric power. Economists predict that reservoirs could fall from 65 per cent of capacity to 44 per cent during El Ni\u00f1o, forcing officials to consider increasing generation from fossil fuels.\n\nBogot\u00e1-based think-tank Fedesarrollo predicts a rise in energy bills in Colombia of 50-100 per cent depending on the severity of El Ni\u00f1o.\n\n\u201cEl Ni\u00f1o is already factored into our growth projections,\u201d said finance minister Ricardo Bonilla. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken into account a reduction in the size of harvests due to drought and potential inflationary effects.\u201d\n\nIn drought-hit Chile, scientists linked recent strong rains, the heaviest in 30 years, to a combination of El Ni\u00f1o and climate change.\n\nAuthorities declared an agricultural emergency in two central regions, freeing up funds to help farmers feed animals and provide support for insurance claims. The National Agricultural Society called for significant improvements in water infrastructure and reservoir capacity so they can benefit from heavier rainfall.\n\nIn Brazil, the region\u2019s largest country, El Ni\u00f1o is expected to bring more rain to the south but less farther north, making the Amazon rainforest more susceptible to wildfires.\n\nScientists fear that the impact of El Ni\u00f1o will be amplified by changing climate patterns.\n\n\u201cWe have regions where during the dry season it is already 2.5C hotter and regions where there is 30 per cent less precipitation. El Ni\u00f1o happens on top of that,\u201d said Erika Berenguer, a Brazilian researcher at the UK\u2019s Oxford and Lancaster universities.\n\n\u201cThis increases the likelihood of having forest fires, where everything can go wrong,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Argentina, increased rainfall could benefit the agricultural powerhouse.\n\nThe 2022-23 soyabean harvest was less than half the preceding year, and the government said drought wiped out more than $18bn in forecast export earnings, increasing a severe shortage of dollars in a country blighted by triple-digit inflation.\n\nHowever, the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization has warned that parts of Argentina may suffer excessive rains whose impact on crops is harder to predict.\n\nIn every region, \u201cthe costs of climate variability and climate change\u201d will probably exceed countries\u2019 current estimates, said Justin Mankin and Christopher Callahan of Dartmouth College in the US.\n\nThe academics estimate that this year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o could cost the global economy $3.5tn in lost growth by 2029, with South America bearing about $300bn of that.

Official data suggests the destruction of the rainforest decreased by more than 33 per cent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year.\n\nBrazil is the latest country to launch a bold programme to green its economy. The Joe Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act pledges hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to encourage companies to develop green technology and create jobs in the US.

So it\u2019s really a development plan that tries to harmonise development with a low-carbon economy.\u201d\n\nLula administration officials hope the green transition package will continue beyond his presidency, with a view to fulfilling Brazil\u2019s international commitments to climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nAmong the first initiatives will be legislation for the creation of a regulated carbon market, which will be sent to Congress in the coming months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very confident that it\u2019s not going to be very tough to approve it in Congress, because the sector that is most directly affected \u2014 industry \u2014 is supporting the carbon market,\u201d said an official at the finance ministry.\n\nThe plan also envisages the redeployment of federal funds for research and development to focus on green technologies and the expansion of technical education in the relevant geographic areas, such as biotechnology in the Amazon rainforest or renewable energy in the sun-soaked and gusty north-east.\n\nIt will also target the development of new products and industries based on the diversity of the country\u2019s multiple biomes. Such bioeconomy initiatives have long been championed by environmentalists.\n\nPedro C\u00f4rtes, professor at the Energy and Environment Institute at S\u00e3o Paulo university, said: \u201cBrazil needs to adopt a proactive stance that associates environmental preservation with economic development. For example, biotechnology could use national flora for the development of pharmaceutical products.\u201d\n\nIt is a reality acknowledged by government officials, who admit that the elimination of illegal deforestation and gold mining in the Amazon requires new opportunities in the impoverished region.\n\nThe finance ministry official said: \u201cWe have to put together economic opportunities because otherwise it won\u2019t be sustainable in the medium and long run.\u201d\n\nWith more than 90 per cent of Brazil\u2019s electricity already generated by clean energy \u2014 notably hydropower \u2014 officials want the country to develop as a hub for green technologies, such as renewable hydrogen.\n\nThe official said: \u201cOur challenge is to have more stages of the value chain produced in Brazil. We want to export the technologies necessary to produce renewable hydrogen and [other] technologies for the decarbonisation of our economy.\u201d\n\nThe government estimates the package, which will involve multiple ministries as well as the presidency, will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.\n\nBut it says the bulk of that will come from partnerships with the private sector and private investment.

Despite pledges to overhaul Latin America\u2019s largest economy \u2014 and high expectations for a big green transition package next month \u2014 Lula\u2019s leftwing administration has so far had a decidedly retro feel.\n\nFrom an industrial strategy focused on subsidies and propping up manufacturing to a foreign policy that has loudly reasserted Brazil\u2019s non-aligned credentials, many of the government\u2019s signature policies echo a bygone era, say critics, who are urging a more modern approach.\n\n\u201cOur president wants to impose an outdated leftwing agenda from the 1970s,\u201d said S\u00e9rgio Werlang, a former central bank director now a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. \u201cNowadays it just does not make sense.\u201d\n\nMost prominent are the government\u2019s attempts to prop up industry, which as a sector has shrunk from 48 per cent of economic output in 1985 to less than 24 per cent today. But rather than tackle the root causes of industrial decline \u2014 poor education levels, costly logistics and burdensome bureaucracy \u2014 Bras\u00edlia has focused on handouts.\n\nBetween June and July, the government spent R$650mn ($135mn) subsidising the sale of 125,000 so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s cars\u201d to less well-off citizens. The package was an effort to boost car manufacturing, which has haemorrhaged jobs in recent years. But its impact was fleeting.\n\nAs if to highlight the futility of the strategy, the package was rolled out at the same time as Volkswagen was announcing that it was suspending production in Brazil, citing market stagnation. That followed stoppages by General Motors, Stellantis and Hyundai and others already this year.\n\nBras\u00edlia said it intended to spend $20bn over the next four years to bolster industry, with a focus on supporting \u201csocio-economic inclusion [and] promoting decent work and improved salaries\u201d. But for some their focus is misguided.\n\n\u201cThey think it will preserve more jobs and these jobs are important for growth. But this is the mindset of the 1970s when industry was important in generating jobs. Not now. The world has been changing towards services,\u201d said Werlang.\n\nLula\u2019s political beliefs can often be traced back to his formative years as a trade union activist in the 1970s and 1980s \u2014 a time when manufacturing was a bulwark of growth.\n\nMany of those who surrounded Lula during those years remain influential today, notably Alo\u00edzio Mercadante, who founded the Workers\u2019 party with Lula in 1980. He is now spearheading Brazil\u2019s \u201cneo-industrialisation\u201d push as head of the national development bank.\n\n\u201cI see the government as running short of new ideas. We are seeing the old-minded Workers\u2019 party\u2009[with] ideas from an old world when the state had more power,\u201d said Bruno Carazza, a professor at the Dom Cabral Foundation.\n\nCarazza said the government\u2019s retro mentality was most evident in its foreign policy, particularly its cold war-era outlook on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile emphasising Brazil\u2019s non-aligned status, Lula has claimed Ukraine bears as much responsibility as Russia for the conflict and criticised leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy for \u201cwanting the war\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis [is] Lula paying tribute to an obsolete cold war view that Ukraine was a satellite of Russia, and so the Russians were legitimated to invade,\u201d said Carazza.\n\nOne notable exception to the administration\u2019s retro bent is Fernando Haddad, who has surprised the business community since his appointment as finance minister. Despite longstanding loyalty to Lula, Haddad has walked a fine line to balance Workers\u2019 party interests with market demands for reform and fiscal discipline.\n\nMost notably, he has helped shepherd a long-awaited and widely demanded tax reform, which could be passed by Congress as soon as next month.\n\nThe overhaul, which is expected to boost long-term growth by up to 2.4 per cent, comes amid an increasingly optimistic outlook for the economy, with gross domestic product forecasts for this year being revised up to 2.2 per cent.\n\nMuch of this is being driven by the booming agribusiness sector rather than any kind of industrial or governmental policy. But if life starts to improve for Brazilians, Lula will take the credit, retro style.\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ea462dc4-f220-4d10-8261-ddc57e10261a"}}, {"id": "bda8511a-d9e6-4791-a19c-29a12d8ecd69", "event_name": "Lula holds up EU trade deal in bid to protect Brazil\u2019s domestic industry ", "blurb": "President refuses to sign Mercosur agreement unless Brussels backs down over foreign competition clause", "date": "2023-07-1900:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has ruled out signing a trade deal with the EU unless Brussels eases requirements for Bras\u00edlia to open up its manufacturing industry to foreign competition.\n\nLula, who is in Brussels to try to speed up progress on a trade deal between Brussels and the Mercosur bloc of four South American countries, said he wanted to change rules that would prevent signatories handing government contracts to domestic companies without a competitive process that would be open to foreign firms.\n\nA proposal circulated between the Brazilian, Argentine, Uruguayan and Paraguayan officials that are working on the deal would, Lula said, allow governments to continue to award contracts to smaller domestic firms, as \u201cevery country in the world\u201d does, and support a \u201csovereign industrial policy\u201d.\n\nIt would be presented in Brussels \u201cwithin two to three weeks\u201d, Lula said at a press conference, saying he believed the EU officials would bend to the Latin American countries\u2019 demands.\n\nThe remarks are a fresh obstacle to completing a process that has been beset by delays since a deal was provisionally agreed in 2019 \u2014 despite claims by the Brazilian president on Wednesday that he was \u201cfor the first time\u201d optimistic of concluding talks before the end of this year.\n\nBrussels has also irked the Mercosur quartet by sending a letter that required the group to make binding commitments to protect the rainforest and labour rights.

Preparatory discussions saw some Latin American nations demand the removal of a condemnation of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in the draft conclusions, and tried to add a demand for European reparations for the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nMany of the visiting leaders quite understandably roll their eyes at the recent spike in European interest in their countries, knowing that a quest to buy up their critical raw materials is the main reason.\n\nStill, at least Lula is coming. And for many, whether it ends up a success depends on how he feels when it concludes. While a Mercosur deal is extremely unlikely, positive statements from the Brazilian bellwether on future co-operation would signal some progress for Brussels in its bid for more regional relevance \u2014 and to catch up with China.\n\n\u201cLatin America is not an easy partner,\u201d the FT\u2019s editorial board wrote last week.

But media groups warn that a suggested carve-out pushed by member states, led by France, to allow security services to spy on journalists will have the opposite effect.\n\nTomorrow, the parliament committee responsible for parliament\u2019s take on the use of spyware will vote on its own proposal on the media rules.\n\nAccording to a draft seen by the FT, MEPs want protections against spyware used to access data related to journalists\u2019 work, including accessing information about journalists\u2019 family members or sources.\n\nThe sections on spyware that the MEPs will probably adopt contradict the member states\u2019 position to allow authorities to spy on journalists on national security grounds. Both parliament and the council of member states need to agree before the law can come into force.\n\nRamona Strugariu, the MEP from the liberal Renew group leading the negotiations, said the council\u2019s approach was \u201creally dangerous\u201d. \u201cI think that it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with democracy and freedom of speech,\u201d Strugariu added.\n\nParliament\u2019s counterproposals will enable surveillance tech as a last resort in the investigation of serious crimes, but only if ordered by a judge and not to uncover information relating to a journalist\u2019s professional activity.\n\nGeoffroy Didier, a conservative MEP also responsible for the legislation, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a risk of a clash between the parliament and the council.

It was worth fighting for,\u201d Haddad said.\n\nThe legislation, which will amend the constitution, now faces two more votes in the Senate. If approved in full, the tax overhaul would mark an important political victory for leftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who since taking office in January has had to contend with a legislature dominated by the opposition.\n\nIt could also boost growth, adding as much as 2.39 per cent to gross domestic product over the next eight years, according to estimates from the Institute for Applied Economic Research.\n\n\u201cLasting growth can only happen with tax reform,\u201d said Simone Tebet, government minister for planning and the budget. \u201cIt is the only silver bullet we have.\u201d\n\nLatin America\u2019s largest economy has for decades been hampered by the complexity and opacity of its tax regime.

Total returns of local bonds have also surged ahead of their developed market peers, as chunky inflation-adjusted yields draw the attention of investors.\n\n\u201cWith every month that passes the real yield is getting bigger and bigger,\u201d said Paul Greer, emerging markets debt and FX portfolio manager at Fidelity. \u201cSo more and more investors want to put their money into Latin American currencies for that reason.\u201d\n\nGreer, whose portfolio is overweight in local currency bonds in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay, said that for both government debt and pure currency exposure, Latin America is \u201cthe place to be\u201d. An exception, he said, was Argentina, which has been cut off from access to international markets after a debt default and where inflation runs at more than 100 per cent.\n\nLatin American central banks took the fastest and most decisive action globally when inflationary pressures picked up in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which helped suppress price growth much more quickly than in other regions.\n\nBut high rates have not choked off economic growth. Brazil and Mexico \u2014 the region\u2019s two largest economies by GDP and the most popular among international investors \u2014 both outperformed growth forecasts in the first quarter of this year, prompting economists to raise their projections for the end of the year.\n\nIn Brazil, the poster child for early and aggressive rises, annual inflation is now under 4 per cent, down from more than 13 per cent this time last year, while interest rates have been kept high at 13.75 per cent since August 2022.\u00a0In Mexico, rates have been held at 11.25 per cent since March with headline inflation falling to 6 per cent in May.\n\n\u201cIn places like Brazil or Mexico, now you\u2019re talking 6 per cent and 4 per cent real yields, based on where inflation expectations are, which is a really compelling argument to be adding to those currencies,\u201d said Iain Stealey, chief investment officer of global fixed income at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\n\u201cIs it a crowded trade? Has everyone piled into it? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case yet,\u201d Stealey said, adding foreign ownership of local emerging market bonds is still low following the pandemic and multi-asset investors \u201chaven\u2019t yet moved into emerging market debt\u201d.\n\nPart of the reason investors are being drawn back to Latin America is that market nerves over leftwing governments in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru have been calmed by a lack of congressional majorities that have left them unable to implement many of their policies.\n\nAnd central banks have maintained their independence, ignoring calls from President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in Brazil and President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in Mexico to cut interest rates, arguing that it stifles economic growth.\n\n\u201cDespite all the bluster from the politicians, it has not impacted central bank decisions,\u201d said Geoffrey Yu, senior foreign exchange strategist at BNY Mellon.\n\nYu said another reason for the success of Latin American currencies and bonds in 2023 was years of foreign investors avoiding the region. \u201cThere\u2019s been practically no positioning \u2014 so it\u2019s an easy trade. It\u2019s a good time to buy bonds before central banks start cutting rates.\u201d\n\nThe worry for currency investors now is that the rally will run out of steam as central banks start cutting rates ahead of other regions. Chile is poised to start lowering this month, investors say, followed by Peru and Brazil in August and Colombia and Mexico by the end of the year.\n\nDaniel Ivascyn, chief investment officer at Pimco, said: \u201cAt these levels we have a little less conviction on the [Mexican] peso, which has had a combination of very strong performance and relatively low volatility.\u201d\n\nBut he said bonds in Mexico and Brazil \u201care starting to look interesting\u201d as inflation pulls back and the prospect of rate cuts draws closer. \u201cThey understand the cost of being late on inflation. At least the opportunity for more sustained performance is there,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile some investors say the Mexican peso is starting to look overvalued, if central banks cut rates slowly, currencies across the region could continue to perform well. Greer said he is still betting in the major South American currencies because \u201cinflation will continue to fall faster than central banks will dare to cut interest rates\u201d.\n\nMexico in particular has some attractive long-term structural advantages, as key beneficiary of \u201cfriendshoring\u201d of US companies out of China to lower-cost, closer labour markets, and a surge in remittances boosted by a tight US labour market. It also has among the most stable finances in the region, boosted by fiscal restraint in response to the pandemic, but is one of the most sensitive emerging markets to any slowing in the US economy.\n\nDespite the risks, Jim Cielinski, global head of fixed income at Janus Henderson, said emerging and developing markets in general \u201clook much better positioned in aggregate than their developed market peers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe would expect the Mexican peso and Brazilian real to be higher by the end of the year,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c04c3a04-8c36-4822-813b-28f25e2ba067"}}, {"id": "bfbca7b9-e959-4c09-9b3a-5ca28d2bbd44", "event_name": "Brazilian brokerage XP looks to life after the lockdown bull market", "blurb": "Fintech\u2019s chief says improving economic picture will boost recovery following group\u2019s bumpy comedown from pandemic frenzy", "date": "2023-07-0200:00:00.0", "body": "Like many digital brokerages which prospered during the pandemic as locked-down savers played a booming stock market, Brazil\u2019s XP has had a bumpy comedown.\n\nWith an array of products including a fund \u201csupermarket\u201d and often lower fees than the country\u2019s handful of big banks, the S\u00e3o Paulo-based company has helped bring investing to a wider public since its founding more than two decades ago.

XP\u2019s platform still only commands 11 per cent of the retail investment market by assets under custody in Latin America\u2019s largest economy, which remains dominated by the country\u2019s top high-street banks.\n\nIn a statement of intent, Maffra said the company aimed to roughly double its share to reach the level of Ita\u00fa Unibanco, the region\u2019s largest banking and financial conglomerate, which he estimated was at about 20 to 25 per cent. Ita\u00fa is also a large XP shareholder with an 8.6 per cent stake.\n\nIn parallel to its core activity, the company has diversified into areas such as credit cards, insurance and pensions.\n\nJos\u00e9 Berenguer, an industry veteran who heads XP\u2019s bank, said this would reduce exposure to volatility.\u00a0\u201cWe are an investment house.

He said he would not give up on Brazil, and rounded on his political opponents, claiming democracy itself had been attacked.\n\nThe trial at the electoral court focused on whether Bolsonaro had committed an abuse of political power and misuse of the media when he hosted foreign ambassadors in July last year to air doubts about the reliability of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines.\n\nOpponents said the meeting was a ploy to fuel distrust in the integrity of the elections that Bolsonaro went on to lose. It was broadcast on live TV as well as social networks YouTube, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nBenedito Gon\u00e7alves, the judge who co-ordinated the case, said Bolsonaro had \u201cdelivered a deceitful monologue about electronic voting and the electoral justice system\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. using scraps of false information already so naturalised in his rhetoric\u201d.\n\nThe court also accepted into evidence a draft document found in January in the home of Bolsonaro\u2019s justice minister, Anderson Torres, that outlined steps to overturn the result of the election. The court said the document showed a broader strategy to cast doubt on the electoral system.\n\nBolsonaro had denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the meeting with ambassadors was for governmental, not electoral, purposes.\n\n\u201cI did not attack the voting system. I just showed its possible flaws,\u201d said Bolsonaro, who plans to appeal against the verdict at the supreme court.\n\nThe eight-year ban, which runs retroactively from the first round of last year\u2019s election in October, means Bolsonaro will be barred from contesting any polls \u2014 local, state or federal \u2014 until 2030. He is, however, allowed to remain politically active and the former president said he wanted to stay \u201c100 per cent\u201d engaged.\n\nA conservative nationalist, Bolsonaro still enjoys broad popular support, particularly in Brazil\u2019s rural interior states and among agricultural and evangelical Christian communities, who applaud his message of \u201cGod, family and country\u201d.\n\nHis Liberal party has set a target of winning more than 1,000 out of a possible 5,000 mayoral races in local elections next year.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro achieved something amazing \u2014 he created a movement.

The myriad criminal groups that operate in the Amazon, including illegal loggers, ranchers and gold miners, accelerated their activities last year to maximise profits ahead of Bolsonaro\u2019s anticipated election defeat in October, environmentalists said.\n\n\u201cIt was a perfect storm.

Much of these losses were related to cocoa production, gold mining and fires and occurred within areas of protected woodland.\n\nHowever, signs of positive change were seen in Malaysia and Indonesia, whose rates of tropical primary forest loss have declined to near record-low levels in recent years. Indonesia was the standout example, with non-fire-related deforestation falling 75 per cent since 2016.\n\nAnother hopeful finding was that overall global tree cover loss, which includes the loss of man-made as well as natural forests as a result of human or natural causes, declined about 10 per cent last year.\n\nThis was largely due to fewer forest fires in Russia, the report said, adding that 2022 was a \u201crelatively quiet year for fires globally\u201d with fire-related losses declining by almost a third compared with 2021.\n\n\u201c[The improvement was] more a factor of weather patterns than of human action to combat forest loss,\u201d said Mikaela Weisse, director of Global Forest Watch.

South Africa is due to host the group, which also includes Brazil, Russia, India and China, in August.\n\nYellen suggested it would be difficult for countries to find viable replacements for a currency that has dominated trade for decades.\n\n\u201cThere is a very good reason why the dollar is used widely in trade and that\u2019s because we have deep, liquid, open capital markets, rule of law and long and deep financial instruments,\u201d she said in Paris at a press conference to close the summit.\n\nHer comments came as China pushes for greater international adoption of the renminbi. Russia has switched to using the renminbi as one of its main currencies for international reserves and overseas trade in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe freezing of $300bn worth of Russian central bank assets by Ukraine\u2019s western allies \u2014\u00a0most of which were held in dollars and euros \u2014\u00a0has sparked concerns that Washington will more regularly use its currency\u2019s global dominance as a vehicle for its foreign policy aims.\n\nUS authorities in 2021 seized assets belonging to Afghanistan\u2019s central bank that were held at the New York Federal Reserve. Yellen said such sanctions were only imposed \u201con countries that are guilty of enormous abuses, including human rights abuses\u201d.\n\nWhile some central banks have responded to the sanctions on Russia\u2019s central bank by buying gold, they still keep just under 60 per cent of their reserves in the US currency, according to IMF data.\n\nThe dollar remains the most common global currency for exports.

Bolsonaro has been marginalised from the political mainstream since his supporters in January stormed and vandalised Brazil\u2019s congress, supreme court and presidential palace.\n\nThe trial will examine whether he committed an abuse of political power and misuse of media when he hosted foreign ambassadors in July last year to air doubts about the reliability of Brazil\u2019s electronic voting machines.\n\nThe meeting, which opponents say was a ploy to fuel distrust in the integrity of the elections that Bolsonaro went on to lose, was broadcast on live TV as well as social networks YouTube, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nIf convicted, 68-year-old Bolsonaro would become ineligible to run for any political office for eight years, thwarting any hopes of a rapid comeback.\n\n\u201cThe expectation is that he will become ineligible. There is a lot of evidence against him. And this was all before the events of the January insurrection,\u201d said Denilde Holzhacker, a political scientist at ESPM, a university in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the meeting with ambassadors was for governmental, not electoral, purposes, and that it was legitimate for a president to express doubts about the electoral system.\n\nIn an interview with newspaper Folha de S.Paulo as the trial began on Thursday, the former president said he wanted to stay \u201c100 per cent active in politics\u201d and that any verdict of ineligibility would be an \u201caffront\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat I did over the course of four years is something to be studied.

He attacked the electoral process, claiming that the electronic voting machines used by Brazilian authorities were unreliable and calling for a paper ballot instead. He constantly hinted at the risk of the election being stolen, echoing claims made by Donald Trump in the US.\n\nBut in the end, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s win in October was accepted without serious challenge by Bolsonaro and the veteran leftwing politician was inaugurated on January 1.\n\nThe fact that the election was not seriously challenged is a testament to the strength of Brazil\u2019s institutions. But it was also in part the result of a quiet, year long pressure campaign by the US government to urge the country\u2019s political and military leaders to respect and safeguard democracy, which has not been widely reported.\n\nThe aim was to drum home two consistent messages to restive generals in Brazil and Bolsonaro\u2019s close allies: Washington was neutral on the election result but would not stand for any attempt to question the voting process or the result.\n\nThe Financial Times has spoken to six former or current US officials involved in the effort, as well as to several key Brazilian institutional figures, to piece together the story of how the Biden administration engaged in what one former top state department official calls a \u201cvery unusual\u201d messaging campaign in the months leading up to the vote, using both public and private channels.\n\nAll were at pains to underline that most of the credit for saving Brazil\u2019s democracy in the face of Bolsonaro\u2019s onslaught belongs to the Brazilians themselves and to their democratic institutions, which held firm in the face of extraordinary challenges from a president bent on retaining power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Brazilian institutions that really made sure that the elections took place,\u201d says a senior US administration official. \u201cWhat was important was that we conveyed the right messages and maintained policy discipline.\u201d\n\nThe US had a clear geopolitical incentive to want to demonstrate a capacity to shape events in the region. Long the dominant outside power in Latin America, it has seen its influence eroded in recent years by a growing Chinese presence.\n\nThe administration also had a more direct motivation. After the January 6 insurrection by Trump supporters at the Capitol in Washington attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, President Joe Biden felt very strongly about any attempt by Bolsonaro to question the outcome of a free and fair election, US officials say.\n\nThe campaign was not without risk. The US has been frequently criticised in the region for interfering in its internal affairs; in 1964 Washington backed a military coup in Brazil that overthrew the government of leftist president Jo\u00e3o Goulart and ushered in a 21-year dictatorship.\n\nThose events fuelled longstanding scepticism of the US among the Brazilian left, including Lula, who in 2020 said Washington was \u201calways behind\u201d efforts to undermine democracy in the region.\n\nThe Biden administration had to find a way to get its message across without the US becoming a political football in a fiercely contested election.\n\nThe solution was a concerted but unannounced campaign across multiple branches of the US government, including the military, the CIA, the state department, the Pentagon and the White House. \u201cThis was a very unusual engagement,\u201d says Michael McKinley, a former top state department official and ex-ambassador to Brazil.\n\n\u201cIt was almost a calendar year of strategy, being carried out with a very specific objective in mind, not to support one Brazilian candidate over another, but heavily focused on the [electoral] process, on making sure the process worked.\u201d\n\nThe effort began, according to former top state department official Tom Shannon, with the visit of Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan to Brazil in August 2021. An embassy statement said the visit \u201creaffirmed the longstanding strategic relationship between the United States and Brazil\u201d but Sullivan left his meeting with Bolsonaro worried, according to Shannon.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro continued to talk about fraud in US elections and continued to understand his relationship with the United States in terms of his relationship with President Trump\u201d, says Shannon, who is also a former US ambassador to Brazil and maintains close contacts in the country.\n\n\u201cSullivan and the team that went with him came away thinking that Bolsonaro was entirely capable of attempting to manipulate election results or deny them as [Donald] Trump had done. So there was a lot of thought put into how the United States could be supportive of the electoral process without appearing to be interfering. And that\u2019s how it starts.\u201d\n\nAs election season began, Brazil was a political tinderbox. The country was profoundly divided between Bolsonaro, a former army captain and close ally of Trump, and Lula, a leftwing icon whose achievements in reducing poverty in his first two terms had been overshadowed by a corruption conviction and a jail term. Lula was released early and his conviction was later overturned on procedural grounds.\n\nThe risks to Brazil\u2019s democracy were clear in a country with a modern history of military dictatorship. Bolsonaro had lionised the regime which ran Brazil from 1964 to 1985, and in his first term had showered the armed forces and police with praise and money, raising their budgets and handing key government positions to serving military officers.\n\nIn August 2021, he ordered tanks to roll past congress and the supreme court in a parade on the day legislators were voting on his ultimately unsuccessful proposal to reinstate paper ballots.\n\nSome generals were uncomfortable with Bolsonaro\u2019s attempts to politicise an institution which had tried to stay out of politics since returning power to civilians in 1985 and were worried about the risks of the military stepping outside the constitution. Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, Bolsonaro\u2019s vice-president, was one of those.\n\nShannon recalls a visit by Mour\u00e3o to New York for a private lunch with investors last July, while tensions were running high. After batting away questions about the risks of a coup, repeating that he was confident Brazil\u2019s armed forces were committed to democracy, Mour\u00e3o entered a lift to leave and the former ambassador joined him.\n\n\u201cAs the door was closing, I said to him: \u2018You know your visit here is very important. You heard from people around the table regarding their concerns. And I share those concerns and, quite frankly, I\u2019m very worried. Mour\u00e3o turned to me and he said: \u2018I\u2019m very worried too\u2019.\u201d Mour\u00e3o\u2019s spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThat same month Bolsonaro formally launched his bid for re-election. \u201cThe army\u201d, he told supporters, \u201cis on our side.\u201d\n\nA few days before the campaign announcement, the president redoubled efforts to cast doubt on the electoral process. He summoned around 70 ambassadors to a meeting in Bras\u00edlia and made a presentation questioning the reliability of Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system. The country helped pioneer electronic voting in 1996 and is the only nation in the world to collect and count votes entirely digitally.\n\nNow, Bolsonaro was suggesting the machines were prone to fraud. Alarmed US officials decided they needed to step up their messaging campaign. Bolsonaro, they reasoned, had drawn the international community into the voting machine controversy by calling the meeting and Washington now needed to make its views even clearer.\n\nThe next day, the state department issued an unusual endorsement of the voting system, saying that \u201cBrazil\u2019s capable and time-tested electoral system and democratic institutions serve as a model for nations in the hemisphere and the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe statement by the US was very important, especially for the military,\u201d one top Brazilian official says. \u201cThey get equipment from the US and do training there, so having good relations with the US is very important for the Brazilian military\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The statement was an antidote against military intervention.\u201d\n\nA week later, secretary of defence Lloyd Austin used a visit to a regional defence ministers\u2019 meeting in Bras\u00edlia to send a clear message. Military and security forces needed to be under \u201cstrong civilian control\u201d, he said in a speech.\n\nIn private, Austin and other officials spelt out to Brazil\u2019s military the consequences of supporting any unconstitutional action, such as a coup. \u201cThere would be significant negative ramifications for the bilateral military-to-military relationship if they were to do something and they needed to respect the outcome of the election\u201d, a senior administration official says.\n\nFurther reinforcement of the message to Brazil\u2019s top brass came from General Laura Richardson, head of US Southern Command which covers Latin America, during visits last September and in November 2021, officials said. CIA chief William Burns also came and told the Bolsonaro administration not to mess with the elections.\n\n\u201cThe secretary of defence, the head of the CIA, the national security adviser all visited in an election year,\u201d says McKinley. \u201cIs this usual? No, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThe US also provided some practical help to the election process, helping to overcome supply chain difficulties to obtain components, especially semiconductors, needed to manufacture new machines. The former US ambassador to Brazil, Anthony Harrington, was able to leverage connections inside chipmaker Texas Instruments to, he says, \u201cdistinguish semiconductor needs and give priority to the impact on democratic elections\u201d.\n\nThe US state department and some senior Brazilian officials also asked Taiwanese authorities to give priority to Brazil\u2019s need for semiconductors made by Nuvoton, a Taiwanese company, which are used in the voting machines, according to two sources.\n\nAt the same time as the US was conducting its own messaging campaign, key figures in Brazil\u2019s institutions were holding their own private meetings with military chiefs to try to persuade them to stay within the bounds of the constitution and raising the alarm abroad about the risks of a coup. Some of those involved have spoken to the FT, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions. Many still prefer to avoid any mention of their roles.\n\nA senior Brazilian official who was closely involved recalls that Bolsonaro\u2019s navy minister, Admiral Almir Garnier Santos, was the most \u201cdifficult\u201d of the military chiefs. \u201cHe was really tempted by more radical action,\u201d says the official. \u201cSo we had to do a whole lot of dissuasion work, the state department and the US military command said they would tear up the [military] agreements with Brazil, from training to other types of joint operations.\u201d\n\nAt a tense dinner in late August with military chiefs lasting until two in the morning, key civilian figures attempted to persuade them that the voting machines were not rigged against Bolsonaro and that they should respect the election.\n\nThe timing was crucial: Bolsonaro was calling for mass demonstrations in his support on Brazil\u2019s independence day, September 7. Garnier did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLu\u00eds Roberto Barroso, a supreme court judge who at the time headed Brazil\u2019s electoral court, says he also played a part in soliciting the statement from the US state department.\n\n\u201cI asked [Douglas Koneff, then acting US ambassador to Brazil] a couple times\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009for declarations about the integrity and credibility of our voting system and the importance of our democracy,\u201d Barroso recalls. \u201cHe did make a statement, and more than that he got the state department to make a statement supporting democracy in Brazil and the integrity of the system.\u201d\n\nThe US embassy declined to comment on details of confidential meetings held during the election period.\n\nAs the election neared, senior US officials believed that Bolsonaro also needed to hear from more voices within his own circle.\n\nThey identified key lieutenants and political allies, not all of whom were happy about the president\u2019s attempts to stay in power whatever happened, to urge him to respect the results of the election.\n\nArthur Lira, head of the lower house of congress, vice-president Mour\u00e3o, Tarc\u00edsio Gomes de Freitas, Bolsonaro\u2019s infrastructure minister, and Admiral Fl\u00e1vio Rocha, the secretary of strategic affairs in the presidency, were all conduits for US messages about the need to protect the integrity of the elections, according to those involved.\n\nUS officials stayed in regular communication with them and other key figures in the Bolsonaro government. \u201cWe got the sense that the people around Bolsonaro were urging him to do the right thing,\u201d a senior administration official says.\n\nIn the October 2 vote no candidate won an overall majority. But after the run-off vote later that month, it became clear that Lula had scored a narrow yet unarguable victory.\n\nSeveral key Bolsonaro allies including de Freitas and Lira, quickly recognised the leftist\u2019s win. \u201cWithin 24 hours they accepted the results of the second round,\u201d McKinley says. \u201cWhat a blow to anyone who was thinking there was room to challenge the results.\u201d\n\nShocked by the result, Bolsonaro disappeared from public view and did not concede, but reluctantly ordered officials to co-operate with a transfer of power.\n\nAs Lula\u2019s January 1 inauguration approached, tensions continued. On December 12, pro-Bolsonaro rioters attacked police and set fire to vehicles in Bras\u00edlia. A week later, the former army captain attended a dinner with some more moderate members of his inner circle, one of those present says.\n\nWith doubts over his willingness to hand the presidential sash over to Lula at the inauguration, some of Bolsonaro\u2019s allies sought to persuade him to bring forward his plans to travel abroad and to skip the inauguration, the person present says.\n\nWhen Bolsonaro left Brazil for Florida two days before Lula was sworn in, the Americans, along with many Brazilians, breathed a sigh of relief. But the danger had not passed.\n\nOn January 8, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters staged an insurrection in Bras\u00edlia, storming congress, the supreme court and the presidential palace demanding military intervention. Brazil\u2019s military did intervene within hours \u2014 but to quash the protests. More than 1,000 demonstrators were arrested.\n\nPolice investigators would later find draft documents in the possession of Bolsonaro\u2019s justice minister, Anderson Torres, and one of his closest aides, army Lieutenant-Colonel Mauro Cid, which outlined steps to overturn the results of the election and maintain power.\n\nTorres, who spent five months in jail this year as he awaits trial, says the document found in his home was \u201cleaked out of context\u201d and \u201cwithout legal validity\u201d. Cid could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe US decided to make one last push in favour of respecting the election. Biden was in Mexico at the time of the insurrection for a North American leaders\u2019 summit, and saw what was happening on the news. \u201cHe asked right then to speak with Lula,\u201d says a senior administration official. \u201cAfter the call, he proposed to Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and to Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador that we issue a trilateral joint statement supporting Lula and Brazil. It was a first of its kind for North America.\u201d\n\nWith the rioters arrested, the military under control and Lula in power, Brazil\u2019s democracy appears to have survived the potential threat.\n\nFor the Biden administration, relations with Brazil have improved but there has still been friction with the new government. Lula showed little public recognition of the US campaign to protect the election. His first official visit to Washington in February was a low-key affair lasting a day.\n\nIn April he took a big delegation to China for a three-day, two-city tour. On that trip, Lula rejected US sanctions on Huawei, the Chinese tech company, lashed out at the west\u2019s military support for Ukraine and endorsed Beijing\u2019s drive for alternatives to the US dollar.\n\nA spokesperson for Lula insists that he talked in Washington about \u201cdefending democracy and threats from the extreme right\u201d and that a longer trip to the US is being considered.\n\n\u201cPeople here understand that there are going to be political differences,\u201d says Shannon. \u201cBut there\u2019s a tone of anger and resentment underlying all of this which really caught people by surprise\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It\u2019s as if he doesn\u2019t know or doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge what we did.\u201d\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nWhy US should take pride in Brazil\u2019s democratic vote\u00a0/\u00a0From Benjamin H Bradlow, Assistant Professor of Sociology and International Affairs, Princeton University, NJ, US\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/07533564-2231-47a6-a7b8-2c7ae330efc5"}}, {"id": "ba221b8d-efb2-4d3d-b1b8-d9f6555aec87", "event_name": "Petrobras CEO says not keeping oil reserves up would be \u2018fatal error\u2019", "blurb": "Brazilian oil major is trying to overcome opposition to plans for drilling off the mouth of the Amazon river", "date": "2023-06-2100:00:00.0", "body": "The new boss of Petrobras said it would be a \u201cfatal error\u201d not to replenish its oil reserves, as the Brazilian state-controlled company tries to overcome opposition to plans for drilling off the mouth of the Amazon river.\n\nJean Paul Prates, who took the helm of Latin America\u2019s largest oil and gas producer this year, argued securing more crude deposits was vital in parallel to preparing for the energy transition.\n\nPetrobras is appealing against a decision by Brazil\u2019s environment agency, which recently rejected its request to set up an exploratory well 175km from the country\u2019s northern coastline.\n\nThe deepwater block is in an area of the Atlantic Ocean seen as one of the next frontiers for extraction, but campaigners say the site in question is ecologically rich and fragile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new horizon for us,\u201d Prates told the Financial Times in an interview at the group\u2019s Rio de Janeiro headquarters. \u201cWe have to worry about replenishing reserves. We can\u2019t simply [say] no more oil and it\u2019s over. For an oil company, this is not possible.\n\n\u201cYou would be making the biggest mistake of your life. That would be a fatal error, which would decree the death of the company in 30 years.\u201d\n\nThe former senator was chosen as chief executive by leftwing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who took office in January promising significant changes at the $87bn-valued business.\n\nLula has demanded Petrobras play a greater role in the shift to low-carbon energy with investments in activities such as renewables and biofuels.\n\nBut he also wants the company to increase refining capacity to make Brazil self-sufficient in oil products. At the same time, Lula has criticised high dividends paid by Petrobras on the back of bumper profits, unnerving some minority shareholders.\n\nFounded 70 years ago as Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro, the business is listed on the stock market but the government is its biggest shareholder.\n\nPrates said it needed to be an \u201cintegrated energy company\u201d to confront future challenges and that fossil fuel revenues would help fund clean energy investments.\n\n\u201cIn the energy transition this is important, because in an oil company the present pays for the future,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to reinvent [yourself] to be something else in 30 years. You probably won\u2019t be selling oil and gas, or very little.\u201d\n\nWith output from Petrobras\u2019 existing \u201cpre-salt\u201d fields \u2014 rich offshore deposits under a 2km-thick layer of sodium chloride \u2014 forecast to peak by the end of the decade, there will be a pressing need for new sources of income.\n\nHowever, diversification would reverse the strategy behind a successful turnround of recent years. The company has sold non-core assets such as petrol stations and refineries in order to focus on pumping deep-sea oil and reduce borrowings.\n\nFor some, the prospect of increased government influence has stirred memories of past mis-steps that caused considerable financial damage.\n\nDuring the last period of leftwing rule in Brazil, Petrobras was at the centre of a massive political corruption scandal and racked up huge debts after investing heavily in offshore production and being forced to keep diesel artificially cheap under president Dilma Rousseff. Expensive refinery projects went over budget or unfinished.\n\nCorporate governance has since been strengthened and Prates, a 54 year-old politician from Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party with industry experience, insisted there would be no repeat of the mistakes.\n\n\u201cMy message is very strong.

So you need to prepare for this volume of oil that you are producing to be used in a noble way.\u201d\n\nLocal media have suggested Petrobras might make a bid for Braskem, Latin America\u2019s biggest petrochemicals producer, in which it already owns a 36 per cent equity holding.\n\nA controlling stake in the $5bn-valued company is up for sale by Braskem\u2019s largest shareholder, the construction conglomerate Novonor. Offers have been tabled by Brazilian chemicals group Unipar Carbocloro and a consortium of US private equity group Apollo and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.\n\nPetrobras has the first right of refusal in the event of any buyout bid. Prates said no decision had yet been made, but added: \u201cIt is important that [Braskem] remains under Brazilian control, not necessarily for ideological reasons, but as an issue of national strategy.\u201d\n\nMarcelo de Assis from consultancy Wood Mackenzie questioned the logic of the state-controlled group returning to sectors it had left, as well as the government using it to advance a green agenda.\n\n\u201cIs Petrobras the best company to do this?\u201d he added. \u201cWhy would you move from profitable [exploration and production] to a more diverse company with lower profitability?\u201d\n\nA more immediate concern for minority shareholders is how Petrobras charges for fuel \u2014 a politically sensitive topic in Brazil. Previous rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro fired three CEOs in less than a year and a half, following disputes over the issue.\n\nTo fulfil Lula\u2019s promise to \u201cBrazilianise\u201d fuel prices, management has ditched a practice of moving diesel and gasoline in line with the dollarised rates importers pay.\n\nAnalysts have criticised the new pricing policy as unclear. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to work when oil prices spike or the exchange rate depreciates,\u201d said Luiz Carvalho at UBS BB. \u201cWill they be able to increase fuel prices by the same amount?\u201d\n\nPrates insisted international crude benchmarks will remain a factor in the calculations, with no handouts. \u201cPetrobras does not subsidise anything,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/958773d5-c11f-47db-85c0-a7f78a2b1af7"}}, {"id": "6124a4f4-a0f5-44e5-ad34-15df0d908375", "event_name": "Lula struggles with rightwing Congress as Brazil\u2019s \u2018broad coalition\u2019 unravels", "blurb": "Leftwing leader must manage ties with emboldened parliamentary bloc after damaging defeats ", "date": "2023-06-1800:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s rightwing Congress is threatening to frustrate key pillars of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s political agenda after accusing the leftwing leader of spending too little time on the country\u2019s deteriorating domestic politics and too much on foreign policy.\n\nThe 77-year-old, elected last year on sweeping pledges to kick-start the economy, eradicate poverty and protect the environment, is facing the reality of governing with an opposition-dominated legislature, which has handed him a series of defeats.\n\nThe acrimonious clashes with Congress, which does not support much of Lula\u2019s agenda, have the potential to cast a pall over the president\u2019s third non-consecutive term. According to a survey released earlier this month by pollster Ipec, Lula\u2019s popularity has slipped from 41 per cent in March to 37 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe elected Congress is not a progressive leftist Congress,\u201d said Arthur Lira, speaker of the lower house, in a message to Lula. \u201cIt is a reformist, [economically] liberal, conservative Congress. The government has been counting on the goodwill of [parliament]\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but this is running out.\u201d\n\nThe comments last week followed parliamentary votes to strip key powers from the environment ministry and the newly created ministry of indigenous people as part of an administrative reconfiguration of Lula\u2019s cabinet. In a separate vote, the lower house of parliament also voted in favour of a bill that would limit indigenous people\u2019s claims to land.\n\nBoth decisions were seen as a direct rebuke of Lula, whose key priorities include protecting the environment and Brazil\u2019s native peoples. Congress has also indicated it would oppose any attempts to roll back recent economic reforms, including pro-business regulatory frameworks, privatisations and labour laws.\n\n\u201cLula has been suffering defeats because the legislature has more power,\u201d said Eduardo Grin, a politics professor of Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation. \u201cCongress reflects the increasing conservatism in society\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[so] it feels much more supported by society to block the president\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nSince taking office for his third term in January, Lula has focused much of his time on foreign affairs, pitching plans for a \u201cpeace club\u201d to end the Ukraine war and re-establishing ties with the regime led by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela.\n\nHe drew the ire of many lawmakers on Brazil\u2019s right by recently hosting Maduro in Bras\u00edlia and offering his support to the autocratic leader.\n\nAn editorial in the right-leaning Estad\u00e3o newspaper said the move \u201cdestroyed once and for all the very fragile \u2018broad coalition\u2019 that elected Lula\u201d, adding that the move was \u201cincomprehensible given [Lula\u2019s] pressing need to improve his ability to govern\u201d.\n\nAlessandro Vieira, a centre-right senator, told the Financial Times that Lula was facing a \u201cdifficult balance\u201d between domestic and foreign policy. \u201cHe is going through a process of adaptation to the reality of Congress, which is very different from that of his first administrations [from 2003-2010].\u201d\n\nThe success of Lula\u2019s domestic agenda will hinge closely on how he manages the relationship with Lira, a centre-right politician who represents a powerful parliamentary bloc known as the Centr\u00e3o, analysts said.\n\nUnwedded to ideology, the Centr\u00e3o offers support to governments of any stripe in exchange for plum political posts and the resources to support its electoral machine in home constituencies.\n\nThe bloc expanded its influence during the previous administration led by far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, which \u2014 embattled by scandals \u2014 handed over more power and influence to Lira.\n\n\u201cLira is today effectively a kind of prime minister,\u201d said Fernando Sch\u00fcler, a political analyst at Insper, a university in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cLula has strength, but this strength is conditioned on the preservation of the relationship with Lira.\u201d\n\nLira has shown support for certain planks of the government\u2019s economic agenda, including a new fiscal framework to ease constraints on spending and a proposed overhaul of the country\u2019s byzantine tax system.\n\nBut he has played hardball on issues close to Lula\u2019s leftwing base, including protection of the environment and minorities and attempts to roll back the privatisation of the water and sewage sector.\n\n\u201cI am committed to regaining Brazil\u2019s world leadership in mitigating climate change and controlling deforestation,\u201d Lula said after the Congress setbacks. \u201cWe once again have an active and proud foreign policy, which makes us protagonists of the great discussions involving climate change.\u201d\n\nOf the lower house\u2019s 513 members, Lula\u2019s bloc only amounts to about 220 lawmakers. His position is marginally better in the Senate. Although he can count reliably only on 14 of the chamber\u2019s 81 members, he has the support of Senate leader Rodrigo Pacheco.\n\nParliament\u2019s new confidence has been evidenced by its demands for bigger rewards and concessions for passing legislation than the ministerial posts that are traditionally offered to Centr\u00e3o parties.\n\nAt the beginning of his government, Lula handed three ministerial positions to the rightwing Uni\u00e3o Brasil party. Yet in the recent vote to limit indigenous territories, only two of its 59 lawmakers voted alongside the government.\n\nThe other carrot typically employed by presidents to cajole Congress are discretionary budgetary stipends, which lawmakers use to invest in their constituencies and bolster their political stature\n\nBut the price of such incentives has risen for Lula as opposition lawmakers have restricted his room for manoeuvre.\n\nAs Congress stripped power from his ministries this month, Lula released R$1.7bn ($350mn) in such stipends to try limit the damage \u2014 the largest single-day release of funds of this type under this government.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b40822e5-80f5-46e1-b968-ae5382a70bc8"}}, {"id": "4fbdf8fd-9c14-4994-9343-57c3ffce02fc", "event_name": "Why Ukraine is tightening anti-graft rules before aid billions start flowing", "blurb": "Also in today\u2019s newsletter: How Europe lost its prime trade relationship with Brazil", "date": "2023-06-1200:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning.

A reconstruction conference will be held in London this month.\n\nUkraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been quick to react to hints of fraud in his government as he continues to plead with western partners for support, while a fraud trial opening in London today pitting Ukraine\u2019s largest bank against its former oligarch owners is seen as a key test of Kyiv\u2019s anti-corruption credentials.\n\nIt\u00e4l\u00e4 said the difficulty with the reconstruction effort would be in ensuring that money coming from myriad international sources went to worthy projects: \u201cWith the Marshall Plan back then it was one donor, now it is many donors.\u201d\n\nOlaf\u2019s offices are busy: Andriy Kostin, prosecutor-general of Ukraine, visited at the end of April to discuss monitoring funds, and talks about Ukrainian access to EU funds dedicated to anti-graft efforts are continuing.

Environmental policy in Brazil draws international attention because it is home to a large portion of the Amazon river and its surrounding rainforest, a store of carbon critical to protecting the earth\u2019s climate. Campaigners say the area around the proposed oil exploration site is ecologically sensitive and near coral reefs.\n\nYet industry figures argue that tapping the wider offshore region in which the block lies, known as the Equatorial Margin, is crucial to the South American nation\u2019s continued status as a globally important energy producer.\n\n\u201cIt would allow the country to maintain its role as one of the largest oil producers in the world,\u201d said Adriano Pires, founder of the energy consultancy CBIE and a former member of the country\u2019s oil regulator.\n\nThe rejection of the drilling plan also dismayed local politicians from coastal areas that stand to benefit from jobs and royalties if production eventually goes ahead.\n\nBut it was welcomed by green activists, who say the basin at the mouth of the Amazon \u2014 home to corals, mangroves and endangered species such as dolphins and whales \u2014 would be vulnerable to harm in the event of a spill.\n\nSuely Ara\u00fajo, senior specialist in public policy at the non-profit Climate Observatory, said: \u201cIn the midst of the climate crisis, the question that must be asked is whether it makes sense for Brazil to position itself as one of the last major oil sellers.\u201d\n\nThe controversy underlines the challenges for Lula as he seeks to balance campaign pledges of ecological protection and economic development in Latin America\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nThe 77-year-old former trade unionist cast himself as champion of sustainability during his successful presidential run last year against far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who oversaw rising destruction of the world\u2019s largest rainforest.\n\nEnergy and mining minister Alexandre Silveira, who previously described exploration in the region as a \u201cpassport to the future\u201d, has criticised the permit refusal and called the regulator\u2019s demands for new studies \u201cincoherent and absurd\u201d.\n\nBut environment minister Marina Silva, who appointed the head of the regulatory agency, defended the process: \u201c[A] technical decision in a republican [and] democratic government is carried out and respected based on evidence.\u201d\n\nAn internationally renowned fighter for green causes, Silva occupied the same post during Lula\u2019s first stint in office \u2014 before quitting in frustration after losing a series of battles over environmental issues, including large infrastructure projects in the Amazon.\n\n\u201cIt is a big fight. This time Silva has more power than she had in [in the past] because today the environmental agenda is stronger,\u201d said Pires.\n\nThe Equatorial Margin is a 2,200km stretch of the Atlantic facing the coastlines of some of Brazil\u2019s poorest states. Oil companies consider it to be a promising new hydrocarbon frontier.\u00a0It is estimated to contain as much as 30bn barrels of oil equivalent, of which about a quarter could be recoverable, according to CBIE.\n\nDiscoveries have been made offshore from neighbouring Suriname and Guyana, with US oil giant ExxonMobil already pumping crude from the latter. Output from Brazil\u2019s other main deep-sea reserves is due to peak by the end of the decade.\n\nPires said: \u201cWe have to find a middle ground, respecting the environment, but without leaving this level of wealth buried underground.\u201d\n\nThe environmental agency, Ibama, vetoed Petrobras\u2019s drilling application on the grounds that it lacked evidence showing that the wider region is suitable for exploration.\n\nIt also said measures outlined for dealing with contaminated wildlife and communication with nearby indigenous communities were inadequate, and criticised the time it would take to respond to any accidents.\n\nEighty civil society and environmental groups, including WWF and Greenpeace, had earlier urged Ibama not to grant a licence until further detailed studies were carried out.\n\nAra\u00fajo, who was formerly the head of Ibama when it rejected a similar request by French oil major TotalEnergies, said the plans did not include an adequate system for coordinating with neighbouring countries in case of accidents. She added: \u201cI do not believe there will be a reversal of the decision.\u201d\n\nAfter the regulatory rebuff, state-controlled Petrobras insisted it had complied with all the requirements of the licensing process. It has promised to include additional measures to protect the environment and said the drilling is a temporary, low-risk activity required to check for the existence of oil reserves.\n\nThe company has allocated almost half its $6bn exploration budget over the next five years to the Equatorial Margin.\n\nThe energy and mining ministry did not respond to a request for comment, while the environment ministry referred questions to Ibama. The agency declined to provide a timeframe for the appeal but said the process must be concluded within a year.\n\nConcerns have mounted that Lula\u2019s environmental agenda may be watered down by a conservative-dominated Congress, after lawmakers recently stripped powers from the environment ministry and the newly created ministry for indigenous peoples. The president has three and a half years of his term remaining.\n\nThe dilemma reflects broader tensions in Brazil between conservation and growth, said Mariana Borges, a political scientist at the University of Oxford. \u201cIt shows that this conflict is still very big within the government and society,\u201d she said.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/800693a0-fc52-408e-83bd-0b8e63f38b3a"}}, {"id": "a45e7d0a-2d02-4371-9984-7ab60bda9d91", "event_name": "Betting scandal deals blow to Brazilian football\u2019s development ", "blurb": "The growing influence of sports gambling has spurred calls for a better legal framework for the industry", "date": "2023-06-0800:00:00.0", "body": "From bent referees and inflated stadium contracts to the theft of the old World Cup trophy, Brazilian football is no stranger to scandal.\n\nThe latest intrigue has a 21st century digital twist.

Prosecutors are treating them as victims, given they paid out on scams. But the controversy has provoked a debate about the growing role of sports gambling at a moment of critical commercial developments in the domestic game.\n\nWith takeovers of teams by foreign capital and proposals afoot to create a new competition backed by big money, the manipulation of at least eight top-flight fixtures has even called into question the integrity of the sport.\n\n\u201cWhether investors in clubs, leagues or media companies that buy the transmission rights, it\u2019s bad for everyone,\u201d says Eduardo Bandeira de Mello, a federal lawmaker and former president of Rio de Janeiro side Flamengo.\n\nSports betting has exploded in popularity since its 2018 legalisation in the soccer-mad South American nation, with online international brands Bet365, Betano and Sportingbet among hundreds targeting punters.\n\nNineteen of the 20 top division clubs carry sponsorship from such sites. Consultancy H2 Gambling Capital predicts R$83bn ($17bn) of wagers in 2023, with R$5.82bn of gross gaming revenue \u2014 forecast to roughly double over the coming years.\n\nYet there is an absence of regulation. As a result, internet bookmakers run from overseas jurisdictions are subject to no Brazilian rules or taxation. Andre Gelfi, president of the Brazilian Institute of Responsible Gambling and a local executive for Swedish group Betsson, reckons this was the main cause behind the fraud. \u201cWithout regulation, you cannot level up to international best practice,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more formalised the market, the more effective the control of criminal activities.\u201d\n\nThe new administration in Bras\u00edlia was already reworking rules drafted but not passed by its predecessor, so the affair could provide fresh impetus.\n\nHowever, a worry is that the political attention it has drawn may slow down the process. The government\u2019s support in Congress is weak and some believe ministers will wait until the end of a parliamentary inquiry into the scandal.\u00a0The continued uncertainty is negative for companies and consumers who have little recourse for complaints in Brazil, says Neil Montgomery, a lawyer specialising in the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for serious operators to establish any long-term plans because the definitive legal framework isn\u2019t in place,\u201d he adds.\n\nIndustry insiders do not expect draconian regulatory measures in reaction to the controversy. Companies will have to apply for licences or face restrictions on advertising and payments processing.\n\n\u201cThe concern for international operators for the medium term is less match-fixing, it\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen to the market when the regulations are in place,\u201d says Jon Moss of 34 Consulting and formerly head of international development at Bet365.\n\nIn his view, aspects of the proposed rules risk pushing consumers towards unregulated portals. These include a 30 per cent tax on winnings above R$2,112 and the fact that virtual blackjack, roulette and slot machines \u2014 a big source of income and popular with gamers \u2014 remain illegal when operated within Brazil, so will have to be removed from legitimate sites.\n\nEven if sports betting is not overly tainted by the rigging racket, lobbyists fear setbacks on a wider campaign to fully liberalise gambling and permit casinos in Brazil.\n\nThe Senate was expected to vote in coming months on a bill to lift a 1940s general ban on games of chance.

In November it allowed Chevron to restart limited oil exports from the country, a move intended to induce Maduro to reopen talks with the opposition.\n\nThe US concession followed a preliminary agreement between the Maduro government and the opposition at Norway-brokered talks that $3bn of frozen Venezuelan funds held in the west should be spent on humanitarian projects.\n\nBut six months later, the funds have yet to be unblocked, the talks have not resumed and time is running out for negotiations that could improve the chances of a free presidential election being held next year.\n\nNo date has been set for the vote, but with the opposition in disarray Maduro has hinted he might bring the ballot forward.\n\n\u201cMaduro\u2009feels no pressure to sit with the opposition and negotiate terms for the election,\u201d said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas programme at the CSIS think-tank in Washington. \u201cEven less so, now that the region is coalescing around him.\u201d\n\nMaduro survived the years of western ostracism by turning to China, Russia, Turkey and Iran and dodging sanctions by sending cargos of oil to east Asia through intermediaries. US officials say his government augmented state coffers by encouraging illegal gold mining in the Amazon rainforest and taking a cut from drug traffickers.\n\nVenezuela has taken a free market turn in recent years, allowing increased use of the US dollar and dismantling some state controls. The IMF said Venezuela\u2019s gross domestic product grew 8 per cent last year and will grow another 5 per cent this year, albeit from a very low base.\n\nThe EU had hoped to exploit Maduro\u2019s desire for greater legitimacy by dangling the prospect of an EU observation mission for next year\u2019s election. But diplomats in Brussels admit that they will not be able to proceed if Caracas fails to make even minimal political concessions.\n\n\u201cThe window of opportunity may close soon,\u201d one senior EU diplomat said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of months.\u201d\n\nThe difficulty for the US and EU is that, after the failure of the Trump-era sanctions and western attempts to recognise an alternative government led by former Congress president Juan Guaid\u00f3, they have few options left.\n\n\u201cEngagement with Maduro is important as he has no intention of going anywhere,\u201d said Tamara Taraciuk Broner, a Venezuela expert at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. \u201cBut that engagement can\u2019t be free, it needs to generate incentives for the Venezuelan authorities to advance in a democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last thing the Venezuelan people need is to have Maduro\u2019s profile raised,\u201d she added. \u201cMaduro has his own narrative about what is happening and Lula\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009gave that narrative more resonance.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Michael Pooler in S\u00e3o Paulo", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/df3ea5a2-743d-41bc-8670-2527d67f92a3"}}, {"id": "dacddec9-3060-4f75-af67-39f520f96d19", "event_name": "Russian concerns on Ukraine must \u2018be taken into account\u2019, says Brazil ", "blurb": "Foreign policy adviser to leftwing president Lula warns western leaders\u2019 stance risks provoking a wider conflict ", "date": "2023-06-0200:00:00.0", "body": "The west must take \u201cinto account\u201d Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s security concerns and stop the slide towards a Versailles-style victors\u2019 peace in Ukraine, said Brazil\u2019s top foreign policy adviser.\n\nCelso Amorim, a foreign minister during President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s first two terms and current adviser on international affairs to the leftwing leader, said the west\u2019s belligerent stance against Moscow risked provoking a wider conflict.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a third world war. And even if we don\u2019t have that, we don\u2019t want a new cold war,\u201d Amorim told the Financial Times. \u201cAll concerns of countries in the region should be taken into account, if you want peace. The only other alternative is total military victory against Russia. Do you know what comes after? I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAlthough Brazil has officially condemned Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Lula has been accused of maintaining \u201cpro-Russian neutrality\u201d. He has repeatedly claimed Kyiv bears equal responsibility with Moscow for the conflict and has accused Washington of \u201cencouraging\u201d the violence. Sergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, visited Bras\u00edlia last month.\n\nAmorim said national security is one of Moscow\u2019s chief \u201cconcerns\u201d, referring to its complaints of \u201cencirclement\u201d by western powers and Nato.\n\n\u201cWe cannot judge the situation by the last 1.5 years. This is a situation of decades. [Russia has] concerns that have to be taken into account. That is not the fault of Ukraine. Ukraine is a victim, a victim of the remnants of the cold war.\u201d\n\nSince returning to the presidency for a third term in January, Lula has sought to bolster Brazil\u2019s international standing and reassert its traditional status as a non-aligned democracy. He has been an outspoken proponent of a \u201cpeace club\u201d of nations to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.\n\nAt the G7 meeting in Hiroshima earlier this month, a meeting between Lula and Volodymyr Zelenskyy was cancelled after the Ukrainian president was late, according to Bras\u00edlia.\n\nLike other Latin American countries, Brazil has refused to send weapons to Ukraine and denied a request from Germany to re-sell it tank ammunition.\n\nWhen Lula last month claimed the US was \u201cencouraging the war\u201d, the White House accused Brazil\u2019s leader of \u201cparroting Russian and Chinese propaganda\u201d. But Amorim, who has visited Kyiv and Moscow in recent weeks, said Bras\u00edlia was concerned by perceived western efforts to weaken Russia, suggesting it would only provoke a larger conflict.\n\n\u201cI am reminded of the situation in Germany after the first world war: The objective was to weaken Germany at [the Treaty of] Versailles and we know where that led.\u201d\n\nThe former foreign minister denied that the legacy of US involvement in Latin America during the cold war had coloured Lula\u2019s view of Washington, pointing out Brazil\u2019s \u201cgood relations\u201d with the US and that the president\u2019s second state visit was to the US capital.\n\nPaulo Velasco, a professor of foreign policy at Rio de Janeiro State University, said Lula\u2019s approach to the Ukraine conflict was in line with traditional Brazilian diplomacy, which avoids \u201cextreme positions that could compromise efforts to reach an understanding\u201d.\n\n\u201cBrazil believes that sanctions are rarely the best path,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tend to isolate the state engaging in deviant behaviour, undermining its trust of the international community, which is essential to come to peaceful agreements.\u201d\n\nOther experts point out Bras\u00edlia is motivated by more pragmatic concerns, including its trade relationship with Russia.\n\nOliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo, said: \u201cLike the vast majority of global south countries, Brazil wants to make sure it can preserve its business ties with Russia. Russia has been an all-weather friend \u2014 low intensity but all weather.\u201d\n\nBilateral trade is worth about $10bn, with large amounts of fertiliser for Brazil\u2019s booming agribusiness sector \u2014 worth almost 30 per cent of GDP \u2014 coming from Russia.\n\nBrazil\u2019s neutrality towards Russia has broad, cross-party support and is a rare point of continuity between Lula and the previous rightwing presidency of Jair Bolsonaro. Shortly before the invasion of Ukraine last year, Bolsonaro visited Moscow to secure fertiliser supplies.\n\nStuenkel added that neither country wants to disrupt their relations within the Brics group of nations, which also includes China, India and South Africa.\n\n\u201cNon-alignment is seen as a safe bet in a world where great power competition will increase. From the Brazilian point of view, the rise of China and re-emergence of Russia is not actually bad\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. that is why [Bras\u00edlia has] no interest in joining [a] western coalition against Russia.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/38b2aac6-967f-4185-bb11-f5161233f020"}}, {"id": "2b6f6ba5-5465-4fba-bb9b-f28ad7f5e8dd", "event_name": "Lula nominates personal lawyer to Brazil\u2019s supreme court", "blurb": "Appointment of \u2018friend and comrade\u2019 angers rightwing opposition and legal experts", "date": "2023-06-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is facing criticism after nominating his personal lawyer, who defended him against corruption charges, to the country\u2019s powerful supreme court.\n\nThe selection on Thursday of Cristiano Zanin to fill a seat on the 11-member bench rapidly drew the ire of opposition figures as well as legal experts, who claim the appointment would be a conflict of interest and could jeopardise the top tribunal\u2019s impartiality.\n\n\u201cIn addition to having been his personal lawyer, Lula has called Zanin his \u2018friend and comrade\u2019. Lula wants to pack the supreme court, but we will not accept it,\u201d said Nikolas Ferreira, a prominent rightwing lawmaker. He said that he had filed an injunction to stop the nomination.\n\nThe furore is likely to weigh on the popularity of Lula, which has gradually slipped since he took office in January as the leftwing leader focuses more on his core base than the broad coalition that propelled him to election victory.\n\n\u201cWe need strong and independent institutions. The nomination of Zanin goes in the opposite direction,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Amo\u00eado, the former president of the rightwing Novo party.\n\nA native of S\u00e3o Paulo state, the 47-year-old Zanin represented Lula throughout the long-running Lava Jato, or Car Wash, corruption investigation, which resulted in Lula\u2019s imprisonment for more than 18 months on graft charges.\n\nHis conviction was subsequently annulled by the supreme court, which deemed that the court that judged him did not have jurisdiction. That decision paved the way for Lula to run in presidential elections last year.\n\n\u201cZanin will be a great minister of the supreme court. I know his qualities, training and competences. And I think Brazil will be proud,\u201d Lula said on Thursday.\n\nKnown officially as the Supreme Federal Court, or STF, the court is one of the country\u2019s most influential institutions and rules on thousands of cases a year, including judgments on political decisions and legislation.\n\nWhile supporters say its actions are rooted in the country\u2019s broad constitution, critics \u2014 particularly those on the right \u2014 accuse the STF of \u201cjudicial activism\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe court is going through a moment of great distrust,\u201d said Rubens Glezer, a constitutional law professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.\n\n\u201cIn this context, a nomination of someone so close [to the president], which can give the impression of an exchange of favours, continues the process of eroding the court\u2019s authority and weakening the image of the judiciary as a whole,\u201d he added.\n\nIf Zanin is confirmed, seven of the STF\u2019s 11 members will have been appointed by presidents from Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party.\n\nDespite the outrage over his nomination, Zanin\u2019s candidacy is expected to be approved following a hearing and a vote in the Senate. His nomination has also received support from other STF judges, who pointed out that various members of the court had worked in defence of politicians prior to their appointment to the tribunal.\n\nZanin could serve on the court until the age of 75, when judges are obliged to retire.

But analysts warn that cutting too soon will backfire on developing economies.\n\n\u201cIn monetary policy, [showing] resolve up front saves you more pain later,\u201d said David Hauner, head of emerging market cross-asset strategy at Bank of America Global Research. \u201cIf you let go too early, you have to go back and inflict more pain [by raising rates again].\u201d\n\nAnalysts say inflation is being entrenched by structural issues, such as a longstanding shortage of labour in central Europe and the use of indexation in Latin America, in which contracts such as rental agreements are automatically adjusted in line with higher prices. Wage inflation is high in both regions.\n\nThe fall in energy prices has helped to bring headline inflation down. In Brazil, the headline rate fall from 12 per cent last year to just over 4 per cent last month, inside the central bank\u2019s target range.\n\nBut underlying core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as energy and food, has fallen more slowly as last year\u2019s global surge in commodity prices feeds through into services and wages. Core inflation in Brazil is running at more than 7 per cent. Wages rose 13 per cent in the year to March, according to the most recent data.\n\nAs price rises become widespread, people expect inflation to stay high, exacerbating the challenges for policymakers.\n\n\u201cCentral banks are not fooled by headline rates moving down but are looking at high prints for core and services,\u201d said Alberto Ramos, Latin American economist at Goldman Sachs. \u201cThey give a better idea of how strong and intense the pressures are.\u201d\n\nDespite such pressures, some policymakers in Latin America and central Europe \u2014 many of whom were among the first to raise rates \u2014 are eager to kick-start growth. Hungary\u2019s central bank reduced its main policy rate by 1 percentage point last week to 17 per cent, despite headline inflation running at 24 per cent in April. Core inflation was higher, at almost 25 per cent. Wages rose about 17 per cent in the year to March.\n\nThierry Larose, senior portfolio manager at Vontobel, speaking before the cut, said the central bank\u2019s dovish stance was \u201cvery concerning\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is way, way too early for the central bank to think of loosening.\u201d\n\nLarose highlighted Hungary for pursuing \u201chigh-pressure\u201d fiscal policies, such as household energy price caps, aimed at \u201cboosting growth at any cost for populist reasons\u201d.\n\nIn contrast with Hungary, policymakers in Poland have stressed that interest rates will have to remain high until inflation is under control. Poland\u2019s main index of core inflation shows it to be lower than the headline rate, although an alternative index that strips out other volatile items shows it more than a point higher, at 15.3 per cent in April.\n\nEmerging market policymakers were the first to raise rates as the lifting of Covid lockdowns boosted demand and inflationary pressures. Brazil\u2019s central bank began increasing in March 2021, a full year before the first rise from the US Federal Reserve. Despite political pressure to cut, it has retained the rate of 13.75 per cent hit last August.\n\nWilliam Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said persistent high wage growth in central Europe and Latin America is \u201cone of the great unknowns\u201d for policymakers. While he expected more central banks to begin cutting this year, he said policy will be loosened \u201cmore gradually\u201d than anticipated.\n\nOver next 12 months, Hauner predicted interest rates to be reduced by less than market prices indicate in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Peru, Mexico, Colombia and Chile. In Brazil, he saw room for a bit more loosening than the roughly 2.5 percentage points of cuts that have been priced in.\n\nHe said rates would have to stay high \u201cfor a couple of years at least, to bring inflation back to where it should be\u201d.\n\nMany countries, he warned, will have to get used to rates at levels last seen before the 2008-09 financial crisis.\n\n\u201cWe are not going back to the pre-Covid paradigm [of very low interest rates] any time soon.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/595d4403-7987-4072-8768-394b61cfe767"}}, {"id": "e0d1dd2f-e776-44ab-b426-dcf09a2702da", "event_name": "S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s levels of urban misery feel higher than ever ", "blurb": "One symptom of the city\u2019s malaise is the takeover of streets and squares by addicts and drug dealers ", "date": "2023-05-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Like the faded fa\u00e7ades of its imposing 20th-century architecture, the centre of S\u00e3o Paulo is a site of drawn-out decline.

Local media is filled with reports of violence and thefts, which have spilled out into other areas. Over the past year, friends of mine have been variously pickpocketed, threatened with a blade and robbed at gunpoint.\n\nMost symbolic of the rot is Cracol\u00e2ndia \u2014 literally, \u201cCrackland\u201d \u2014 a mass of addicts who take over a street or square, where hard drugs are openly dealt and consumed within the sight of the police.

People still living here are afraid of them returning.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cracol\u00e2ndia is only the most acute symptom of a deeper malaise in Brazil\u2019s financial capital. Destitution is not uncommon in this unequal country. But the levels in S\u00e3o Paulo, a city of 12mn, have visibly worsened since I arrived at the end of 2020.\n\nWhen we moved apartments a year ago, there were a couple of tents under the flyover opposite. Now there are a dozen. By one estimate, rough sleepers in the city have rocketed above 50,000. The economic fallout from Covid-19 is blamed as a major factor.\n\nAt the St Francis Convent and Sanctuary, 700 free lunches are provided daily, up from 400 before coronavirus. \u201cIt used to be mainly single men, now there are lots of families,\u201d says Lucilene Nogueira from the charity Sefras. \u201cThis was always a crisis, but it deteriorated because of unemployment during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nAna Beatriz, her husband and their four young children were made homeless a few weeks ago after he lost his job. \u201cThere are so many people on the street. I think it\u2019s shameful\u201d she says.\n\nPublic authorities insist they are getting to grips with the issues. In a station a block away from a concentration of addicts, local police chief Jair Barbosa Ortiz decries exaggerations by \u201csensationalist media\u201d. He reckons cell phone thefts are inflated by bogus insurance claims.\n\n\u201cIn the last 20 years, the levels of violence in S\u00e3o Paulo have decreased significantly in the most important aspects \u2014 homicides and robberies,\u201d Ortiz adds.\n\nAfter months of rising thefts in the centre, the policeman points out that statistics for April actually showed a drop \u2014 which he attributes to the town hall and a new state governor putting more boots on the ground.\n\nAlexis Vargas, a high-ranking municipal official, believes that the complaints about Cracol\u00e2ndia are in fact a sign that efforts to break it up are working. Though critics argue a dispersal policy has spread the problem to various locations, he says the total number of users across them has fallen by three-quarters since 2016 to 1,000, with \u201cwholesale\u201d drug markets now gone.\u00a0He adds that referrals for specialised treatment are up and there is greater acceptance of outreach services among users.\n\nIn the long run things will improve, Vargas claims. \u201cWe are confronting a 30-year problem,\u201d he adds. \u201cSome parts of the body will get worse before healing.\u201d\n\nYet after listing all council\u2019s actions to help people off the streets and find work, even he concedes the homeless population has historically only tended to grow.\n\nFor those more fortunate, S\u00e3o Paulo as a whole remains highly liveable, vibrant and fun.

Brazil\u2019s last Workers\u2019 party-led administration ended in the impeachment of Lula\u2019s chosen successor, former president Dilma Rousseff, and the country\u2019s worst recession ever.\n\nLula, the 77-year-old former trade unionist who previously ruled the South American nation between 2003 and 2010, has attacked its central bank over high interest rates and called the institution\u2019s independence into question. Ministers also want to tweak a 2017 law that loosened Brazil\u2019s rigid employment protection rules.\n\nOliver Stuenkel, a professor at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo, said Lira was casting himself as the guardian of economic reform.\n\n\u201cHe can stop things that the president wants to do.

He was also telling the government \u2014 \u2018there\u2019s no point trying radical stuff\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker of Brazil\u2019s lower house wields considerable political power because the post controls the legislative timetable and has the authority to decide whether to proceed with impeachment requests against the head of state.\n\nLula suffered his first big legislative defeat this month when the lower house partially vetoed decrees aimed at protecting state-owned water utilities. The orders would have altered regulation approved under the previous rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, that opened the sector to more private enterprise.\n\nA crucial test of Lula\u2019s ability to pass legislation will come when lawmakers vote in the coming weeks on a set of rules designed to ease limits on state spending. Passage is critical for the leftwinger to fulfil campaign pledges of extra cash for social welfare and infrastructure.\n\nLira said the so-called new fiscal framework presented by ministers had a \u201creasonable backbone\u201d, but would need to be revised to clarify the consequences when targets for the public finances are missed.\n\nLira insisted that despite differences with Lula, his relationship was \u201ccalm, stable and harmonious\u201d, adding they would not go down \u201cthe path of confrontation\u201d.\n\nHowever, the 53-year-old congressman said an overhaul of Brazil\u2019s administrative state \u2014 regarded by economists as vital for cutting ineffective public expenditure \u2014 was unlikely in the near future.\n\n\u201cFor now, it will stay put.

There is speculation Gal\u00edpolo might be a contender.\n\nSergio Vale, economist at MB Associados, said he believed the new director would vote for a reduction in the Selic rate. \u201c[The appointment] doesn\u2019t change much in the short and medium term, but it\u2019s a sign of more important changes that we may have at the central bank in the future.\u201d\n\nRodrigo Marcatti, chief executive of Veedha Investimentos, said the choice of Gal\u00edpolo was likely to be regarded as political.\n\n\u201cAs capable and technical as he is, the market will read it as a government attempt to push towards a lower interest rate direction.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s central bank was granted formal autonomy by Congress in 2021 under the previous administration of Jair Bolsonaro, a decision that Lula has questioned.\n\nThe central bank is expected to lower rates before the end of the year. Economists nonetheless expect the Selic to be at 10 per cent by the end of 2024.\n\nThe Copom has said high rates were still necessary since inflation, while cooling, was above the bank\u2019s target. It has also cited uncertainty over the country\u2019s fiscal situation. Lula\u2019s pledge to increase public spending on welfare and infrastructure has stirred concerns about the trajectory of government debt.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Gal\u00edpolo was dispatched by Lula to act as interlocutor with the financial sector. He was previously chief executive of investment bank Banco Fator. He did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6c1f9fa7-1cf4-4d28-a6b0-4288cb6df244"}}, {"id": "a5b58846-7aef-4e06-9158-173918e18dad", "event_name": "Lula\u2019s move to scrap spending cap sparks fears of debt build-up", "blurb": "Government says push to expand the role of the state will be accompanied by commitments for balanced budgets", "date": "2023-05-0700:00:00.0", "body": "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva wants to ease constraints on government spending in Brazil, expanding the role of the state in Latin America\u2019s largest economy despite investors\u2019 concerns.\n\nBras\u00edlia is poised for a congressional vote in the coming weeks on draft legislation that will ensure real expenditure rises every year. If passed, the changes would enable the veteran leftwinger to allocate extra funds for infrastructure and welfare benefits, critical planks of the president\u2019s pledge to end hunger in the nation of 208mn.\n\nHowever, it would also mean breaking with a cap limiting budget increases to the rate of inflation. Introduced in 2017, the spending ceiling has become a pillar for the state\u2019s fiscal credibility and has helped stabilise the South American nation\u2019s level of indebtedness.\n\nMinisters say Lula will strike a balance between fulfilling campaign promises and responsible management of the public accounts by committing to a balanced budget in 2024.\n\nThey also point to the president\u2019s record during his first two terms in office between 2003 and 2010, when he rode a global commodities boom to lift tens of millions out of poverty through welfare programmes, while largely respecting economic orthodoxy.\n\nBut that has not prevented market disquiet about a possible leftward lurch towards less business-friendly policies. Worries have been compounded by the president\u2019s frequent attacks on the country\u2019s independent central bank, accusing it of denting growth by maintaining its benchmark lending rate at 13.75 per cent.\n\nOf particular concern is the impact of the extra spending on public borrowing, which is relatively high for a developing economy at 73 per cent of gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cThe new framework is unquestionably worse than the previous one when it comes to debt sustainability,\u201d wrote Marcos Casarin, chief Latin America economist at Oxford Economics.\n\nMarket reaction to the new fiscal regime has been mixed so far. The target to eliminate a budget deficit next year has provided a degree of reassurance to some money managers.\n\nJared Lou, portfolio manager at William Blair, said: \u201cWe dislike the notion that a spending ceiling is being swapped for a spending floor, but we applaud the government\u2019s intention to achieve a primary surplus in the next few years.\u201d\n\nWhile the new rules stipulate spending must grow annually by a minimum of 0.6 per cent above inflation \u2014 even when revenue collection falls \u2014 there is a maximum threshold of 2.5 per cent.\n\nUnder the proposals, annual expenditure is allowed to rise by up to 70 per cent of the preceding year\u2019s increase in government income. This drops to 50 per cent if budget targets are missed.\n\nTo balance the books, finance minister Fernando Haddad intends to raise R$150bn ($30bn) by clamping down on tax evasion, closing loopholes and imposing duties on online gambling. Officials forecast total public revenues of R$2.37trn this year.\n\nHowever, investment bank BNP Paribas said Haddad\u2019s aims of eliminating the budget deficit \u2014 not accounting for debt interest payments \u2014 next year and generating a surplus by 2025 was \u201conly achievable with tax increases and very optimistic assumptions\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen we play with the numbers we don\u2019t get a primary surplus in two years, or the debt stabilised in three,\u201d said its head of Latin America research, Gustavo Arruda. \u201cThe government is assuming much stronger growth than we believe is Brazil\u2019s potential.\u201d\n\nAlberto Ramos, head of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Latin American economics research team, said the new fiscal framework lacked teeth.\n\n\u201cThere is no trigger mechanism that automatically forces some kind of adjustment if you don\u2019t meet the targets. There\u2019s no administrative penalty or sanction.\u201d\n\nInstead, the president would have to write to Congress explaining why goals were missed and outline remedial measures.\n\nThe exemption of certain areas from the rules, such as spending on federal universities and environmental projects \u2014 along with the creation of a floor for public investments and promises of higher minimum and public sector wages \u2014 would make it difficult to keep expenditure within the permitted band, Ramos added.\n\nAnother worry is that Lula may encounter political pressure from more radical elements of his base not to restrict public spending.\n\nDesigned to restore Brazil\u2019s battered public finances to health following the economically disastrous presidency of Dilma Rousseff, Lula\u2019s handpicked successor, the 2017 cap has long faced criticism from the left that it squeezes funds for essential public services and infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the ceiling was legally bypassed to allow for Covid-19 support measures and again last year by Lula\u2019s predecessor Jair Bolsonaro to boost handouts ahead of his failed re-election bid. Lula also obtained a congressional waiver before taking office to increase the payments further.\n\nBut a deeper problem is the chronic misallocation of Brazil\u2019s state resources, experts say, along with its complex tax system.\n\nMore than 90 per cent of the country\u2019s budget consists of mandated spending, mostly on pensions and public sector salaries, which can only be changed with congressional approval.\n\nLula\u2019s task now is to guide the bill through a fickle and fragmented Congress, where his Workers\u2019 party does not command a majority.\n\nRodrigo Pacheco, president of the Senate, told a conference in London last month that he expected the fiscal framework to be approved, although with some changes that he declined to specify.\n\nLucas de Arag\u00e3o, partner at political consultancy Arko Advice, said the conservative-leaning Congress was unlikely to want big rises in spending.\n\n\u201cCongress is more conservative and right-leaning [than the president]. It has become more fiscally responsible\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009This reduces the space for adventurous spending.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Carolina Ingizza and Michael Stott\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fbc54cc6-42d6-4910-80b8-a38793f5e7e8"}}, {"id": "59f2f5d5-f51d-459a-909a-1a8827f5d2f5", "event_name": "S\u00e3o Paulo exhibitions offer a window on to a Brazil seldom seen", "blurb": "Riotously colourful works by indigenous artists feature in two shows at the city\u2019s Museum of Art", "date": "2023-05-0400:00:00.0", "body": "Otherworldly neon faces float among a profusion of shapes and curving lines on the vibrant canvas \u201cSky Bird Boa Constrictor\u201d by Acelino Huni Kuin.\u00a0The painting is a commotion of fish, multicoloured birds, leaves and scales, bordered by black-and-white zigzags. Relax your focus and the patterned body of the snake appears, winding itself through the work. The effect is both dreamlike and riotous.\n\nPsychedelic depictions of animals, plants and people are a frequent feature in Mira\u00e7\u00f5es (Visions), an exhibition of artists from the Huni Kuin indigenous peoples at the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art.\u00a0Exploring the mythologies and ancestral tales of the Amazonian tribe, many of the works are inspired by the consumption of ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic drink prepared from jungle plants and used in shamanic rituals for centuries by native South Americans. In a curator\u2019s essay, one of the artists, Ib\u00e3 Huni Kuin, describes the process of putting the exhibition together as \u201cworking in the gallery with music and myth\u201d.\n\nThe show is one of a pair that has inaugurated a year of programming dedicated to indigenous histories (or stories, depending on translation) at the cultural institute. This underscores a growing recognition of artists from Brazil\u2019s indigenous populations, who were portrayed in idealised terms by the newly independent nation\u2019s Romanticism movement in the 19th century and then studied as anthropological subjects. Their own cultural output was often not afforded the status of art, instead considered craftsmanship. Now, though, work by Brazil\u2019s original peoples is gaining space in the country\u2019s most prestigious galleries.\n\n\u201cIt is a milestone for us to celebrate,\u201d says Guilherme Giufrida, co-curator of Mira\u00e7\u00f5es. \u201cBrazil has a history of 500 years of erasure and violence against indigenous peoples, who nevertheless resist.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition brings together 108 pieces by the Huni Kuin Artists Movement, or Mahku, a collective based in the remote state of Acre which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Through tableaux that examine their spiritual relationships with nature and wildlife, as well as cosmological origins stories, we are given a lens into a culture explained on its own terms, rather than through the eyes of outsiders.\n\nMany of the art\u2019s themes are introduced in temporary murals by artists in Mahku that plaster twin staircases in the brutalist building. On one side, a simple geometric design repeats in red and yellow, with tessellating diamonds drawn on the concrete handrail. This kind of pattern is traditionally used in body decorations, basketry and pottery, and now also to frame paintings. On the other side, a procession of bow-laden hunters in tribal headdresses march in profile along the back of a giant crocodile.\n\nIn the background, audio plays of the chanting that accompanies the ayahuasca ceremony. These incantations are the main repository of traditional Huni Kuin knowledge and many of the Mahku paintings record the scenes described in them.\n\nAcross the large colourful paintings, a distinctive style emerges, eschewing realistic perspective in favour of two-dimensional figures and objects. Colours are typically bold, chromatic and intense, without shading. The works are busy, dense and bright, often containing multiple scenes or movements within the same picture. In a handful of pieces, dots inside geometric designs or the outlines of animals produce a result resembling pointillism.\n\n\u201cThey are not landscapes, still lifes or portraits like the western tradition, but they are visualisations of what is seen during specific rituals and also serve as a language,\u201d says Giufrida. \u201cThe paintings operate as a record of the stories and myths, as a kind of score for songs about the emergence of the world.\u201d\n\nWe see fish attached to boughs of trees, couples copulating, coloured bodiless faces and animals ranging from tapirs to a crab floating alongside water creatures and birds. In one piece, villagers are encircled by a boa constrictor, which occupies a central importance in Huni Kuin folklore as the revealer of the mysteries of ayahuasca.\n\nAnother element stressed is the centrality of community life through scenes of hunting, food preparation and dancing. This is reflected in Mahku\u2019s motto \u201csell art, buy land\u201d. In accordance with this credo, the collective ploughs income from art sales into improving village infrastructure, such as new housing and sanitary facilities.\n\nSaturated colours are visible too on the next floor up in The Tree of Life, an exhibition by Carm\u00e9zia Emiliano, a self-taught artist from the state of Roraima. Her oeuvre emphasises the community aspects of village life among her Macuxi people, who inhabit the border region between Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil.\n\nThe show\u2019s title refers to the myth of the Wazak\u00e1 tree, which was cut down by a playful deity for the fruits from its top. Mount Roraima, an enormous flat-topped mountain, then rose from its trunk. It figures in Emiliano\u2019s work as a metaphor for fertility or immortality.\n\nIt is more than five centuries since the Portuguese first arrived in what they would call Brazil, bringing with them oppression, murder and a marginalisation of the territory\u2019s original inhabitants that continues to this day through illegal logging and mining. These exhibitions open a window into the cultural world of peoples so often depicted or documented by others, but now through their own brushstrokes.\n\n\u2018Visions\u2019 runs to June 4, \u2018Tree of Life\u2019 to June 11, masp.org.br", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ac215a62-3eef-40d6-a72e-21ccc7b4f239"}}, {"id": "cc65b909-a7e4-435b-b20d-a5b9def2befb", "event_name": "Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s home raided by police as part of vaccine probe", "blurb": "Former Brazilian president\u2019s residence searched in investigation into alleged falsification of immunisation records", "date": "2023-05-0300:00:00.0", "body": "The home of Jair Bolsonaro was raided by police on Wednesday over allegations of faked Covid-19 vaccine records, adding to the legal woes facing Brazil\u2019s former president.\n\nOfficers served 16 search and seizure warrants along with six arrest warrants on locations in the capital Bras\u00edlia and Rio de Janeiro as part of the investigation.\n\nFederal police said people who were not immunised obtained vaccination certificates that would have allowed them to circumvent US and Brazilian health restrictions, in what they described as a \u201ccriminal association\u201d.\n\nBolsonaro, who took a dismissive attitude towards vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic and vowed not to get a jab, denied having altered records and reiterated that he was not immunised against Covid-19.\n\n\u201cMy wife was vaccinated in the US.

Emicida, real name Leandro Roque de Oliveira, appeared the acme of amicability as he rapped his verses. Foot on monitor, elbow propped on knee, he leaned towards the audience in the amiable manner of a neighbour having a natter over the garden fence, not a stone-cold killer spitting bars like bullets.\n\nThe 37-year-old is from the indie wing of Brazilian rap. His name derives from youthful skills in the rough and tumble of battle raps, slaying opponents in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s hip-hop scene with the quickness of his ad-libs. But despite that background, and the further challenge of being from one of the most unequal and violent societies in the world, his songs aren\u2019t aggressively confrontational. Instead, they seek to persuade and educate.\n\nIn the US, these exercises in consciousness-raising would be called backpack rap. Emicida admires backpack maestros De La Soul, who he believes resemble \u201ca Brazilian band singing in English\u201d. His own country\u2019s immense musical history is written into his songs too, like the tattoo on his arm of the name of Rio de Janeiro musician Pixinguinha. His latest album AmarElo aims to rescue Afro-Brazilian history from the coercive amnesia of a state that abolished slavery as late as 1888. The project includes a hit Netflix film showing Emicida performing at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s opera house in 2019, a rococo citadel for the city\u2019s European elite.\n\nAt the concrete citadel of the Barbican, playing to an audience chiefly composed of compatriots, the rapper was accompanied by Julio Fejuca on bass, Jhow Produz on drums and Michele Lemos on guitar. The show was part of the annual La Linea festival of Latin American music. An initially glitchy screen behind the musicians showed the same church stained-glass window designs as the Netflix-filmed staging. A mellow tempo predominated at first. Emicida rapped in an easy-paced, conversational fashion. Choruses had a gospelly, handclappy feel.\n\nThe pre-recorded voice of the Brazilian avatar of musical activism, Gilberto Gil, rang out during \u201c\u00c9 Tudo Pra Ontem\u201d, reciting a fable about community. For several tracks, Emicida played flute, one of Pixinguinha\u2019s signature instruments. Fejuca occasionally swapped bass for cavaquinho, a miniature guitar used in choro and samba music. Support act Drik Barbosa guested on the charmingly jazzy duet \u201c9nha\u201d.\n\nJust as the evening seemed set to dissolve into a wholesome sense of warmth, a switch was flicked with the storming rock-rap of \u201cHoje Cedo\u201d.

The bill sets out what might constitute illegal content, including crimes against \u201cthe democratic state of law, acts of terrorism, crimes of racism [and] violence against women\u201d.\n\nSilva, a lawmaker with the Communist Party of Brazil, said: \u201c[If] you disclose a fact that is known to be untrue, that causes damage, and you knowingly use robots and fake news factories, this will be considered a crime with punishments including imprisonment.\u201d\n\nThe legislation must be voted on by both houses of Congress before it can become law, a process that may take weeks.\n\nUnder pressure over censorship concerns, Silva has withdrawn a clause in the bill that would have created a government-run agency to regulate internet platforms.\n\n\u201cThe bill creates the possibility the government could abuse its power, raising legitimate concerns about accountability in situations where dissent and opposition to the government are involved,\u201d said Bruna Santos, director of the Brazil Institute at the Wilson Center, a think-tank.\n\nCritics have rounded on a clause offering immunity to elected politicians over online posts. Lawmakers defend the measure as a way to safeguard political freedoms in a country that between 1964 and 1985 was ruled by a military dictatorship. Opponents say it is a concession to far-right lawmakers, who claim they could be targeted.\n\n\u201cThe parliamentary immunity gives a privileged position to politicians, who are the main spreaders of [fake news],\u201d said Patr\u00edcia Campos Mello, author of a book on far-right misinformation in Brazil.\n\nUntil now, misinformation cases have mostly been handled on an ad hoc basis by the country\u2019s electoral court.\n\nThe plenary vote comes days after Congress voted to speed the bill\u2019s passage by skipping committee hearings. It has the backing of the government and Arthur Lira, the powerful head of the lower house, so analysts expect the legislation to pass, though potentially with major changes.\n\nAdditional reporting by Michael Pooler and Carolina Ingizza", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/827326e9-7433-4fb4-9fb5-36a76658d106"}}, {"id": "f81e40c3-5aec-46f2-b636-09ccdd694f0d", "event_name": "\u2018Public security is impossible\u2019: Lula takes on Brazil\u2019s gun owners", "blurb": "Leftwing president hopes tighter laws will reduce surge in use of firearms, including attacks on schools", "date": "2023-04-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Sheathed hunting knives and rusted hand grenades decorate the desk of Nelson de Oliveira J\u00fanior, owner of a shooting range in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s west zone. From his belt, he whips out and proudly brandishes a Brazilian-made Taurus 9mm pistol.\n\n\u201cThis government wants to take guns away from good citizens,\u201d said the former policeman as muffled shots resound from the gallery below. Like many gun enthusiasts, De Oliveira believes legal firearms are vital to keeping Brazilians safe and is critical of a clampdown by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s administration.\n\nSince returning to office for a third term in January, Lula has made tightening gun controls a key pillar of his political agenda, saying the relaxation of firearms laws by previous president Jair Bolsonaro had caused \u201cinsecurity and harm to families\u201d.\n\nBut the 77-year-old leftwing leader\u2019s strategy risks riling Brazil\u2019s powerful gun lobby as well as hundreds of thousands of hobbyists such as De Oliveira. On his first day in office, Lula signed a decree that sharply reduced the number and type of guns that private users can buy and own.\n\nWith further restrictions possible, Lula\u2019s government hopes the tougher approach will help counter a surge in attacks on schools and other institutions, and also reduce violence between criminal gangs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do public security with the number of weapons that exist today in private hands,\u201d said justice minister Fl\u00e1vio Dino.\n\nLula\u2019s administration has suspended applications for new shooting clubs and licences for recreational gun enthusiasts, such as collectors and hunters, and banned private users from carrying loaded weapons.\n\nIt has also launched a mandatory re-registration of guns owned by collectors, hunters and sports competitors bought since May 2019, when Bolsonaro signed a decree loosening several restrictions, to gauge how many are in circulation. Almost 900,000 weapons have been re-registered.\n\n\u201cYou have more armed people in Brazil than members of the military police in Brazil, so this creates a difficulty in security,\u201d Dino told the Financial Times. \u201cIt is also because part of these weapons are getting into the hands of gangs.\u201d\n\nThe clampdown has been spurred in part by alarm over a surging number of attacks on schools, both with bladed weapons and guns. Experts attribute this to the simultaneous growth in online extremism \u2014 notably far-right and misogynist \u201cincel\u201d groups \u2014 and the availability of weapons.\n\nDennis Pacheco, a researcher at the Brazilian Public Safety Forum, said the school attacks \u201chave many similarities with what happens in the US. We have young perpetrators who have mostly been to the schools where they perpetrate attacks. They organise themselves in social networks, in environments marked by hate speech.\u201d\n\nA study by S\u00e3o Paulo university in March identified 22 attacks on schools since 2002, 10 of which had occurred in the past 13 months. More than half involved firearms.\n\n\u201cIf we included the failed attempts, the figure would go up staggeringly,\u201d said Michele Prado, author of the research. Of the 36 school attacks prevented by police or other authorities in the past decade, 24 of them occurred last year, according to a recent government report.\n\nIn a sign of the heightened concern about the targeting of schools, 40 federal prosecutors this month signed an open letter, saying: \u201cIt is the result of multiple factors, including the school environment, social networks and hate speech, the cult of guns and the facilitation of access [to firearms] that was widely promoted and encouraged in the last four years.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cToday\u2019s dreadful scenario has not emerged magically.\u201d\n\nDuring his four-year term, the far-right Bolsonaro was an outspoken champion of private gun ownership for personal protection in a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest murder rates and where armed street robberies are common.\n\nAfter he loosened regulations, weapons in private collections more than doubled to nearly 3mn, according to the Sou da Paz and Igarap\u00e9 institutes. Out of a population of 208mn, the number of Brazilians authorised to own a firearm increased sevenfold to 813,000, according to army data obtained by local media.\n\nSupporters of the populist former army captain said that he could not be held responsible for the increase in school attacks, pointing out that the murder rate dropped during his government.\n\n\u201cThe [former] president was very successful in reducing violence by arming the population well,\u201d said Jorge Seif, a senator with Bolsonaro\u2019s Liberal party and member of the bala (bullet) caucus in Congress. He notes that the annual number of homicides fell to 41,000 in 2022, from a peak of 59,000 under previous incumbent Michel Temer.\n\nIt is a sentiment echoed at the shooting range in S\u00e3o Paulo. Claudio Pappone, a bearded 49-year-old electrical engineer, believes the new restrictions punish legitimate gun owners while emboldening criminals.\n\n\u201cYou can feel that security has declined [under Lula]. Criminals know that even if you have a gun, you don\u2019t have it on your belt,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, anti-violence campaigners dispute that the decline in murders can be attributed to Bolsonaro\u2019s gun policies. They cite factors including state-level security measures, a shrinking youth population and truces between organised crime factions.\n\nOpinion surveys suggest gun control measures have broad public support. A study by polling group Quaest found 75 per cent of Brazilians disagree with loosening regulations on purchasing or owning arms.\n\nActivists and researchers said Lula\u2019s administration was already proving adept at monitoring and diagnosing the underlying reasons for gun violence, particularly involving incidents linked to rightwing or online extremism, but more needed to be done to tackle its root causes.\n\n\u201cEven if we manage to slow down the entry of new weapons into the country, reducing those already in circulation is quite a challenge,\u201d said Pacheco, adding that many weapons acquired legally are likely to be sold on illegally. \u201cWe have a difficult road ahead of us,\u201d he added.", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5c73e5ed-c305-4ea1-bfe3-36aee4b66aad"}}, {"id": "6538045c-6497-40bd-89c4-607c287046d4", "event_name": "Brazil launches parliamentary probe into January 8 riot", "blurb": "Inquiry into \u2018coup attempt\u2019 sets stage for battle between president Lula and rightwing lawmakers", "date": "2023-04-2600:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s Congress is launching an official investigation into the January 8 storming of the nation\u2019s political and judicial institutions, setting the stage for an acrimonious public battle between President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and the rightwing opposition.\n\nThe launch of the parliamentary inquiry comes amid criminal investigations into the riots, in which thousands of supporters of rightwing former president Jair Bolsonaro stormed and ransacked the country\u2019s parliament, supreme court and presidential palace in Bras\u00edlia, claiming his election defeat in October was rigged and calling for a military intervention.\n\n\u201cThe inquiry will find out who is responsible for the acts [on January 8] and who are the main intellectual authors. It seems obvious to me that the main one is Bolsonaro,\u201d said Rog\u00e9rio Correia, a lawmaker with the governing Workers\u2019 party, which has called the insurrection a \u201ccoup attempt\u201d. Bolsonaro has denied any involvement.\n\nBefore the hearing begins, a commission made up of senators and lower-house lawmakers will be chosen to run the inquiry. The investigation is likely to continue for months and feature dozens of witnesses from across the political spectrum.\n\nAt its conclusion, the inquiry\u2019s rapporteur may recommend charges, which state prosecutors would then evaluate. While politicians have framed the inquiry as a reckoning for an event that shook the country\u2019s political establishment, many view it as a platform for grandstanding and mudslinging.\n\nBeyond the parliamentary investigation, the supreme court is poised to launch cases against hundreds of alleged rioters. Bolsonaro was questioned by federal police this week.\n\nLula had long sought to prevent the inquiry, believing it would give a platform to opposition politicians to attack his leftwing administration, which took office a week before the riots in January. The probe could also distract from his political agenda, analysts said.\n\nHis stance, however, became untenable after video footage released last week showed one of his cabinet members \u2014 the head of the office of institutional security \u2014 in the presidential palace on January 8 as it was being raided. The minister, who in the video appeared unperturbed by the attacks, has since resigned.\n\n\u201cThe reopening of this debate will oblige the government to allocate resources and political capital,\u201d said Adriano Laureno at political consultancy Prospectiva, adding that the inquiry would probably slow down the passage of important reforms such as an overhaul of the tax system.\n\n\u201cOn the government side, there is little to gain. On the opposition side, there is an opportunity to wear down the government and to keep its radical base mobilised on social media.\u201d\n\nAlthough some leftwing lawmakers support the inquiry, its creation was driven by far-right parties that want to recast the insurrection as a false flag operation secretly orchestrated by Lula. They have also accused the government of negligence.\n\n\u201cCountless times I visited the prisons where the supposed terrorists were detained. I saw elderly, autistic, homeless and people with serious health problems. Are these really the people responsible for vandalism? There are hidden issues that we need to investigate,\u201d said Magno Malta, a senator and ally of Bolsonaro.\n\nThe 77-year-old Lula took office on sweeping promises that he would kick-start the economy, eradicate hunger and make big investments in infrastructure and social welfare.\n\nBut his popularity has gradually slipped, and he has become embroiled in a noisy spat with the central bank, which he accuses of keeping interest rates artificially high to the detriment of poorer Brazilians.\n\nInternationally, Lula has caused consternation in the US and Europe when he this month claimed Ukraine was partly responsible for the war there and that western nations were \u201ccontributing\u201d to the conflict.\n\nA poll from Ipec this month found that the government had a 39 per cent approval rating, down from 41 per cent last month.\n\nAdditional reporting by Carolina Ingizza\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/44bcde46-f963-409d-b7b4-27fc7dbc6365"}}, {"id": "771bcb21-6756-4996-89f0-dcf74d810228", "event_name": "Lula\u2019s stance on Ukraine war mars his Iberian trip", "blurb": "Brazilian president\u2019s intransigence highlights EU\u2019s difficulty convincing global south to hold Russia accountable", "date": "2023-04-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Brazil\u2019s president is touring the Iberian peninsula in an attempt to boost ties with the EU, but his persistent claims that both Russia and Ukraine are responsible for the ongoing war highlight the bloc\u2019s difficulty in winning over the global south.\n\nDuring his stay in Portugal, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said that Ukraine \u201cdoes not want to stop\u201d the war and insisted peace talks should begin, even though Moscow continues its missile attacks on civilian targets and Russian troops are still occupying parts of Ukraine.\n\nLula\u2019s rhetoric on the war, which the US earlier condemned as \u201cparroting Russian and Chinese propaganda\u201d, has underscored the challenge facing the EU and its allies as it struggles to build a global coalition seeking to hold Russia accountable for its invasion of Ukraine, and exposed its lack of political influence over swaths of the non-western world.\n\nWhile Lula made clear that he condemned the invasion of a sovereign state, he did not disavow comments made last week in the United Arab Emirates that Russia and Ukraine bore joint responsibility and that the US and EU were \u201ccontributing\u201d to the conflict.\n\n\u201cWe are not in favour of war. We want peace,\u201d Lula said in Lisbon on Saturday alongside Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Portugal\u2019s president. In the case of the ongoing conflict, Lula added: \u201cRussia does not want to stop and Ukraine does not want to stop. And if you don\u2019t talk about peace, you are contributing to war.\u201d\n\nHe is due to travel on to Spain on Tuesday, a country that will take over the rotating EU presidency in July. This is Lula\u2019s first European trip since taking office in January and comes on the heels of visits to China and the US. A\u00a0senior diplomat said that Lula\u2019s trip to the Iberian peninsula was about demonstrating that the EU was a \u201ckey priority\u201d for Latin America\u2019s largest country.\n\nThe global response to the war in Ukraine has provided a startling wake-up call to EU diplomats who have failed to convince major nations in Latin America, Africa and south-east Asia to oppose Moscow\u2019s invasion.\n\nEU officials have admitted that they have struggled to challenge Russian and Chinese rhetoric across the developing world, which portrays the invasion of Ukraine as an act of self-defence by Russia and claims unjustified western sanctions have exacerbated global inflation, food supply concerns and geopolitical instability.\n\nWhile Brazil has voted in the UN to condemn the violation of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and Russia\u2019s sham annexation of parts of its territory, it has not joined western sanctions against Moscow or agreed to supply arms to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI understand Europe\u2019s position, I understand the position of Romania, which has a 600km border with Ukraine, but I want people to understand Brazil\u2019s position,\u201d Lula told reporters in Lisbon. \u201cBrazil does not want to participate in the war, Brazil wants to find a group of people who are willing to spend a little time talking with all the people who are willing to make peace.\u201d\n\nEU officials have privately sought to downplay the significance of Lula\u2019s remarks that both Russia and Ukraine bear responsibility for the conflict, pointing out that experienced politicians such as the 77-year-old will always adapt their rhetoric to their audience to seek geopolitical advantages.\n\nBut they have added to the sense of disconnect ahead of a summit of EU, Latin American and Caribbean countries in Brussels this July, where the 27-member bloc is seeking to reverse years of lacklustre engagement with the region.\n\nThe EU has not held a summit with the region for eight years, something that a senior Brussels official said had been a mistake.\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons that could explain that anomaly, but one of them is obviously the fact that it was perceived that it wasn\u2019t sufficiently important,\u201d the official admitted.\n\n\u201cWe have not been able to communicate effectively to what extent our commitment to the region was solid,\u201d they added. \u201cNow this is going to change from an institutional point of view.\u201d\n\nEU-Brazilian relations are rocky after a row over environmental rules last month held up a trade agreement with four of South America\u2019s largest economies. \u201cQuite a large number\u201d of Latin American and Caribbean nations \u201cfeel a bit abandoned by Europe in recent years,\u201d said a second EU official. \u201cWe need to fix that.\u201d\n\nFrancisco Seixas da Costa, a former Portuguese deputy foreign minister and ambassador to Brazil, said that Lula\u2019s pronouncements on Ukraine were consistent with his country\u2019s longstanding desire \u201cto be seen as an actor on the international stage, as an actor of the global south\u201d. Brazil traditionally maintains a policy of neutrality, which in this case was becoming problematic, he said.\u201cHe didn\u2019t realise it was impossible to maintain the idea of being neutral. Being neutral means not being on the side of the victim,\u201d Seixas da Costa said. \u201cThat is a mistake.\u201d\n\nDuring the press conference in Lisbon marked by its friendly tone and references to Brazil and Portugal, its former colonial power, as \u201cbrotherly nations\u201d, de Sousa stressed that Brazil had always voted on Ukraine\u2019s side at the UN since the war began, but recognised that \u201cthe Portuguese position is different from Brazil\u2019s\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe war should never have started. Russia should not have invaded. But the fact is it happened,\u201d Lula added. \u201cInstead of now choosing a side, I want to choose a third way, which is peace building.\u201d", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/14eb70f0-201b-41c6-af16-2c427b12acc2"}}, {"id": "32c503ec-9880-4a93-860a-a10beb24bee3", "event_name": "The west has too little to offer leaders like Lula", "blurb": "Chinese trade and investment in Brazil exerts a pull on the country\u2019s geopolitical alignment", "date": "2023-04-2000:00:00.0", "body": "French president Emmanuel Macron, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and then last week Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva: the visitor\u2019s book for Xi Jinping\u2019s administration has been filling up fast of late.\n\nLula found common ground with Xi over global governance: reducing the dollar\u2019s dominance, shifting geoeconomic power towards groups such as the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and criticising the US for encouraging war in Ukraine.\n\nIn practice, these grandiose ideas are heavily oversold. They do not mean Brazil has joined a Chinese geopolitical camp and abandoned the US and the EU. More concerning for Washington and Brussels should be that China is offering immediate help for Lula\u2019s priority of reindustrialising Brazil, which may challenge the rich economies\u2019 traditional role in investment and trade.\n\nThe geoeconomic framing of the Xi-Lula approach looks pretty flimsy on close examination, particularly the role of the Brics. Rivalries between members of the group, notably India and China, have rendered it largely ceremonial. The original inventor of the Brics categorisation, former Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O\u2019Neill, points out that the renminbi, the only vaguely credible Brics challenger to the dollar\u2019s global role, will not do so as long as China maintains capital controls.\n\nBrazil has reduced its exposure to dollar markets since its exchange rate and debt crises in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and its government now borrows almost exclusively in local currency. But, as an exporter of dollar-denominated commodities, its companies will be exposed to exchange rate volatility if it shifts to another global currency.\n\nChina\u2019s practical potential as a trade and investment partner looks more substantive. Lula wants an activist trade and industrial policy \u2014 rather similar to Joe Biden\u2019s in the US \u2014 to reverse the trend of hollowing out Brazilian manufacturing, which has fallen to just 10 per cent of gross domestic product, and to make Brazil a diversification option for global value networks.\n\nChinese official lending to Latin America has dropped off since 2016, but its companies are still keen on direct investment there: the Brazil-China Business Council estimates Brazil was the single largest recipient of Chinese FDI in 2021. Chinese auto companies such as BYD and Great Wall Motors have invested heavily in electric vehicle production in Brazil. A relationship based on Chinese manufacturing FDI would be a big change from the uneasy trading pattern of the 2000s and 2010s, sometimes labelled \u201ccolonial\u201d, where Brazil exported commodities but undercut its domestic industry by importing Chinese goods.\n\nThe US and Europe have traditionally been by far the biggest sources of FDI into Brazil, but Biden\u2019s policy in the US in particular is in favour of reshoring, or trading with a small number of trusted trading partners, rather than producing overseas. While GM has a big presence in Brazil, for example, Ford shut down all car production there in 2021 and is concentrating on producing electric vehicles in the US.\n\nThe US\u2019s aversion to signing any new trade deals will handicap Brazil\u2019s attempts to mesh with supply networks aimed at the American market \u2014 certainly compared with a country like Mexico, which has privileged access through the US-Mexico-Canada trade pact.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU\u2019s trade deal with the Brazil-dominated Mercosur bloc, agreed in principle in 2019, is still awaiting ratification. The latest obstacle is Brussels, under pressure from vocal environmental and farming lobbies, insisting that Brazil first sign a side letter emphasising its commitments to reducing deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nEven if that letter is agreed, Brazilian access to the EU market might be hindered by a new EU deforestation regulation banning products, including beef and soya, raised on recently-cleared land. Critics of the EU say it frequently undermines new market access by imposing technical barriers. Tatiana Prazeres, Brazil\u2019s foreign trade secretary, told the FT: \u201cYou cannot have a situation where you reduce your tariffs in the expectation of real market access and then suddenly you have new barriers in the way. The conversations we are having with the EU are very frank.\u201d\n\nEven if the EU-Mercosur agreement is ratified, it isn\u2019t necessarily the solution Brazil is looking for. Nicknamed the \u201ccars for beef\u201d deal, reductions in auto tariffs in the EU-Mercosur agreement will incentivise European carmakers to export into the Brazilian market more than directly encouraging them to produce there. The deal also places restrictions on Brazil\u2019s ability to use public procurement to favour domestic industry. Lula is asking the EU for his own side letter to clarify what leeway Brazil is permitted.\n\nDethroning the dollar might have made the headlines from the Lula-Xi meeting. But China\u2019s geopolitical rivals in Washington and Brussels \u2014 and Paris \u2014 should be more concerned about the direct help Brazil is being offered by Chinese companies. Many emerging markets are in similar positions to Brazil, and their allegiances will be determined as much or more by investment and jobs than global currencies and the Ukraine war.\n\nalan.beattie@ft.com\n\n", "region_codes": ["BR"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0a668661-8938-4d11-8a38-d963b16a5f1b"}}]
