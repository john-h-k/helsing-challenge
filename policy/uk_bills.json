Stakeholders should prepare for potential regulatory changes affecting animal importation practices.",
    "body": "OFFICIAL – SENSITIVE  \n1 \n  \nANIMAL WELFARE (IMPORT OF DOGS, CATS AND FERRETS) BILL  \n \nMemorandum from the  Department  for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  \nto the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee  \n \nA. INTRODUCTION  \n \n1. This memorandum has been prepared for the Delegated Powers and Regulatory \nReform  Committee to assist with its scrutiny of the  Animal Welfare  (Import of Dogs, \nCats and Ferrets ) Bill (“the Bill”). The Bill was introduced in the House of \nCommons  on 16th October 2024 and is schedule d for second read ing on 29 \nNovember 2024 . This memorandum identifies the  provisions of the Bill that confer \npowers to make delegated legislation. It explains in  each case why the power has \nbeen taken and explain s the nature of, and the reason for, the procedure selected.  \n \nB.  PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE BILL  \n \n2. The Bill aims to address the issues of illegal puppy smuggling and the increasing \nvolume of low -welfare movement of pet animals into the United Kingdom from \nthird countries. These movements raise serious welfare issues, as evidence \nsuggests that many imported puppies and kittens are being sourced from facilities \nwith low welfare standards, with concerns about the way in which the animals \nhave been kept and treated and the conditions in which they have been \ntransported, which leads to poor health and welfare outcomes.  \n \n3. The Bill aims to improve the welfare of imported dogs, cats and ferrets through : \n \n(1) making amendments to the pet travel scheme rules to prevent \ncommercial imports being disguised  as non -commercial movements , \nspecifically : \n \na) reducing the number of dogs , cats  and ferrets that can travel under \nthe non -commercial rules from five per person to five per vehicle, or \nthree per foot or air passenger ; and \nb) ensuring that when a non -commercial movement of a dog, cat or \nferret is carried out by an authorised person, it may only take place \nwithin five days of the movement of the owner ; and    \n(2) introduc ing enabling powers to allow an appropriate national authority, \nfor the purpose of promoting the welfare of dogs, cats and ferrets, to \nmake regulations about the bringing of any of those animals into the \nUnited Kingdom  and related matters . \n  \nOFFICIAL – SENSITIVE  \n2 \n C. DELEGATED POWERS  \n \nClause  1: Regulations about bringing  dogs, cats and ferrets into the United \nKingdom  \n \n(1) Power to make provision in relation to b ringing dogs, cats and ferrets into the \nUnited Kingdom  for the purpose of animal welfare  \n \nPower conferred  on: the appropriate national authority  \n \nPower exercised by : regulations  \n \nParliamentary Procedure : affirmative  procedure  or, where the regulations only \ncontain provision on fees in relation to perm it applications, negative procedure . \n \n(6) Power to make provision about dogs, cats or ferrets that are seized or detained  \nPower conferred on : the appropriate national authority  \n \nPower exercised by : regulations  \n \nParliamentary Procedure : affirmative procedure  \n \n \n(8) Power to impose monetary penalties  \n \nPower conferred on : the appropriate national authority  \n \nPower exercised by : regulations  \n \nParliamentary Procedure : affirmative procedure  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n4. This Clause will allow the appropriate national authority , which is defined in Clause \n3(1) as the Secretary of State  or provided they have legislative competence, the \nScottish Ministers, the Welsh Ministers or the Department of Agriculture \nEnvironment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland (DAERA), to introduce \nregulations prohibiting or  restricting imports of dogs, cats or ferrets on welfare \ngrounds . DAERA may , however,  need to obtain the Secretary of State’s consent \nbefore exe rcising this power  depending on the content of the proposed regulations.  \n5. Pursuant to subsection (2), this Clause will also enable the appropriate national \nauthority to make provision about enforcement (which as set out in Clause 2( 1) \nmay include provision conferring functions or powers of entry, inspection, search, \nseizure or detention, provision about the keeping of records or the revocations of \nlicences or approvals or the creation of criminal offences); and to introduce \nOFFICIAL – SENSITIVE  \n3 \n exemptions to any prohibitions  or restrictions , including a permitting scheme.  \n6. Pursuant to subsection s (3) and (4) , in respect of England , Wales and Scotland, \nthe first time the power is exercised in relation to dogs or cats, the regulations \nmust contain provision prohibiting the bringing into the relevant part of the United \nKingdom  of a dog or cat (as applicable) belonging to any of the following \ncategories : \n(1) a dog or cat that is below six months of age;  \n(2) a dog or cat that is more than 42 days’ pregnant; and \n(3) a dog or cat that has been mutilated (i.e., a dog with cropped ears or a \ndocked tail or a declawed cat).  \n7. Pursuant to subsections ( 6) and ( 7), the appropriate national authority may make \nprovision about dogs, cats or ferrets that are seized or detained for contravention \nof any animal welfare or health legislation that relates to the bringing of dogs, cats \nor ferrets into the United Kingdom , including in relation to meeting the costs of \ndetention and transferring ownership of such animals . \n8. Pursuant to subsection ( 8), the appropriate national authority may  impos e \nmonetary penalties for contravention of any animal welfare or health legislation \nthat relates to the bringing of dogs, cats or ferrets into the United Kingdom . \n \nJustification for taking the power s \n \n9. The power s will ensure that the Department, the Welsh Ministers and the Scottish \nMinisters are able to act to prohibit the current main focus of our concerns, i.e. \nimport s of young puppies and kittens , which , as well as raising welfare concerns, \noften do not comply with the current animal health rules, heavily pregnant dogs \nand cats , and those that have been mutilated.  \n \n10. The powers will also enable the appropriate national authority to tackle low -\nwelfare imports of dogs, cats and ferrets through a range of enforcement tools \nand to tackle these imports dynamically. They will enable the appropriate national \nauthority to address existing issues, for example , around how to proceed with an \nanimal which has been seized and /or detained by the authorities for non -\ncompliance with relevant animal health and welfare rules, and subsequently \nabandoned , but they will also provide the mea ns to act in the future to close down \nemerging low -welfare practices, including attempts to circumvent restrictions. For \nexample, t he powers will allow for the introduction of similar measures for ferrets \nin the future if low -welfare trade in this species escalates or evidence of welfare \nconcerns is produced by stakeholders and regulators.  Illicit trade is quick to react \nto legislative and enforcement changes and so this ability to make future changes \nwill be important to ensure that the policy aims are met.  Appropriate safeguards \nare included in relation to the powers of entry that may be conferred on \nenforcement authorities and the criminal offences that may be created.  \n \nOFFICIAL – SENSITIVE  \n4 \n 11. The regulations setting out the prohibitions, exemptions, enforcement provisions , \noffences  and penalties made under the enabling power s will be complex and \ntechnical . The existing legislative regime governing the non -commercial \nmovement and commercial import of dogs, cats and ferrets , and enforcement \nagainst non -compliance,  is complicated and involves the interaction of a  number \nof pieces of distinct but interlinked assimilated direct and domestic legislation.  \n \n12. The Department believes that i ntroducing these measures in secondary \nlegislation will be more suitable to the ir complexity, as well as  provid ing sufficient \ntime to engage with Devolved Governments  and enforcement bodies to ensure \nthat regulations are robust, comprehensive and can be implement ed effectively.   \n \n13. Using power s, rather than including provisions on the face of the Bill, will also \nenable the U nited Kingdom  to meet its World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) \nobligations. The Department anticipates that the prohibitio ns that will be \nintroduced under this power to address the kind of low -welfare imports currently \nentering the United Kingdom  may amount to technical regulations for the purposes \nof the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. Where a WTO member is \nproposing to adopt technical regulations, which may have a significant effect on \ntrade, it is obliged to consult other WTO members on the proposed technical \nregulations. The power will allow for appropriate consultation  with other WTO \nmembers to take place before any suc h technical regulations are adopted.  \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n14. The Department has considered the scope of the power s carefully and has \nbalanced the need to be dynamic, and to be able to address new concerns \nregarding low -welfare imports quickly, against the need for Parliamentary \noversight.  \n \n15. Any measures delivered via the delegated power s will be made by Statutory \nInstrument subject to the draft affirmative procedure , except where the regulations \nonly contain provision on the fees payable in relation to applications for permits . \nWe consider the affirmative procedure to apply the appropriate level of scrutiny in \nits assessment of these measures, its impacts, and any evidence supplied, which \nmust be actively approved in both Houses of Parliament.  We consider that the \nnegative procedure is appropr iate for regulations which set fees, which will need \nto be set to recover the costs incurred in determining applications for permits and \nwill need to b e adjusted to reflect those costs from time to time.  \n \nClause 2: Regulations under section 1: supplementary  \n \n(1)(h) Power to amend primary legislation  \n \nPower conferred on:  the appropriate national authority  \n \nPower exercised by:  regulations  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:  affirmative procedure  \n \nOFFICIAL – SENSITIVE  \n5 \n  \nContext and Purpose  \n \n16. This Clause provides that regulations  made under Clause 1 may amend , repeal \nor revoke primary legislation.  \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n17. This power may only be exercised in connection with exercising the powers in \nClaus e 1 of the Bill. It is not possible to establish in advance all supplementary, \nincidental and consequential provision that may be required, and these may \ninclude a future requirement to make consequential amendments to primary \nlegislation , e.g. to create or amend offences and increase penalties, which may \ninclude imprisonment, and create powers of entry; or to  make further amendments \nto those provisions of the  pet travel scheme rules  that are  being amended by the \nBill such as the maximum number of pets permitted to enter Great Britain non -\ncommercially in a vehicle . A power is needed to bring certainty to the statute book \nwhere a provision of the Bill might otherwise give rise to any legal uncertainty or \nlegal lacunas after the Bill comes into force.   \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n  \n18. The Department believes that, on balance, the increased parliamentary scrutiny \nof the affirmative procedure is appropriate and is consistent with the level of \nparliamentary scrutiny required of regulations to promote welfare under the Animal \nWelfare Act 2006 , the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006  and the \nWelfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 .  \n \nClause 6: Consequential provision  \n \n(3) Power to make consequential provision  \n \nPower conferred on:  the Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:  regulations  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:  negative procedure  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n19. This Clause gives a power to the Secretary of State to make regulations to make \nany provision which  is consequential on the provision made by Clause s 4 or 5 , \nwhich make  changes to the rules governing the non -commercial movement of pet \nanimals .  \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n20. This power may only be exercised in connection with Clauses 4 or 5 ; it is not to \nbe used in isolation to make unwarranted supplementary, incidental or \nconsequential provisions. Given that the existing legislative regime governing the \nOFFICIAL – SENSITIVE  \n6 \n non-commercial movement and commercial import of dogs, cats and ferrets, and \nenforcement against non -compliance, is complicated and involves the interaction \nof a number of pieces of distinct but interlinked assimilated direct and domestic \nlegislation,  it is not possible to establish in advance all supplementary, incidental \nand consequential provisions that may be required. A power is needed to bring \ncertainty to the statute book where a provision of the Bill might otherwise give rise \nany legal uncertaint y or legal lacunas after the Bill comes into force.  \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n21. The changes to legislation are likely to be technical matters for which the negative \nresolution procedure is appropriate ( e.g., making consequential amendments to \nexisting secondary legislation).  \n \nClause 7: Regulations  \n \n(1) Power to make consequential provision etc  \n \nPower conferred on:  the appropriate national authority  \n \nPower exercised by:  regulations  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:  affirmative procedure  or, where the regulations only \ncontain provision on fees in relation to permit applications, negative procedure  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n22. This Clause provides that regulations made under the Bill may make \nconsequential, transitional or saving provisions and make different provision for \ndifferent purposes or different areas.  \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n23. Given that the existing legislative regime governing the non -commercial \nmovement and commercial import of dogs, cats and ferrets, and enforcement \nagainst non -compliance, is complicated and involves the interaction of a number \nof pieces of distinct but inte rlinked assimilated direct and domestic legislation, i t is \nnot possible to establish in advance all supplementary, incidental and \nconsequential provisions that may be required. A power is needed to bring \ncertainty to the statute book where a provision of t he Bill might otherwise give rise \nto any legal uncertainty or legal lacunas after the Bill comes into force.  \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n  \n24. The Department believes that, on balance, the increased parliamentary scrutiny \nof the affirmative procedure is appropriate and is consistent with the level of \nparliamentary scrutiny required of regulations to promote welfare under the Animal \nWelfare Act 2006, the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and the \nWelfare of Animals Act (Northern Ire land) 2011.  \nOFFICIAL – SENSITIVE  \n7 \n  \n \nClause 8: Extent, commencement and short title  \n \n(3) Power to make regulations to commence Clauses 1 to 7 ; \n \nPower conferred on:  the Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:  regulations  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:  no procedure  \n \n \n(5) Power to make transitional provision ; \n \nPower conferred on:  the Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:  regulations  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:  no procedure  \n \n \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n25. Sub-section (3) provides that Clauses 1 to 7 come into force on such day as the \nSecretary of State may by regulations appoint.   Pursuant to sub -section (6), this \nincludes the power to make different provision for different purposes . \n \n26. Sub-section (5) provides that t he Secretary of State may by regulations make such \ntransitional or saving provision as the Secretary of State considers appropriate in \nconnection with the coming into force of any provision of the Bill.  \n \nJustification for taking the power s \n27. It is appropriate to provide for commencement of the provisions of the Bill by \nregulations and to include transitional provision in relation to their commencement  \nto allow for the provisions to be brought into force at an appropriate time . \nCommencement of provisions of a Bill by way of regulations is standard pr actice.   \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n28. Consistent with common practice in relation to commencement regulations and \nassociated transitional provision, regulations made under this clause are not \nsubject to any Parliamentary procedure. Parliament has approved the principle of \nthe provisions to be commenced by enacting them; commencement by \nregulations enables the provisions to be brought into force at the appropriate time \nand in an orderly manner  \n \nOFFICIAL – SENSITIVE  \n8",

 to \nend their  own  life; and for connected  purposes. \nB E IT ENACTED by the King’s  most  Excellent  Majesty,  by and with  the advice  and \nconsent  of the Lords  Spiritual  and Temporal,  and Commons,  in this present \nParliament  assembled,  and by the authority  of the same,  as follows:— \n1 Assisted  dying \n(1) Subject  to the consent  of the High  Court  (Family  Division)  pursuant  to \nsubsection  (2), a person  who  is terminally  ill may  request  and lawfully  be \nprovided  with  assistance  to end their  own  life. \n5 (2) Subsection  (1) applies  only  if the High  Court  (Family  Division),  by order, \nconfirms  that it is satisfied  that the person— \n(a) has a voluntary,  clear,  settled  and informed  wish  to end their  own \nlife, \n(b) has made  a declaration  to that effect  in accordance  with  section  3, and \n10 (c) on the day the declaration  is made— \n(i) is aged  18 or over, \n(ii) has capacity  to make  the decision  to end their  own  life, and \n(iii) has been  ordinarily  resident  in England  and Wales  for not less \nthan  one year. \n15 2 Terminal  illness \n(1) For the purposes  of this Act, a person  is terminally  ill if that person— \n(a) has been  diagnosed  by a registered  medical  practitioner  as having  an \ninevitably  progressive  condition  which  cannot  be reversed  by treatment \n(“a terminal  illness”),  and \n20 (b) as a consequence  of that terminal  illness,  is reasonably  expected  to \ndie within  six months. \n(2) Treatment  which  only  relieves  the symptoms  of an inevitably  progressive \ncondition  temporarily  is not to be regarded  as treatment  which  can reverse \nthat condition. \n25 (3) A person  is not considered  to be terminally  ill solely  by reason  of— \n59/1 HL Bill 7 1 Assisted  Dying  for Terminally  Ill Adults  Bill [HL] \n(a) being  diagnosed  with  a mental  illness,  within  the meaning  of the \nMental  Health  Act 1983,  or \n(b) having  a disability,  within  the meaning  of section  6 of the Equality \nAct 2010; \n5 unless  the person  is also considered  to be terminally  ill as defined  in subsection \n2(1). \n3 Declaration \n(1) An application  may  be made  to the High  Court  (Family  Division)  under \nsection  1(1) only  if— \n10 (a) the person  has made  and signed  a declaration  that they  have  a \nvoluntary,  clear,  settled  and informed  wish  to end their  life in the \nform  in the Schedule  in the presence  of a witness  (who  must  not be \na relative  or directly  involved  in the person’s  care or treatment  or \n15likely  to receive  any benefit  directly  or indirectly  from  the person’s \ndeath)  who  signed  the declaration  in the person’s  presence,  and \n(b) that declaration  has been  countersigned  in accordance  with  subsection \n(4) by— \n(i) a suitably  qualified  registered  medical  practitioner  from  whom \n20the person  has requested  assistance  to end their  life (“the \nattending  doctor”);  and \n(ii) another  suitably  qualified  registered  medical  practitioner  (“the \nindependent  doctor”)  who  is not a relative,  partner  or colleague \nin the same  practice  or clinical  team,  of the attending  doctor; \n25neither  of whom  may  also be the witness  required  under  paragraph \n(a). \n(2) The attending  doctor  (but not the independent  doctor)  may  be, but need  not \nbe, the registered  medical  practitioner  who  diagnosed  that the person  is \nterminally  ill or first informed  the person  of that diagnosis. \n(3) The attending  doctor  or the independent  doctor— \n30 (a) may  not be a relative  or partner  of, nor have  any personal  relationship \nwith,  the person  making  the request, \n(b) may  not expect  to receive  any benefit,  whether  directly  or indirectly, \nfrom  the death  of the person  making  the declaration,  and \n(c) \n35must  be able to communicate  with  the person  making  the declaration \nin the language  of that person’s  choice,  if necessary  via an interpreter \nwho  is not a relative  of the person. \n(4) Before  countersigning  a person’s  declaration,  the attending  doctor  and the \nindependent  doctor,  having  separately  examined  the person  and the person’s \n40medical  records  and each  acting  independently  of the other,  must  be satisfied \nthat the person— \n(a) is terminally  ill, \n(b) has the capacity  to make  the decision  to end their  own  life, and Assisted  Dying  for Terminally  Ill Adults  Bill [HL] 2 \n(c) has a clear  and settled  intention  to end their  own  life which  has been \nreached  voluntarily,  on an informed  basis  and without  undue  influence, \ncoercion  or duress. \n(5) \n5For the purposes  of subsection  (4)(c), the attending  doctor  and independent \ndoctor  can regard  the person  as having  a clear  and settled  intention  to end \ntheir  own  life if they  are satisfied,  on the basis  of in-depth  discussions  with \nthe person,  that the person  is acting  on their  own  free will,  without  undue \ninfluence,  coercion  or duress. \n(6) \n10In deciding  whether  to countersign  a declaration  under  subsection  (4), the \nattending  doctor  and the independent  doctor  must  be satisfied  that the person \nmaking  it has been  fully  informed  of the palliative,  hospice  and other  care \nwhich  is available  to that person. \n(7) If the attending  doctor  or independent  doctor  has doubt  as to a person’s \n15capacity  to make  a decision  under  subsection  (4)(b), before  deciding  whether \nto countersign  a declaration  made  by that person  the doctor  must— \n(a) refer  the person  for assessment  by an appropriate  specialist,  and \n(b) take account  of any opinion  provided  by the appropriate  specialist  in \nrespect  of that person. \n(8) \n20A declaration  under  this section  is valid  and takes  effect  on such  date  as the \nHigh  Court  (Family  Division)  may  order. \n(9) A person  who  has made  a declaration  under  this section  may  revoke  it at \nany time  and revocation  need  not be in writing. \n(10) For the purpose  of subsection  (1)(b)(ii), an attending  or independent  doctor \n25is suitably  qualified  if that doctor  holds  such  qualification  or has such \nexperience,  including  in respect  of the diagnosis  and management  of terminal \nillness,  as the Secretary  of State  may  specify  in regulations  (which  may  make \ndifferent  provision  for different  purposes). \n(11) In this section , “appropriate  specialist”  means  a registered  practitioner  (other \n30than  the attending  doctor  or independent  doctor)  who  is registered  in the \nspecialty  of psychiatry  in the Special  Register  kept  by the General  Medical \nCouncil. \n4 Assistance  in dying \n(1) The attending  doctor  of a person  who  has made  a valid  declaration  and \n35obtained  the consent  of the High  Court  may  prescribe  medicines  for that \nperson  to enable  that person  to end their  own  life. \n(2) Any  medicines  prescribed  under  subsection  (1) may  only  be delivered  to the \nperson  for whom  they  are prescribed— \n(a) by the attending  doctor,  or \n(b) by— \n40 (i) another  registered  medical  practitioner,  or \n(ii) a registered  nurse \nwho  has been  authorised  to do so by the attending  doctor, 3 Assisted  Dying  for Terminally  Ill Adults  Bill [HL] \n(c) after  the assisting  health  professional  has confirmed  that the person \nhas not revoked  and does  not wish  to revoke  their  declaration,  and \n(d) after  a period  of not less than  14 days  has elapsed  since  the day on \nwhich  consent  under  section  1 is given  by the High  Court. \n5 (3) If the attending  doctor  and the independent  doctor  agree  that a person’s \ndeath  from  terminal  illness  is reasonably  expected  to occur  within  one month \nof the day on which  consent  under  section  1 is given  by the High  Court,  the \nperiod  specified  in subsection  (2)(d) is reduced  to six days. \n(4) \n10In respect  of a medicine  which  has been  prescribed  for a person  under \nsubsection  (1), an assisting  health  professional  may— \n(a) prepare  that medicine  for self-administration  by that person, \n(b) prepare  a medical  device  which  will enable  that person  to \nself-administer  the medicine,  and \n(c) assist  that person  to ingest  or otherwise  self-administer  the medicine, \n15 but the decision  to self-administer  the medicine  and the final  act of doing  so \nmust  be taken  by the person  for whom  the medicine  has been  prescribed. \n(5) Subsection  (4) does  not authorise  an assisting  health  professional  to administer \na medicine  to another  person  with  the intention  of causing  that person’s \ndeath. \n20 (6) The assisting  health  professional  must  remain  with  the person  until  the person \nhas— \n(a) self-administered  the medicine  and died,  or \n(b) decided  not to self-administer  the medicine, \n25and for the purpose  of this subsection  the assisting  health  professional  is to \nbe regarded  as remaining  with  the person  if the assisting  health  professional \nis in close  proximity  to, but not necessarily  in the same  room  as, the person. \n(7) The Secretary  of State  may  by regulations  specify— \n(a) the medicines  which  may  be prescribed  under  this section , \n(b) \n30the form  and manner  in which  such  prescriptions  are to be issued, \nand \n(c) the manner  and conditions  under  which  such  medicines  are to be \ndispensed,  stored,  transported,  used  and destroyed. \n(8) Regulations  under  subsection  (7)(c) must  provide  that an assisting  health \nprofessional— \n35 (a) must  only  deliver  any medicines  prescribed  under  this section  to the \nperson  for whom  they  have  been  prescribed  immediately  before  their \nintended  use, and \n(b) in the event  that the person  decides  not to self-administer  the medicine, \n40must  immediately  remove  it from  that person  and,  as soon  as \nreasonably  practicable,  return  it to the pharmacy  from  which  it was \ndispensed. \n(9) Regulations  under  subsection  (7) may— \n(a) make  different  provision  for different  purposes;  and Assisted  Dying  for Terminally  Ill Adults  Bill [HL] 4 \n(b) include  consequential,  incidental,  supplementary  or transitional \nprovisions. \n(10) Regulations  under  this section  must  not be made  unless  a draft  of the statutory \n5instrument  containing  them  has been  laid before  Parliament  and approved \nby a resolution  of each  House  of Parliament. \n(11) In this section , “assisting  health  professional”  means  the attending  doctor  or \na person  authorised  by the attending  doctor  in accordance  with  subsection \n(2)(b). \n5 Conscientious  objection \n10 A person  is not under  any duty  (whether  by contract  or arising  from  any \nstatutory  or other  legal  requirement)  to participate  in anything  authorised  by \nthis Act to which  that person  has a conscientious  objection. \n6 Criminal  liability \n(1) \n15A person  who  provides  any assistance  in accordance  with  this Act is not \nguilty  of an offence. \n(2) A person  who  is in breach  of the requirements  of this Act, save  for acts or \nomissions  in good  faith  and without  negligence,  will be guilty  of a criminal \noffence  and will be liable,  on conviction  on indictment,  to imprisonment  for \na term  not exceeding  14 years. \n20 (3) In the Suicide  Act

    "blurb": "The Armed Forces Commissioner Bill, introduced on November 6, 2024, aims to establish the Armed Forces Commissioner, enhancing oversight and accountability for service personnel. It abolishes the Service Complaints Ombudsman, allowing proactive investigations into welfare issues. Key provisions include the Commissioner’s authority to access service premises and report findings to Parliament, addressing declining morale and systemic challenges within the Armed Forces. This initiative aligns with government commitments to improve service life.",
    "body": "ARMED FORCES COMMISSIONER BILL  \n \nMemorandum from the Ministry of Defence to the Delegated Powers and \nRegulatory Reform Committee  \n \n \nA. INTRODUCTION  \n \n1. This memorandum has been prepared for the Delegated Powers and \nRegulatory Reform  Committee to assist with its scrutiny of the  Armed Forces \nCommissioner Bill  (“the Bill”). The Bill was introduced in the House of \nCommons  on 6 November 2024 . This memorandum identifies the  provisions \nof the Bill that confer powers to make delegated legislation. It explains in  each \ncase why the power has been taken and explain s the nature of, and the reason \nfor, the procedure selected.  \n \nB.  PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE BILL  \n2. The Armed Forces Commissioner Bill will establish and confer functions on the \noffice of the Armed Forces Commissioner  and abolish the office of the Service \nComplaints Ombudsman  for the Armed Forces  (SCO AF). The Commissioner \nwill be able to proactively launch independent investigations  into issues \naffecting service personnel and their families more widely, and to lay those \nreports before Parliament. The Commissioner will be a direct point of contact \nfor serving personnel and their families, providing a strong, independent voice \nand increas ing parliamentary oversight and  Ministerial and departmental \naccountability to those who serve our nation.  \n \n3. The Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey has shown a fall in morale in \nour Armed Forces over the last decade and has also indicated systemic \nchallenges in terms of retaining our personnel. One of the first steps towards \ntackling this will be the establishment of a new Armed Forces Commissioner. \nThis is a Government manifesto commitment and is the first in a series of steps \nthat will be taken by the new Government to renew the nation’s contra ct with \nthose who serve, and to improve service life. \n \n4. The current remit of the SCO AF provides for the independent and impartial \noversight of the service complaints system for members of the UK Armed \nForces and is set out in the Armed Forces Act 2006. The current functions of \nthe office of SCO AF provide powers for them to help service personnel access \nthe service complaints system, investigate complaints and report to the \nSecretary of State annually on the operation of the service complaints \nsystem.  However, the SCO AF’s remit  is narrow. The Ombudsman can only \nlook into individual complaints, following completion of the service complaints \nprocess. Their remit is reactive and does not allow proactive investigations into \nissues facing our Armed Forces.  The office of the SCO AF will be abolished \nand, in addition to their new powers,  the Commissioner will incorporate the \nfunctions currently undertaken by the SCO AF.  \n \n \n  \n5. The main elements of the Bill are:  \n \na) Establish ing the office of the  Armed Forces Commissioner  in the Armed \nForces Act 2006.   \n \nb) The Commissioner’s new powers to investigate general service welfare \nmatters and the scope of such investigations. This will include an \nobligation on the Secretary of State to facilitate and co-operate with the \nCommissioner and consider any findings or recommendations made by \nthe Commissioner in connection with such an investigation.  \n \nc) The Commissioner’s new powers to enter service premises in \nconnection with an investigation into a general service welfare matter.  \nThis will include an ability for the Commissioner to access service \npremises with or without notice, subject to certain restrictions in relation \nto national security and personal safety.  \n \nd) The Commissioner’s expanded powers ( from those currently set out in \nthe Armed Forces Act 2006) to require information and documents for \nthe purposes of their investigations and related enforcement \nmechanisms.  \n \ne) The Commissioner’s new powers and requirements in relation to \nreports that are provided to the Secretary of State to lay before \nParliament. This will cover annual reporting requirements as well as \nspecific reports containing the results of investigations into general \nservice welfare matters.   \n \nf) Making a technical amendment to the service complaints process to \nensure that admissibility decisions can be made by civilians, as this is \ncurrently limited to certain officers.  \n \ng) Abolishing the current office of the SCOAF  and transferring their \nexisting functions to the Commissioner.   \n \n6. The Bill has been drafted in a way which minimises the use of delegated \npowers, with as much detail as possible contained on the face of the Bill . The \nBill therefore creates only 3 new powers.  Details of these are set out at \nsection C below.    \n \n \nC. DELEGATED POWERS  \n \nClause 4(2): Commissioner’s role in relation to general service welfare  (new \nsection 3 40IA (4)(e) (Commissioner investigations of general service welfare \nmatters ) \n \n \nPower conferred on : Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by : Regulations  \n \n \n \n Parliamentary Procedure : Affirmative  procedure  \n \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n7. Clause 4(2) inserts new section 3 40IA into the Armed Forces Act 2006 , which  \ncreates a power for the Commissioner to conduct  investigations into general \nservice welfare matters.  Subject to the following, the Bill provides that a \n“general service welfare matter” is a matter which in the Commissioner’s \nopinion arises in connection with the ongoing service of persons subject to \nservice law and may materially affect the welfare of those persons or relevant \nfamily members.  \n \n8. Subsection  (4) provides a list of matters that must be excluded. This list \nincludes matters which should more appropriately be dealt with via the service \ncomplaint system, or which relate to a service  inquiry, criminal investigation or \ncriminal proceedings , or public inquiry . Subsection (4)(e) then provides that \nthis list includes such other matters as may be specified by regulations made \nby the Secretary of  State .  \n \n \nJustification  for taking the power  \n \n9. MOD anticipates that certain defence matters  should not be within the remit of \nthe Commissioner’s thematic reports.  However,  due to the evolving (and \nsometimes urgent) nature of UK defence, there is a need to preserve the ability \nto respond and update the remit regularly and quickly.  It is therefore not \nconsidered appropriate to provide full detail on the face of the bill and  it would \nrun the risk of  becom ing quickly  outdated . \n \n10. However, t he regulation -making power is limited by subsection (6), which \nstates that an y such  matter may only be one in  which the Secretary of State \nconsiders would impinge on  national security or might jeopardise the safety of \nany person . This  narrowing of the power ensur es minimal  restriction  (generally \nor in a particular case)  of the Commissioner’s discretion to launch \ninvestigations into a wide range of matters and thus supports their \nindependence  whilst providing that there are appropriate safeguards in place . \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n11. Given the  potential for any regulations made under the power in subsection \n(4)(e) to contain important limit s to the scope of the Commissioner’s \ninvestigations (a fundamental  power in the exercise  of their functions), it is \nconsidered appropriate to ensure that they re ceive a high degree of scrutiny  \nand therefore should be subject to the affirmative procedure . This is achieved \nby amending section 373 Armed Forces Act.  \n \nClause 4(2): Commissioner’s role in relation to general service welfare ( new \nsection 3 40IA(8) (Commissioner investigations of general service welfare \nmatters )) \n \nPower conferred on : Secretary of State  \n \n \n  \nPower exercised by : Regulations  \n \nParliamentary Procedure : Negative  procedure  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n12. Clause 1(1) inserts new section 3 65AA and clause 4(2) inserts new section \n340IA into the Armed Forces Act 2006. Subsection (2)(a)(ii)  and (ii) of new \nsection 365AA  provide that the functions of the Commissioner are to promote \nthe welfare of persons subject to service law and relevant family members, \nand to  improve the public’s  understanding of the issues faced by persons \nsubject to service law and by relevant family members . New section 3 40IA \ncreates a power for the Commissioner to conduct investigations into general \nservice welfare matters. Subsection s (2)(a) and ( 2)(b) provide  that a “general \nservice welfare matter” is a matter which in the Commissioner’s opinion arises \nin connection with the ongoing service of person s subject to service law and \nmay materially affect the welfare of those persons or relevant family members.  \n \n13. To enable these provisions to be properly understood and applied, it is \ntherefore necessary to define a “relevant family member ”. Subsection (8) \nprovides that this may be specified  in regulations made by the Secretary of \nState.   \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n14. There is potentially a wide range of individuals who may be considered \nsufficiently connected to a service person to constitute a family member for the \npurposes of the Commissioner’s functions under new section 3 65AA and new \nsection 3 40IA. Trying to overly constrain  this definition may risk suggesting \nthat family in this context is more of a traditional nuclear family  and may not \nreflect differing circumstances (such as the bereaved) and changing \nunderstandings of what constitutes “family” in this context. There is therefore \nlikely to be a degree of fine and technical detail that would not be appropriate \nto set out on the face of the bill. In addition, t here is a desire to not overly \nrestrict the definition in primary legislation to provide a degree of flexibility with \nregards to the definition and ensure that it is adequately future -proofed.  \n \n15. In addition to the above, there is  existing precedent contained in section \n343B(4) Armed Forces Act 2006 which similarly provides that the definition of \n“relevant family member” is contained in secondary legislation , relevant for the \nArmed Forces Covenant . The principles under the Covenant and the remit of \nthe Commissioner will operate in a similar policy space (the welfare / effect of \nservice on service persons and their families). There is therefore a strong \npolicy desire to ensure that the two definition s of “relevant family member” \nretain parity as far as possible. It may be impractical to be relying on almost \nthe same definition but having different procedures for amending them, and \nalso inconsistent if the definition for the Commissioner was contained in the \nArmed Forces Act 2006 but the definition for the Covenant was not.   \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n \n \n 16. The negative resolution procedure is considered to provide an appropriate \nlevel of scrutiny as the subject matter of the regulations is not controversial in \nnature and there is nothing about the drafting of the enabling power that is \nnovel, contentious or unusual. The regulations would be a procedural matter \nto simply ensure that the legislation works most appropriately to the different \ncircumstances in which it will be applied.  \n \n17. The power has been tightly drafted, so that it only applies to the \nCommissioner’s functions under new section 3 65AA and new section 3 40IA. \n \n \nClause 7: Commencement   \n  \nPower conferred on : Secretary of State   \n  \nPower exercised by : Regulations made by statutory instrument   \n  \nParliamentary Procedure : None   \n  \nContext and Purpose   \n \n18. Subsection (1) of c lause 7 of the Bill confers on the Secretary of State a \nregulation -making power to bring into force the Bill (except clauses 6, 7 and 8) \non such day as they may appoint.  Subsection (3) provides that the Secretary \nof State may also by regulations make transitional, transitory or saving \nprovision in connection with the coming into force of any provision of the Bill.  \n  \nJustification for taking the power   \n  \n19. This is a standard clause for commencing the provisions of an Act, and making \nsaving and transitional provisions related to commencement, by regulations.    \n \n20. Leaving a subset of provisions in the Bill, other than those for which the Bill \nitself provides the commencement date, to be brought into force by regulations \nwill afford the necessary flexibility to commence the provisions of the Bill at the \nappropriate t ime, having regard to the need to make any necessary secondary \nlegislation,  appoint and set up the Commissioner’s office, issue guidance  and \nupdate policies as appropriate , and put the necessary systems and \nprocedures in place, as the case may be.    \n  \nJustification for the procedure   \n \n21. It is standard practice for the power to bring into force the provisions of an Act \non a specified day not to require any further Parliamentary procedure.   \n \n \n \n \nMinistry of Defence  \n21 January 2025",

Th\nis Bill amends the Railways Act 1993 (“the 1993 Act”) to remove the\npresumption in favour of private sector operation of franchised passenger\nservices. It is intended to facilitate the Government’s commitment tobring such train operations back into public ownership when the currentfranchise agreements end. The Bill contains two delegated powers, and theDepartment for Transport has provided a delegated powers memorandum(“the memorandum”).\n1 We draw the attention of the House to one of those\npowers.\n2. Th\ne Bill operates by generally prohibiting both the extension of existing\nprivate sector franchise agreements and the entering into of new suchagreements. However, the Bill also inserts two new sections into the 1993Act (sections 30A and 30B) which will allow the continuation of the existingprivate sector franchise arrangements, where the Secretary of State is thefranchising authority and is satisfied that it will not be reasonably practicableto provide passenger rail services by a public sector company when theexisting private sector franchise agreement comes to an end.\n3.\nSu\nbsection (4) of section 30A enables the Secretary of State by regulations\nto repeal that section and section 30B. Despite being a Henry VIII power,the regulations are subject only to the negative resolution procedure. Theuse of the negative resolution procedure is explained in paragraph 16 of thememorandum on the basis of the limited scope of the power and the fact thatthe power is intended only for the purpose of removing the provisions oncethey become obsolete.\n4.\nWe c\nonsider that the negative resolution procedure would be appropriate if\nthe power could only be exercised once sections 30A and 30B are spent (whichwill be the case when all the existing private sector franchising arrangementshave come to an end). However, that limitation does not appear in section30A(4) as drafted; instead it simply confers a power on the Secretary of Stateto repeal sections 30A and 30B, without limiting the circumstances in whichthe power may be exercised.\n5.\nAc\ncordingly, we recommend that the House seeks clarification from\nthe Minister as to:\n• whether the Government intend that the power to repeal sections30A and 30B should only be exercised once all the existing privatesector franchising arrangements have come to an end; and\n• why, if that is the intention, the power is not limited so that itmay only be exercised in those circumstances.\nWe also take the view that, in the absence of such a limitation, the affirmative resolution procedure should apply.\n1 Memorandum on the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill from the Department for \nTransport to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (5 September 2024): https://\nbills.parliament.uk/publications/56125/documents/5043\n2\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n PRODUCT REGULATION AND METROLOGY BILL [HL]\n6. T\nhis Bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 4 September. Its Second\nReading took place on 8 October.\n7. T\nhe Bill makes provision with respect to:\n• the marketing and use of products;\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether\nof goods or other things); and\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed.\n8. T\nhe Bill contains 14 clauses and one schedule.\n9. T\nhe Department for Business and Trade has provided a Delegated Powers\nMemorandum (“the Memorandum”)2 for the Bill.\n10. W\ne draw the following powers to the attention of the House.\n Clause 1, 2, 3 and 9—powers to make product regulations\n11. T\nhese clauses make provision with respect to the regulation of the marketing\nand use of all products3 (both consumer products and industrial products)\nin the UK save only for the “excluded products” listed in the Schedule tothe Bill. The excluded products include food, products of animal origin,aircraft, military equipment, medicines and medical devices.\n12.\nC\nlause 1 gives the Secretary of State power to make provision by regulations\nin relation to the marketing or use of products in the UK (“productregulations”), for the purpose of:\n• reducing or mitigating risks presented by products;\n• ensuring that products operate efficiently or effectively; or\n• ensuring that products designed for weighing or measuring operateaccurately.\n13.\nC\nlause 1 also gives the Secretary of State power to include in product\nregulations provision which corresponds, or is similar, to a provision of EUlaw\n4 for the purpose of reducing or mitigating the environmental impact of\nproducts.\n14. C\nlause 2 sets out matters in relation to which product regulations may impose\n“product requirements”. It also specifies categories of persons on whom suchrequirements may be imposed. Clause 2(7) allows product regulations toprovide that “product requirements” are to be treated as met if requirementsof EU law specified in those regulations are met.\n2 Memorandum on the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill [HL] from the Department for Business \nand Trade to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (30 August 2024): https://\nbills.parliament. uk/publications/56126/documents/5044\n3 “Product” is broadly defined in clause 1(5) as “a tangible item that results from a method of \nproduction”.\n4 The provision must correspond, or be similar, to a provision of “relevant EU law”, which means EU \nlaw that has the purpose of harmonising the conditions for the marketing or use of products in the EU.\n3\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n15. Clause 3 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of product \nregulations.\n16. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby product regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by Parts \n2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof Acts \n1868 to 1978 and section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights Act \n2015.\n17. The power to make product regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised:\n• to create or widen the scope of a criminal offence;\n• to create powers of entry, inspection or search;\n• to disapply or modify product regulations in cases of emergency;\n• to make provision about the disclosure of information by or to a relevant \nauthority5 carrying out functions under product regulations;\n• to make provision for a relevant authority to impose fees in respect of \ncosts incurred by the authority in carrying out its functions; or\n• to amend or repeal primary legislation.\n Skeleton legislation\n18. Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill are an example of what the Committee refers \nto as “skeleton legislation”. They contain almost no substance about the \nmarketing and use of products but instead give Ministers very broad powers \nwhich confer considerable discretion to legislate in that area by statutory \ninstrument. Almost all of the substance of the regulatory regime that is to \ngovern the marketing and use of products (including product safety) is to \nbe left to regulations. Even existing provision in primary legislation may \nbe replaced by provision in regulations. And the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied.\n19. The concern with “skeleton legislation” is its compatibility with the \nestablished principle that the principal aspects of policy should be on the face \nof a bill and only its detailed implementation left to delegated legislation. As \nwe stated in our Democracy Denied Report6: “Skeleton legislation signifies \nan exceptional shift in power from Parliament to the executive and entails \nthe Government, in effect, asking Parliament to pass primary legislation \nwhich is so insubstantial that it leaves the real operation of the legislation to \nbe decided by ministers”7.\n20. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee8 states that “Skeleton legislation should only be used in the most \nexceptional circumstances”. It adds that, if a Bill contains a skeleton clause, \n5 Under clause 3, product regulations may designate a person as a “relevant authority” with powers to \nenforce product regulations.\n6 12th Report  (Session 2021–22, HL Paper 106)\n7 At para 66.\n8 Guidance for Departments (December 2023): https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/42694/\ndocuments/212126/default/\n4\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nthe Delegated Powers Memorandum that a department must prepare to assist \nthe Committee with its scrutiny of the Bill should provide a full justification \nfor this approach, including why no other approach was reasonable to adopt \nand how the scope of the skeleton provision is constrained.\n21. We consider that the Memorandum fails to meet this requirement in respect \nof clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill.\n22. The first respect in which the Memorandum falls short is in its explanation \nof the existing legislation that could be amended and indeed replaced by \nregulations made under the powers in those clauses.\n23. Both the Memorandum and the Explanatory Notes to the Bill have little to \nsay about that existing legislation beyond high-level statements such as the \nfollowing:\n• the sale and supply of the “huge number” of products to which the Bill \napplies is “underpinned by an extensive body of law”9;\n• “the legal landscape is complex and technical, primarily set out in \nsecondary legislation and based on assimilated law”10 (the body of UK \ndomestic law derived originally from EU obligations); and\n• “The product regulatory framework in the UK covers most consumer \nproducts, for example toys and cosmetics, and a significant number \nof industrial products too, such as lifts and pressure equipment. The \noverwhelming majority of this legislation is assimilated law, transposed \ninto UK law while the UK was part of the EU and then assimilated \nfollowing the EU exit process”11.\n24. The Memorandum fails to identify the legislation in question or to explain \nwhat it does or its significance in policy terms. It even fails to explain in any \ndetail the content and significance in policy terms of the primary legislation \nthat could be replaced by regulations made under the Bill.\n25. This scarcity of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make. This gives rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nthe Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might be considered \nsufficiently important in policy terms to instead merit inclusion in the \nBill itself, where they would be subject to the much greater Parliamentary \nscrutiny afforded to primary legislation.\n26. This most obviously applies to those aspects of the existing regulatory \nregime that are contained in primary legislation that the Bill allows to be \nreplaced and repealed by product regulations12. The fact that the Bill allows \nthis merits a full explanation and a compelling justification. Yet although the \nMemorandum states that the repeal of that primary legislation by regulations \nis sufficiently important to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny, it offers no \nexplanation as to why matters that have hitherto been considered sufficiently \n9 At para 2 of the Memorandum.\n10 At para 13 of the Memorandum. “Assimilated law” includes (a) post-EU Exit UK versions of EU \nRegulations, and (b) UK statutory instruments made to give effect to EU obligations.\n11 At para 5 of the Explanatory Notes.\n12 Consumer Protection Act 1987, parts  2, 4 and 5; Gun Barrel Proof Acts 1868 to  1978 ; Consumer \nRights Act 2015, section 77  and schedule 5 .\n5\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in primary legislation should be \nleft to regulations at all.\n27.  It is also unclear whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nare currently contained in assimilated law (the body of UK domestic law \nderived originally from EU obligations) that might be considered sufficiently \nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in the Bill rather than in \nregulations.\n28. Even where that assimilated law is contained in subordinate legislation, \nthat is not by itself a good reason for any replacement provisions also to be \ncontained in subordinate legislation. This is a point that we have made in \nseveral previous reports, including our report on the Medicines and Medical \nDevices Bill13, where the Government sought to justify wide skeleton powers \non the basis that it was replacing one set of regulations with another. In that \ncase, we emphasised14 that the existing regulations had been made under the \nspecial power in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, the \npurpose of which was to allow EU law requirements to be implemented in \nUK domestic law by subordinate legislation - and that the power in section \n2(2) was subject to “a critical constraint”: it gave Ministers “power to make \nlaws giving effect to EU law–not simply power to make laws that Ministers \nmay wish to make”.\n29. In our report on the Energy Bill, we stated that:\n“the fact that provisions governing a subject area are currently contained \nin regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities \nAct 1972 does not by itself make it appropriate to use a regulation-\nmaking power to amend and extend the provisions in that subject area. \nInstead, the proposal to confer regulation-making powers needs to be \njustified on its own merits, particularly where, as in these cases, they are \nframework powers which are therefore capable of providing a very broad \nscope of regulation-making powers to the Secretary of State.”15\n30. The justification given in the Memorandum for the powers in clauses 1, 2, 3 \nand 9 is that:\n• aspects of the regulatory regime for products may need to be updated \nswiftly and frequently (for example “to respond to emerging hazards \nand risks, and developments in technology and scientific or technical \nunderstanding”16); and\n• the powers will give Ministers the flexibility to legislate to align UK law \nwith EU rules or to diverge from those rules.\n31. We consider that, whilst these may be reasonable arguments for the Bill \nconferring powers that allow some aspects of the regulatory regime for \nproducts to be provided for in delegated legislation, the Government have \nnot explained why the Bill goes so much further and instead provides for \nalmost all of the substance of that regulatory regime to be provided for by \nMinisters in regulations under the new powers, with little or nothing to be \nsettled under the fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions.\n13 19th Report  (Session 2019–21, HL Paper 109).\n14 At para 20.\n15 11th Report  (Session 2022–23, HL Paper 66), para 44.\n16 At para 38.\n6\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n32. The concern with powers of this kind is that they give Ministers maximum \nflexibility to choose the direction that the law will take. Ministers could, \nshould they so wish, use these powers as a mechanism for ensuring that \nUK domestic law on product regulation is completely aligned with EU law. \nAlternatively, they could use the powers to provide for UK domestic law to \ndiverge in significant respects from EU law. Whatever direction Ministers \nmay choose to take the law in - and however significant in policy terms that \nmay be–it is to be done by means of delegated legislation that will be subject \nonly to a relatively low level of parliamentary scrutiny.\n33. The Memorandum also fails to explain why  the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirements for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied - and it fails to say whether this \nrepresents a divergence from the existing regulatory regime. We note with \ninterest that at least one existing regulation-making power that the powers to \nmake product regulations are designed to replace (the power of the Secretary \nof State under section 11 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to make \n“safety regulations” with respect to goods) is, unlike the new powers, subject \nto consultation requirements.\n Power to set the ingredients of criminal offences\n34. Clause 3(9)(a) is particularly worthy of mention. It provides that product \nregulations may create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences for such \nthings as non-compliance with product regulations or obstruction of, or \nfailure to assist or co-operate with, a product safety inspector.\n35. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee states as follows17:\n“Where the ingredients of a criminal offence are to be set by delegated \nlegislation, the Committee would expect a compelling justification”.\nThe Memorandum explains18 why it considers the power in clause 3(9)(a) to \nbe sufficiently significant to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny but it fails \nto provide a justification for taking the power in the first place.\n36. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for products; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n Clauses 5, 6 and 9—powers to make metrology regulations\n37. Clause 5 gives the Secretary of State power to make “metrology regulations”, \nabout:\n17 Guidance for Departments (November 2021), para 12: https://committees.parliament.uk/\npublications/8225/documents/84262 /default/\n18 At para 54.\n7\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether \nof goods19 or other things), including how such units of measurement \nmust or may be calculated;\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed; and\n• the units of measurement that must or may be used to express such \nquantities.\n38. Metrology regulations may impose requirements in relation to matters \nincluding:\n• the marketing or packaging of goods;\n• the monitoring, assessment and verification of the quantities in which \ngoods are marketed and the units of measurement used to express such \nquantities; and\n• the retention of documents and information.\n39. Clause 6 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of metrology \nregulations. The provision made is identical in all material respects to that \nmade in clause 3 with respect to the enforcement of product regulations.\n40. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby metrology regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by \nParts 2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof \nActs 1868 to 1978, section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights \nAct 2015 and the Weights and Measures Act 1985.\n41. The power to make metrology regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised for purposes equivalent to those specified in \nparagraph 17 above with respect to the power to make product regulations.\n42. Clauses 5, 6 and 9 are another example of “skeleton legislation”. They \ncontain almost no substance about units of measurement and the quantities \nin which goods must or may be marketed. Instead, they confer very broad \npowers to make such provision by regulations.\n43. We consider that the concerns set out above with respect to the powers to \nmake product regulations apply equally to the powers to make metrology \nregulations, namely that:\n• almost all of the substance is left to regulations;\n• skeleton legislation is only justifiable in the most exceptional \ncircumstances and the Memorandum fails to provide the full \njustification that we expect where a Bill takes this approach;\n• the Memorandum fails to adequately explain the content—and \nsignificance in policy terms—of the existing legislation that could be \namended and indeed replaced by metrology regulations;\n• this lack of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make, giving rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the existing regulatory \n19 “Goods” are broadly defined in clause 5(4) as “tangible items (including packaging or labels)”.\n8\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nregime that the Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might \nbe considered sufficiently important to merit inclusion in the Bill;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace and repeal primary \nlegislation merits a full explanation and a compelling justification but \nthe Memorandum fails to provide this;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace all aspects of the \nexisting regulatory regime that are currently contained in assimilated \nlaw merits a full explanation and justification but the Memorandum \nfails to provide this;\n• the Government argues that aspects of the regulatory regime may need \nto be updated swiftly and frequently but they have not explained why \nthe Bill provides for almost all of the substance of that regime to be \nprovided for in regulations, with little or nothing to be settled under \nthe fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions;\n• the Memorandum fails to explain why the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or \nfor meaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied; and\n• the Memorandum fails to provide a justification for the power in clause \n6(9)(a) to create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences.\n44. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for metrology; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 5, 6 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n9\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n WATER (SPECIAL MEASURES) BILL [HL]\n45.

This report sets out the Committee’s observations in relation to a private \nmember’s Bill. It has long been, and remains, the Committee’s approach to \napply the same exacting standards of scrutiny to all bills, whether a government \nbill or a private member’s bill. We acknowledge however that those members \nof the House who sponsor private members’ bills, unlike ministers, do not \nhave the support of departmental officials and Parliamentary Counsel in \nthe preparation of their bills. Our comments on private members’ bills are \nframed in the light of that understanding.\n LITHIUM-ION BATTERY SAFETY BILL [HL]\n2. This private member’s Bill is intended to make provision for the safe storage, \nuse and disposal of lithium-ion batteries. It is due to have its second reading \non 6 September. There is no delegated powers memorandum as the Bill has \nnot been produced with the help of the Government.\n3. The Bill contains five regulation making powers each of which would appear \nto allow for the creation of criminal offences:\n• Two of the regulation making powers are explicit in conferring powers \nto create offences. In those cases, there is also a power to provide for \nthe imposition of civil sanctions (clauses 3 and 4).\n• In one case the power to create an offence appears to be a necessary \nconsequence of the power being conferred (clause 2).\n• In the other two cases, the nature of the regulation making power \nrequires an enforcement mechanism, but without making it explicit \nwhat the nature of the enforcement mechanism is. Such a mechanism \nwould have to be the creation of offences or the imposition of civil \nsanctions (clauses 5 and 6).\n4. All of the powers in the Bill are subject to the negative resolution procedure. \nIn our guidance to Departments1, we make it clear that the use of subordinate \nlegislation to create criminal offences should be treated as exceptional and \nthat it should only be done where there is a compelling justification. We \nalso consider that, where subordinate legislation is used to create criminal \noffences (or where it is used to impose civil sanctions), it should be subject to \nthe affirmative resolution procedure.\n5. In the circumstances, we consider that the Bill should be amended \nso that the regulation making powers conferred by it are all made \nsubject to the affirmative resolution procedure .\n6. Clause 5 requires the Secretary of State to make regulations regarding the \nsafety standards for conversion kits for use with micromobility vehicles that \nrun on lithium-ion batteries, and relating to the use of charging systems for \nelectric-powered micromobility vehicles. Clause 6 requires the Secretary of \n1 Paragraph 12 of the Guidance for Departments , December 2023.\n2\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nState to make regulations with respect to the disposal of lithium-ion batteries. \nIn both cases, although any requirements imposed by the regulations would \nneed to be enforced in order to be effective, nothing is said on the face of the \nBill as to what provision may be made in the regulations for the enforcement \nof their requirements. As noted above, it seems to us that the only possible \nenforcement mechanisms would be either the creation of criminal offences \nor the imposition of civil sanctions.\n7. We consider that clauses 5 and 6 are defective in failing to specify \nthe provision which is to be made in the regulations to enforce the \nrequirements imposed by them. We consider that the failure to \nspecify the enforcement mechanisms is particularly objectionable \nif the intention is that they should include the creation of criminal \noffences, given the constitutional significance of using subordinate \nlegislation in this way.\n ARBITRATION BILL [HL]\n8. There is nothing in this Bill which we would wish to draw to the attention of \nthe House.\n BANK RESOLUTION (RECAPITALISATION) BILL [HL]\n9. There is nothing in this Bill which we would wish to draw to the attention of \nthe House.\n BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY BILL\n10. There is nothing in this Money Bill which we would wish to draw to the \nattention of the House.\n COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY ASSOCIATION AND \nINTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (STATUS) \nBILL [HL]\n11.

    "event_name": "Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill",
    "blurb": "The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, introduced on January 30, 2025, aims to enhance UK border security, streamline immigration processes, and bolster data sharing among agencies. Key provisions include new powers for law enforcement, updates to the asylum system, and enhanced penalties for organized immigration crime. The bill emphasizes adaptability to emerging threats and includes delegated powers subject to parliamentary scrutiny.",
    "body": "1 \n BORDER SECURITY, ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION  BILL  \n \nMemorandum from the Home Office to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory \nReform Committee  \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n \n1. This memorandum has been prepared for the Delegated Powers and Regulatory \nReform Committee to assist with its scrutiny of the  Border Security, Asylum and \nImmigration  Bill (“the Bill”). The Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on \n30 January 2025.   \n \n2. This memorandum identifies the provisions of the Bill which  confer new or \namended powers to make delegated legislation. It explains in each case why the \npower has been taken and explains the nature of, and the reason for, the \nprocedure selected.  \n \nPURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE BILL  \n \n3. The Bill makes provision for a variety of measures relating to border security, \nasylum and immigration , falling into four pillars .  \n \n4. Pillar 1 provides the framework which enables the Border Security Commander, \nand the Border Security Command (BSC ), to fulfil their  role as an effective border \nsecurity system leader, cohering and driving improvements to  the collective \nresponse to current and future threats . \n \n5. Pillar 2 expands data sharing capabilities between government departments and \nagencies to assist in developing the intelligence picture for organised immigration \ncrime (OIC)  and other threats to UK border security. The improved sharing of data \nwill enhance abilities to identify risks, whether for policing, customs, immigration, \nor wider law enforcement ( OIC and/or serious and organised crime) purposes; as \nwell as to prevent the loss of human life.  \n \n6. Pillar 3 creates new and enhanced measures  to strengthen border security . This \nincludes an array of new, stronger powers for law enforcement agencies to \ninvestigate and prosecute OIC, and it provides additional deterrents and \npenalties for criminals involved in OIC. Pillar 3 also introduces n ew and \nenhanced tools that will allow for faster interventions against those suspected of \nbeing involved in serious and organised crime  and enables  restrictions to be \nplaced  on them.  \n \n7. Pillar 4 introduces new, additional measures to support and strengthen the UK’s \nimmigration and asylum system.  The Bill repeals the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum \nand Immigration) Act 2024  and parts within  the Illegal Migration Act 2023.  \n \n8. To support its policy objectives and ensure the ability  to adapt to future threats to \nborder security, the Bill includes a number of delegated powers. In general terms, \nthe bulk of the powers will allow for proportionate changes to the environment in \nwhich partners across the border security and law enforcement systems operate. \nWhere possible, regulation -making powers are subject to consultation \nrequirements.  \n \n2 \n DELEGATED POWERS  \n9. The Bill includes the following measures which contain new or amended \ndelegated powers : \ni. Enhanced OIC Powers: Supplying and handling articles for use in \nimmigration crime ; \nii. Enhanced OIC Powers : Powers of search and seizure in relation to \nelectronic devices ; \niii. Sharing of trailer registration information ; \niv. Extension  of personnel who can take biometric information ; \nv. New criminal offences to criminalise the making, adapting, importing, \nsupplying, offering to supply and possession of articles for use in \nserious crime;  and \nvi. New powers to strengthen the operation of Serious Crime Prevention \nOrders . \n \nAnalysis of delegated powers by clause  \n \nClause 15(3)  - Power to add to the list of articles which are not relevant articles \nfor the purposes of the possession and handling OIC offences  \n \nPower conferred on:    Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:    Regulations made by statutory instrument  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:    Draft a ffirmative  procedure  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n10. Clause 13 creates an offence in relation to supplying articles for use in immigration \ncrime. Clause 14 create s an offence in relation to handling articles  for use in \nimmigration crime.  Clause 15(1) provides that for the purposes of these offences, \n“relevant article” means anything or substance other than the items listed in \nparagraph (a) to (h).  \n \n11. Clause 15(3) confers a power on the Secretary of State by regulations to add  \nitems or substances  to that list, and to make provision which is consequential on \nprovision made under 15(3)  to add  any items or substances to that list.  \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n12. The power to add to the list is required  so that, if necessary , in view of the policy \nobjective that it should not be an offence to supply or handle articles listed in \nclause 15(1), it is possible to add items to the list if appropriate to do so in the \nfuture  to ensure that the list of items carved out from the offence remains up to \ndate and relevant with any changes to methods of irregular entry to the UK and \nany technological updates to life saving equipment . The power  to make provision \nwhich is consequential on adding any items or substances woul d, for example, \nenabl e the addition of a new subsection in the clause if a new item or substance \nbeing added to subsection 15(1) required a definition. It would also enable, if \nappropriat e, in light of any item or substance to be added, subsection 15(2) to be \namended  so that it were to apply in relation to the new item or substance.   \n \n3 \n Justification for the procedure  \n \n13. The regulation -making power in clause 15(3) is subject to the draft affirmative \nprocedure. This is considered appropriate as this power , if exercised, would \nchange the scope of a criminal offence . The draft affirmative procedure is also \nappropriate given that this is a Henry VIII power. Parliament should have the \nopportunity to debate and approve any new articles that the power would allow to \nbe added to the list in clause 15(1).  \n \nClause 25(1)(a) and (b) – Power through  regulations to make references to an \nauthorised officer  or an immigration officer , to include a person of a description \nspecified in the regulations and permit the use of reasonable force in the \nexercise of any function  \n \nPower conferred on :   Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by :   Regulations made by statutory instrument  \n \nParliamentary Procedure :   Negative  procedure  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n14. Clauses 1 9 to 26 create powers for immigration officers and police constables \n(who receive  authorisation by a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent , \nin England and Wales ) (“authorised officers ”) to search persons who have arrived \nor entered the UK in the way described in clause 19(3) for anything which appears \nto an authorised officer  to be a thing on which information that relates, or may \nrelate, to the commission (whether in the past or future) of an offence under \nsection 25 or 25A of the Immigration Act 1971 is, or may be, stored in electronic \nform. Those clauses also create powers of retention and use in relation to such \nitems , alongside powers for immigration officers to pass on articles to other law \nenforcement in  certain  circumstances . \n \n15. Clause 2 5 creates two new powers:  \n \na. Clause 25(1)(a) gives the Secretary of State the power through regulations \nto provide that references to an authorised  officer in the provisions in \nrelation to electronic devices include a person of a description specified in \nthe regulations.  Clause 2 5(2) provides that the descriptions of person that \nmay be so specified include persons designated by the Secretary of State \nin accordance with the regulations . \nb. Clause 25(1)(b) gives the Secretary of State power through those \nregulations to provide that a person so specified may, if necessary, use \nreasonable force in the exercise of any function conferred by virtue of the \nregulations.  Immigration officers are already empowered, if necessary, to \nuse reasonable force by section 146  of the  Immigration and Asylum Act \n1999.  Clause 20(8) also provides this power for constables.  \n \n16. Clause 25(3) provides that where persons are designated by the Secretary of \nState as mentioned in subsection (2), the regulations must contain such \nsafeguards relating to the designation as the Secretary of State considers \nappropriate.  \n \n4 \n Justification for taking the power  \n \n17. The Home Office’s policy intention is that the new provisions will be made \navailable immediately to authorised  officers. However, it wishes to preserve the \nability to expand the scope of those who can use the powers. This will enable the \nSecretary of State in the future to authorise other cohorts of officials, to use the \npowers  if that proves necessary and appropriate. There are analogous powers \n(exercisable administratively rather than via secondary legislation) that enable the \nSecretary of State to confer  certain coercive powers on other specified categories \nof person, see 25CA to 25CC of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971  for \nexample paragraphs .  \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n18. The negative procedure is considered to afford an appropriate level of \nparliamentary scrutiny . Any regulations made would not create any new powers \nbut would extend the cohort of people who can use them. Additionally, clause \n25(3) provides that if any such regulations include persons designated by the \nSecretary of State, the regulations must contain such safeguards relating to the \ndesignation of persons as the Secretary of State considers necessary.  \n \nClause  33(8) – Power to make regulations “specif ying purposes relat ed to \npolicing ” for which information may be supplied under clauses 30(7)(a) and \n31(1)(iii) \n \nPower conferred on:    Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:    Regulations made by statutory instrument  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:    Draft a ffirmative procedure  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n19. Clause 33(8) gives the Secretary of State the power to specify in regulations any \npurposes related to policing for which the Secretary of State for Transport may \nsupply trailer registration information to a UK Authorised Person  (specified \npersons within UK police bodies) , and for which recipients of trailer registration \ninformation may further disclose that information to a person exercising public \nfunctions. A UK Authorised Person is defined by reference to a table set out at \n33(3), which lists a range of recipients who are  members of UK policing bodies.  \n \n20. The Home Office policy intention is to define the purposes related to policing in -\nline with paragraph 1.6 of the Police information and records management (PIRM) \nCode of Practice  (published July 2023); section 5 of the Code of Practice for the \nPolice National Computer (PNC) and the Law Enforcement Data Service (LEDS)  \n(published February 2023) ; and as set out in part 1 of the Police Service of \nNorthern Ireland (PSNI) Service Policy on Information Management (SP0816)  \n(published October 2016 ). The Codes were laid before Parliament pursuant to \nSection 39A(5) of the Police Act 1996. Both Codes and the PSNI Service Policy \ncontain a common core definition of police purposes as follows:  \n \n• protecting life and property  \n \n5 \n • preserving order  \n• preventing the commission of offences  \n• bringing offenders to justice  \n• any other police duty or responsibility arising from common or statute law . \n \n21. The Home Office wishes to preserve the ability to amend the scope of those \npolicing purposes in  line with wider developments in policing policy that may occur \nfrom time  to time – including to the above Codes – and therefore require s a \nregulation -making power. This will enable the Secretary of State in future to use \nthis power, with the consent of Parliament, if necessary and appropriate to do so.  \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n22. The reason  for taking this power is two -fold:  \n \na) Firstly, defining “purposes related to policing” in regulations, rather than \non the face of the Bill, will mitigate the risk of unintended consequences. \nWhile there is a recognised core definition of “purposes related to \npolicing” in both the Codes of Prac tice and the Service Policy referred, \nthere is no such definition to be found in primary legislation. The policy \nintention is not to fill this void and risk unintended consequences, such as \nthe definition being read across to wider police law in the UK. This \nmeasure is intended to relate only to the supply of trailer registration \ninformation taking this power will help ensure that this is clear.  \n \nb) Secondly, the ability to update the list by way of regulations will enable \nthe legislation to keep step with any changes that are made to policing \ncodes of practice. This will help avoid unnecessary  inconsistencies \nacross  the definitions that may emerge between those applicable to the \ntrailer registration data, and the Codes of Practice regulating police \ninformation and records management , and the L aw Enforcement Data \nSystem ( LEDS ), respectively. LEDS will be  the principal  system through \nwhich trailer registration data will be made available to the police (in -line \nwith clause 30(7)). Were the Secretary of State minded to amend the \ndefinition of the purposes related to policing in the Codes of Practice, the \nability to  dynamically  amend the same with respect to trailer registration \ninformation will be vital to avoiding a divergence  in operational definitions \nby putting draft regulations to  Parliament at a similar time.  \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n23. Clause 33(9) will place a duty on the Secretary of State to consult such persons \nas they consider appropriate before exercising this power. Further more , the \nregulation making power will be subject to the affirmative procedure, which will \nensure an appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n Clause 42(2)(b)  Prescribe through regulations ‘other authorised persons’ to \ncapture biometric information  \n \nPower conferred on:    Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:    Regulations made by statutory instrumen t \n \nParliamentary Procedure:    Negative procedure  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n24. Section 141 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (fingerprinting) is amended \nto confer a power on the Secretary of State to designate additional persons as an \nauthorised person  who can take fingerprints from foreign nationals under the \nsection.  \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n25. The principal policy objective is to create greater legislative flexibility as to the \npersons that can be designated an authorised person , with the aim of providing \ngreater resilience in biometric information  capturing capabilities during a crisis/at \ntimes of high demand . The measure s might be used, for example, to add trained \narmy officers to the list of authorised person s so that they can take biometric \ninformation  when facilitating an evacuation.  \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n26. This is to ensure a quick  response  to emergency situations. This power would \nhave proved helpful following  the evacuation from Afghanistan in August 2021, \nwhen a large number of people’s biometrics needed to be enrolled when they \narrived at the UK’s border. If an affirmative approach  was adopted , changes  may \nnot be capable of being implement ed quickly, affecting the ability to adapt as \nquickly as needed.  \n \nClause 44(3), (4) and (5) - Power to amend meaning of “relevant article” for use \nin serious crime  \n \nPower conferred on:    Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:    Regulations made by statutory instrument  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:    Draft affirmative procedure  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n27. Clause 43(1) and (2) create two new criminal offences:  \n \na. An offence of possessing a relevant article in circumstances which give rise \nto a reasonable suspicion that the relevant article will be used in connection \nwith any serious offence; and  \n \n \n7 \n b. An offence of importing, making, adapting, supplying or offering to supply \na relevant article in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable \nsuspicion that the relevant article will be used in connection with any \nserious offence. Serious offence means an offence specified or described \nin Schedule 1 of the Serious Crime Act 2007.  \n \n28. It is a defence for a person charged with one of these offences to show that they \ndid not intend or suspect that the relevant article would be used in connection with \na serious offence.  \n \n29. Clause 44(1) defines a relevant article for the purpose of these new offences, \nnamely:  \n• any document that may be used in conjunction with a 3D printer to \nproduce any part of a firearm ;  \n• encapsulators or pill presses used to produce tablets or capsules;  \n• a vehicle concealment that forms part of or is intended to form part of a \nvehicle that conceals people or things.  \n \n30. Manufacturers, modifiers, and suppliers profit from the supply of such articles that \ncould then be used by criminals to commit serious crime. These articles will \nchange over time as technology changes. Clause 4 4(3), (4) and (5)  will enable \nthe Secretary of State, by regulations, to amend this section so as to add to or \namend the list of relevant articles for the purposes of the offences in clause 43(1) \nand (2) . Clause 44(4) provides that relevant articles may only be added to the list \nif the Secretary of State considers that there is a significant risk of such an article \nbeing used in connection with any serious offence as set out in clause 43(1) and \n(2). \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n31. The Bill provides on its face for new offences criminalising the possession, \nimport ing, making, modifying, supplying, offering to supply of a relevant article in \ncircumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the relevant article \nwill be used in connection with any serious offence. It further contains a list of \nrelevant articles for the purpose of the offences. Given the dynamic and fast -\npaced nature of technological development and the readiness of criminals to \nexploit new opportunities to engage in crime, it is considered appropriate that the \nSecretary of State should have the ability to update the definition of a relevant \narticle for the purposes of the offences through secondary legislation. This \ndelegated power  would ensure that the list of specific articles used in serious \ncrime remains up to date  by enabl ing the government to amend the specified list. \nThis will allow the list to be kept up to date in response to the actions of individuals \nwho facilitate and commit serious crime and changes in criminal tactics.  \n \n32. Regular consultation will take place with all stakeholders including law \nenforcement agencies to identify tools or articles which enable serious crime to \ntake place which are not captured under existing legislation. Each article will be \nconsidered carefull y, examining the effects of listing new articles under this \nlegislation and the impact it would have on the public, specifically exploring the \neffects on those with protected characteristics, ensuring law abiding individuals \nand/or legitimate organisations  are not disproportionately affected.  \n \n \n8 \n Justification for the procedure  \n \n33. The regulation -making power in clause  44(3), (4) and (5)  is subject to the draft \naffirmative procedure. This is considered appropriate as this power will amend the \nscope of a criminal offence; the draft affirmative procedure is also appropriate \ngiven that this is a Henry VIII power. Parliament should have the opportunity to \ndebate and approve any new articles that w ould be added to this criminal offence \nbefore they take effect, given the impact that this could have on citizens.  \n \nClause 46(2) – New section 5B( 5) of the Serious Crime Act 2007: Power to \nspecify description of “responsible person”  \n \nPower conferred on:    Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercisable by:    Regulations made by statutory instrument  \n \nParliamentary procedure:    None  \n \nContext and purpose  \n \n34. By Part 1 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 (“the 2007 Act”) provides for Serious \nCrime Prevention Orders (“SCPOs”). SCPOs are civil preventative orders which \ncan impose tailored prohibitions, restrictions and requirements on a person for a \nperiod of up to five y ears to prevent or disrupt their involvement in serious crime. \nThere is an indicative list of “serious offences ” in Schedule 1 to the 2007 Act to \nwhich an SCPO can be applied. A “person” includes bodies corporate, \npartnerships and unincorporated associatio ns as well as individuals. The terms of \nan SCPO might relate to, for example: business and financial dealings, use of \npremises or items, provision of goods or services, employment of staff, \nassociation with individuals, means of communication or travel.  \n \n35. Clause 46(2) amends the provisions relating to SCPOs to allow for the court to \nexpressly attach an electronic monitoring requirement to an order. An electronic \nmonitoring requirement may be imposed to support the monitoring of an \nindividual’s compliance with other req uirements of the order (for example, where \nan exclusion/inclusion zone or a curfew are imposed). Electronic monitoring is \nundertaken using an electronic tag usually fitted to a person’s ankle.  \n \n36. The tag worn by the person transmits data to a monitoring centre where it is \nprocessed and stored. The monitoring centre, operated by a “responsible person”, \nreviews this data to see whether an individual being electronically monitored is \ncomplying with th e conditions of the SCPO. Where a person has failed to comply, \nthe responsible person provides information to the relevant authority, in this case \nthe police, responsible for the enforcement of the order.  \n \n37. The 2007 Act, as amended by clause 46(2), sets out further provision about \nelectronic monitoring requirements. New section 5B( 4) of the 2007 Act provides \nthat an SCPO which includes an electronic monitoring requirement must specify \nthe person who is responsible for the monitoring (“the responsible person”). New \nsection 5B( 5) of the 2007 Act provides that the responsible person must be of a \ndescription specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State. There is \nprecedent in legislation for this approac h. Similar enabling powers are contained \n \n9 \n in, for example, section 3AC(2) of the Bail Act 1976, section 215(3) of the Criminal \nJustice Act 2003 and section 37(7) of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021. The relevant \nstatutory instrument made under the first two of those powers is the Criminal \nJustice (Electronic Monitoring) (Responsible Person) Order 2017 (SI  2017/235).  \n \nJustification for the power  \n \n38. The regulations will provide a description of the person with whom the Secretary \nof State has made arrangements for providing the electronic monitoring services \nfor the purposes of the SCPO regime. Providing a description of the responsible \nperson is prope rly an administrative procedure. For that reason, the designation \nof the responsible person is considered an appropriate matter for secondary \nlegislation.  \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n39. The regulations made under new section 5B( 5) of the 2007 Act are not subject to \nany Parliamentary procedure (see section 89 of the 2007 Act as amended by \nclause 46(8)). The primary purpose of these regulations is simply to put into the \npublic domain the name of one or more persons contracted to provide electronic \nmonitoring services for the purposes of SCPOs. As set out above, the selection \nof the contractor(s) is properly an administrative matter for the executive. Given \nthis, no form of Parliamentary scrutiny is considered  necessary. This mirrors the \napproach taken in the analogous delegated powers in section 3AC(2) of the Bail \nAct 1976, section 215(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and section 37(7) of the \nDomestic Abuse Act 2021.  \n \nClause 46(2) – New section 5D(1) of the Serious Crime Act 2007: Duty to issue \ncode of practice relating to data from electronic monitoring  \n \nPower conferred on:    Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercisable by:    Statutory code of practice  \n \nParliamentary procedure:    None  \n \nContext and purpose  \n \n40. The amendments to the 2007 Act made by clause 46(2) include a power for the \ncourt to attach to a n SCPO an electronic monitoring requirement. Clause 46(2) \ninserts  a new section 5D into the 2007 Act which requires the Secretary of State \nto issue a code of practice on the processing of data gathered in the course of an \nelectronic monitoring requirement of an SCPO.  \n \n41. The processing of such data will be subject to the requirements in the UK General \nData Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018. The code of \npractice issued under new section 5D of the 2007 Act is intended to set out the \nappropriate tests and  safeguards for the processing of such data, in order to \nensure compliance with the data protection legislation. For example, the \ngovernment envisages that the code will set out the length of time for which data \nmay be retained and the circumstances in whi ch it may be permissible to share \ndata with the police to assist with crime detection. It is intended that the code will \n \n10 \n cover the collection, retention and sharing of personal data gathered under a \nrequirement that is imposed for the purpose of monitoring compliance with another \nrequirement.  \n \n42. Similar provision for a code of practice in respect of the processing of data from \nelectronic monitoring is included in section 215A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 \n(as inserted by the Crime and Courts Act 2013). Section 51 of the Domestic Abuse \nAct 2021 also makes similar provision in relation to Domestic Abuse Prevention \nOrders.  \n \nJustification for the power  \n \n43. The government considers that a code of practice is the most appropriate vehicle \nto set out expectations and responsibilities in relation to the processing of data \ngathered under the electronic monitoring requirement. There is a range of \nstatutory guidance issu ed each year and it is important that guidance can be \nupdated to keep pace with such changes and with operational good practice.  \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n44. Given the likely content and nature of the code, the fact that it will not define or \ncreate new legal responsibilities and that the processing of data must be in \naccordance with the requirements of data protection legislation, the government \ndoes not consider it is necessary for the code to be subject to any Parliamentary \nprocedure. This approach is consistent with the code provided for in section 215A \nof the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and section 51 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 . \n \nClause 4 9(3) - New paragraph 2(5)(j) of Schedule 1A of the Serious Crime Act \n2007: Power to add to the list of notification requirements  \n \nPower conferred on:    Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:    Regulations made by statutory instrument  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:    Draft affirmative procedure  \n \nContext and purpose  \n \n45. Clause 49(2) and (3)  inserts new section 15A and Schedule 1A into the Serious \nCrime Act 2007 which require a person subject to an SCPO to supply certain \ninformation to the police and keep such information up to date. Failure to do so \nwithout reasonable excuse, or knowingly supplying false information, is an offence \n(new  paragraph 3 of Schedule 1A). The relevant information is the person’s name \n(if the person uses one or more other names, each of those names); home \naddress (and the address of any other premises in the United Kingdom at which \nthe person regularly resides or  stays); telephone numbers and email addresses; \nusernames for a social media service including video games; identifying \ninformation of motor vehicles kept or routinely used by the person; specified \nfinancial information; specified information about identification documents; the \nname and address of each of the person’s employer (new paragraph 2(5)((a) to \n(i)). \n \n \n11 \n 46. Such information will assist law enforcement agencies in monitoring the person’s \ncompliance with the provisions of the SCPO and assessing the risk they may pose \nto the public. Additionally, standardising notification requirements helps to ensure \ngreater co nsistency in the way individuals are managed, including improving law \nenforcement agencies’ ability to share information with each other and manage \nSCPO cases proactively. New paragraph 2(5)(j) of Schedule 1A enables the \nSecretary of State, by regulations,  to specify further categories of information \nwhich persons subject to a n SCPO must notify to the police.  \n \nJustification for the power  \n \n47. The previous government published a public consultation1 on improving law \nenforcement agencies’ response to serious and organised crime. It sought views \non which personal details should be provided under the notification requirements \nfor those subject to an SCPO, including most of those listed above. Current \nnotification requirements can, but need not, include all the information listed above \nas part of the stipulations of an SCPO on a case -by-case basis.  \n \n48. Most consultation respondents agreed with the previous government’s proposal \nthat all SCPOs automatically include a prescribed set of notification requirements \nand agreed with all the suggested notifications requirements. Many respondents \nhighlighted that standardising notification requirements would create con sistency \nand enable effective monitoring by law enforcement agencies, whilst enabling the \ncourts to retain the flexibility to impose additional notification requirements where \nnecessary. Those respond ents who disagreed with the proposal suggested that \nno prescribed notifications should be imposed, with all requirements to be \nselected on the basis that they were necessary and appropriate to the offending \nhistory of the subject in each case.  \n \n49. There are notification regimes in Part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 in respect \nof sex offenders and Part 4 of the Counter -Terrorism Act 2008 (as amended by \nthe Counter -Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019) in respect of terrorism \noffenders. Both the se regimes require a wide range of information to be provided \nby those subject to the notification requirements. There is also a notification \nregime in Part 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021, in respect of a person who has \nabused a person aged 16 or over to  whom they are personally connected. The \ndiffering notification requirements reflect the different nature of these crimes. The \ngovernment has selected the notification requirements that are most appropriate \nfor individuals subject to SCPOs, reflecting the breadth of serious and organised \ncrime.  \n \n50. The government will continue to work with law enforcement and criminal justice \npartners to consider additional notification requirements. A power to add to the \nnotification requirement by regulations will enable the list to be amended in the \nlight of operationa l experience and as technology and criminal activity change.  \n \n51. This approach has i ts precedents. There are comparable powers in section \n83(5)(h) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and section 47(2)(h) of the Counter -\nTerrorism Act 2008.  \n \n \n1 Consultation document (accessible) - GOV.UK  \n \n12 \n Justification for the procedur e \n \n52. By virtue of section 89(3) of the 2007 Act, as substituted by clause 49(7) \nregulations made under new  paragraph 2(5)(j) of Schedule 1A are subject to the \naffirmative procedure. The affirmative procedure is considered appropriate given \nthat such regulations would enable the Secretary of State to add to the notification \nrequirements on persons subject to an SCPO, which would not have previously \nbeen considered by Parliament and which might be applied to individuals who \nhave not been convicted of any offence. Moreover, a failure to comply with any \nnotification requirement, including any additional notification requirement, would \nconstitute a criminal offence punishable on conviction with imprisonment of up to \nfive years. The analogous powers under the Sexual Of fences Act 2003 and the \nCounter -Terrorism Act 2008 are also subject to the affirmative procedure.  \n \nClause 53(1) – Power to make consequential amendments  \n \nPower conferred on:    Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:    Regulations made by statutory instrument  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:   Negative procedure  (if it does not amend primary \nlegislation), otherwise affirmative procedure  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n53. Clause 53(1) confers a power on the Secretary of State to make consequential \nprovision for the purposes of the Bill. Such provision may include repealing, \nrevoking or otherwise amending primary and secondary legislation. It therefore \nincludes a Henry VIII power.  \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n54. The powers conferred by this clause are wide, but they are limited by the fact that \nany amendments made under the regulation -making power must be \nconsequential on provisions made by or under the Bill. There are various \nprecedents for such provisions, includ ing section 84(2) of the Nationality and \nBorders Act 2022. The Bill already includes some changes to other enactments \nas a consequence of the substantive provisions in the Bill, but it is possible that \nnot all of the necessary consequential amendments hav e been identified in the \nBill's preparation. The Home Office considers it appropriate to enable \nconsequential amendments to be made by regulation in order to ensure that the \nchanges effected by this Bill can be effectively delivered, mitigating the risk of  \nundermining the effective operation of the provisions in the Bill if a provision were \nmissed.   \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n55. If regulations under this clause do not repeal, revoke or otherwise amend primary \nlegislation they will be subject to the negative procedure. If regulations under this \nclause amend or repeal provision in primary legislation, they will be subject to the \naffirmative procedure as befitting a Henry VIII power of this type. It is considered \n \n13 \n that this provides the appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny for the powers \nconferred by this clause.  \n \nClause 56(1) - Power to bring certain provisions of the Bill into force by \ncommencement regulations  \n \nPower conferred on:    Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:    Regulations made by statutory instrument  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:    None  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n56. Clause 56(1) contains a standard power for the Secretary of State to bring certain \nprovisions of the Bill into force by commencement regulations.  \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n57. Leaving provisions in the Bill to be brought into force by regulations will afford the \nnecessary flexibility to commence the provisions of the Bill at the appropriate time, \nhaving regard to the need to make any necessary secondary legislation, issue \nguidan ce, undertake appropriate training and put the necessary systems and \nprocedures in place, as the case may be.  \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n58. As is usual with commencement powers, regulations made under this clause are \nnot subject to any parliamentary procedure. The principle of the provisions to be \ncommenced will already have been considered by Parliament during the passage \nof the Bill. Commenc ement by regulations enables the provisions to be brought \ninto force at a convenient time.  \n \nClause 56(5) - Power to make transitional, transitory or saving provision s \n \nPower conferred on:    Secretary of State  \n \nPower exercised by:    Regulations made by statutory instrument  \n \nParliamentary Procedure:    None  \n \nContext and Purpose  \n \n59. Clause 56(5) confers on the Secretary of State  the power to make such \ntransitional, transitory or saving provisions as they consider appropriate in \nconnection with the coming into force of the provisions in the Bill, including the \npower to make different provision for different purposes or areas.  \n \nJustification for taking the power  \n \n60. This standard power ensures that the Secretary of State can provide a smooth \ncommencement of new legislation and transition between existing legislation and \n \n14 \n the Bill, without creating any undue difficulty or unfairness in making these \nchanges. There are numerous precedents for such a power.  \n \nJustification for the procedure  \n \n61. Such a power is commonly included as part of a Bill’s power to make \ncommencement regulations and such regulations are not usually subject to any \nparliamentary procedure on the grounds that Parliament has already approved \nthe principle of the provisions in the Bill by enacting them.",

HL Bill 54—I \nClause  6 \nLORD  MOYLAN \nTHE  EARL  OF EFFINGHAM \n3★_ Clause  6, page  3, line 17, leave  out subsection  (2) and insert— \n“(2) In subsection  (5), omit  from  “if” to end of subsection  (5).” \nMember's  explanatory  statement \nThis amendment  seeks  to remove  restrictions  or conditions  that could  impede  private  operators \nfrom applying  for service  permits,

explanatory  statement \nThis amendment  seeks  to ensure  clarity  on the type of data to be collected  and published  under \nClause  9, including  information  on public  subsidy  per journey  and service  performance  metrics. \nBARONESS  BRINTON \n6_ Clause  9, page  6, line 33, at end insert— \n“(11) The Secretary  of State  must,  no later  than  three  months  after  the day on which

purposes  of section  123D  of the Transport  Act 2000. \n(12) A statutory  instrument  containing  regulations  under  subsection  (11) may  not be \nmade  unless  a draft  of the instrument  has been  laid before  and approved  by a \nresolution  of each  House  of Parliament. ” \nMember's  explanatory  statement \nThis is a probing  amendment  to inquire  whether  the Secretary  of State  intends  to issue  the criteria \nfor the 'approved  persons'  role in the near future. \nClause  10 \nLORD  WOODLEY \n7★_ Clause  10, page  7, line 25, at end insert— \n“(3A) In section  123V(4)(d)

insert  “which  have  one or more \nstopping  places  in the area or areas” \nMember's  explanatory  statement \nThis amendment  brings  paragraph  9(3)(a)  of new Schedule  9A to the Transport  Act 2000  into \nline with paragraph  5(4)(a)  of that Schedule. 3 Bus Services  (No. 2) Bill [HL] \nClause  11 \nLORD  WOODLEY \n9★_ Clause  11, page  7, line 33, at end insert— \n“(a) either— ” \nLORD  WOODLEY \n10★_ Clause  11, page  8, line 2, at end insert  “, or \n(b) the contract  is awarded  to a local  authority  bus company. ” \nLORD  MOYLAN \nTHE  EARL  OF EFFINGHAM \n11★_ Clause  11, page  8, line 2, at end insert— \n“(1A) A franchising  authority  may  not make  a direct  award  of a public  service \ncontract  under  this regulation  until  it has conducted  an evaluation  of the \noperator’s  previous  performance  in meeting  accessibility  targets,  including \nspecific  improvements  to service  accessibility  for disabled  passengers. ” \nMember's  explanatory  statement \nThis amendment  ensures  that franchising  authorities  evaluate  the incumbent  operator’s  past \nperformance  on accessibility  metrics,  including  improvements  for disabled  passengers,  before \ngranting  a direct  award. \nAfter  Clause  11 \nLORD  GODDARD  OF STOCKPORT \n12_ After  Clause  11, insert  the following  new  Clause— \n“Reporting  on the implementation  of franchising \n(1) A franchising  authority  must  prepare  and publish  a report  no later  than  one year \nafter  the commencement  of bus operations  in a franchised  area. \n(2) The report  must  include— \n(a) an assessment  of the quality  of outcomes  resulting  from  the implementation \nof franchised  bus services,  including  reviews  of— \n(i) passenger  satisfaction, \n(ii) changes  in service  reliability  and coverage, \n(iii) accessibility  improvements,  and \n(iv) environmental  impacts, \n(b) a review  of the process  of establishing  and implementing  the franchising \nscheme,  including— Bus Services  (No. 2) Bill [HL] 4 \nchallenges  encountered, (i) \n(ii) costs  incurred,  and \n(iii) timelines  achieved, \n(c) a list of recommendations  for other  authorities  considering  the introduction \nof franchising  schemes,  based  on the authority’s  experience,  and \n(d) any other  matters  the franchising  authority  considers  relevant  to the \noperation  and outcomes  of the franchising  scheme. \n(3) The report  must  be made  publicly  available  and a copy  submitted  to the Secretary \nof State. \n(4) The Secretary  of State  may  issue  guidance  on the content  and format  of reports \nprepared  under  this section,  and franchising  authorities  must  have  regard  to this \nguidance. ” \nMember's  explanatory  statement \nThis amendment  requires  franchising  authorities  to publish  a report  a year after the commencement \nof operations  with recommendations  for other  authorities  considering  implementing  a franchised \nbus service. \nLORD  MOYLAN \nTHE  EARL  OF EFFINGHAM \n13★_ After  Clause  11, insert  the following  new  Clause— \n“Review  of direct  awards  of contracts \nThe Secretary  of State  must  conduct  an annual  review  of all direct  awards  made \nunder  section  11 and publish  a report  assessing  their  impact  on service  quality, \npassenger  satisfaction,  and market  competition. ” \nMember's  explanatory  statement \nThis amendment  ensures  ongoing  oversight  of direct  awards  by requiring  the Secretary  of State \nto review  and report  on their  effectiveness  annually. \nLORD  MOYLAN \nTHE  EARL  OF EFFINGHAM \n14★_ After  Clause  11, insert  the following  new  Clause— \n“Actions  in the event  of poor  performance  of a franchising  authority \n(1) The Secretary  of State  must,  by regulations,  define  the minimum  service  levels \nthat must  be met by franchising  authorities,  which  must  include,  but need  not be \nlimited  to— \n(a) the frequency,  reliability,  and accessibility  of bus services, \n(b) passenger  satisfaction  and accessibility,  including  for vulnerable  groups, \n(c) financial  viability  and sustainability  of bus services  within  the authority’s \narea,  and \n(d) environmental  and operational  standards  as set out in this Act. 5 Bus Services  (No. 2) Bill [HL] \n(2) If a franchising  authority  is found  not to meet  the defined  minimum  service  levels, \nthe Secretary  of State  must  undertake  a review  of the franchising  authority’s  ability \nto effectively  run bus services  within  its area. \n(3) Based  on a review  conducted  under  subsection  (2), the Secretary  of State  may— \n(a) initiate  corrective  actions  to address  service  deficiencies, \n(b) require  the franchising  authority  to enter  into a new  arrangement  with \nalternative  operators, \n(c) require  the franchising  authority  to implement  a remedial  plan  to improve \nservice  provision  within  a set period,  or \n(d) implement  a clawback  agreement  to secure  the return  of funding  previously \ngranted. \n(4) The Secretary  of State  must  publish  the findings  of any reviews  conducted  under \nsubsection  (2) and outline  any actions  taken  as a result  of the review,  including \nsteps  to ensure  the continued  provision  of high-quality  bus services  for \npassengers. ” \nMember's  explanatory  statement \nThis new clause  ensures  that the Secretary  of State  sets clear  service  standards,  holds  LTAs \naccountable  for meeting  those  standards,  and provides  a framework  for action  when  service  levels \nfall short,  including  the option  of a clawback  provision. \nLORD  MOYLAN \nTHE  EARL  OF EFFINGHAM \n15★_ After  Clause  11, insert  the following  new  Clause— \n“Requirement  for preliminary  case  for franchising \nBefore  commissioning  an assessment  under  section  123D(1)  of the Transport  Act \n2000  (audit),  local  transport  authorities  must  prepare  and publish  a preliminary \ncase setting  out— \n(a) the objectives  of franchising  in the area, \n(b) the expected  benefits  to passengers,  including  improvements  in service \nquality,  accessibility,  and coverage, \n(c) a cost-benefit  analysis  outlining  the anticipated  financial  implications,  and \n(d) an evaluation  of alternative  approaches,  including  enhanced  partnerships \nor other  mechanisms,  to ensure  franchising  represents  the best option. ” \nMember's  explanatory  statement \nThis amendment  seeks  to ensure  that LTAs  establish  a clear,  evidence-based  case for franchising \nbefore  initiating  an assessment,  with the intention  of safeguarding  public  funds  and ensuring  that \nfranchising  is pursued  only when  it is the most  viable  and beneficial  option. Bus Services  (No. 2) Bill [HL] 6 \nLORD  MOYLAN \nTHE  EARL  OF EFFINGHAM \n16★_ After  Clause  11, insert  the following  new  Clause— \n“Restriction  on repeated  franchising  assessments \n(1) Where  a local  transport  authority  decides  not to proceed  with  a franchising  scheme \nin light  of an assessment  carried  out under  section  123D(1)  of the Transport  Act \n2000  (audit),  the authority  must  not initiate  another  franchising  assessment  for \nthe same  area or a substantially  similar  area for a period  of five years  from  the \ndate  of that decision. \n(2) The prohibition  in subsection  (1) may  only  be waived  if— \n(a) there  is a material  change  in circumstances  that would  significantly  alter \nthe conclusions  of the previous  franchising  assessment,  and \n(b) the Secretary  of State  grants  approval  for a new  assessment,  based  on \nevidence  provided  by the local  transport  authority. ” \nMember's  explanatory  statement

Please note that names and addresses listed here will be provided to \nthe Bill’s promoter, but will be redacted in the version of the petition published on the \nParliament website.  \n \nBags of Taste Limited, London  \nMakhdoom Foods Limited,  London  \nPM Prime Fish, London  \nL&A Fishmonger, London  \nAmjad Choudry, Leyton  \nZafar Iqubal, London  \nAlicia Weston, London  \nFi Glover, London  \nChristine Jackson, London  \nAnamaria Rusu , London  \nBogdan Rusu , London  \nTrevor Daniel, London  \nCameron M artin, London  \nDoria Gonzalez , London  \nSandra Lousa da London  \nKathleen Kelliher , London  \nPhilip Irvine , London  \nLetticia Irvine, London  \nSam McMullen, London  \nTamara Tracz, London  \nMaxine Cupitt, London  \nSusanna Davies -Crook, London  \nMAR-MAR-002- Bags of Taste et al  \n \nJulia Jackson , London  \nTamara Stoll , London  \nMartin Phipps , London  \nSophie Gardiner , London  \nMariarosa Frasca, London  \n \nIn the box below, give a description of the petitioners. For example, “ We are the \nowners/tenants of the addresses above”; “ My company has offices at the address above”; \n“Our organisation represents the interests of…”; “ We are the parish council of…”.  \n \nBags of Taste is an organisation that supports people living in food poverty.  Many of \nthe people it supports shop in clearing  markets across London.   These markets allow \nthem to access low cost fresh produce , including fish , that is often towards end of life – \nwhich means that they can buy it cheaply and the food does not go to waste.  \nMakhdoom Foods, PM Prime Fish and L&A Fishmonger are fishmongers who primarily \nsource the fish they sell from Billingsgate market  \nThe remaining petitioners  are local residents who shop in the local clearing market, \nRidley Road, that is will be detrimentally affected. Much of the fish sold in the market is \nsourced in Billingsgate.  \n \n \n  \nMAR-MAR-002- Bags of Taste et al  \n \n2. Objections to the Bill  \nIn the box below, write your objections to the Bill and why your property or other interests are  \ndirectly and specially affected . Please number each paragraph.  \nOnly objections outlined in this petition can be presented when giving evidence to the \nCommittee. You will not be entitled to be heard by the Committee on new matters  not \nincluded in your written petition . \n \n \n1.  The current proposed closure of Billingsgate Market, with no replacement, is \npremature and we believe that it should not be permitted until a suitable \nreplacement is certain.  Our petition is on behalf of market traders from Ridley \nRoad Market in Hackney, London, whose business relies on  fish sourced from  \nBillingsgate market and who would close without it; and local residents who use \nthe local market and would also be affected.  \n2. We are concerned that the information on this closure with no replacement has \nnot been well disseminated and as such we believe that the number of \nobjections may be lower than they would otherwise be. Only 1 of the 6 \nfishmongers that I spoke to on Ridley Road knew that the replacement market in \nDagenham had been cancelled; they all believed that the market was moving to \nDagenham  and they would be fine.    \n3. In addition, the small, minority run businesses that are typical of these small \nfishmongers have limited language skills and on their own, may feel both \ndisempowered and incapable of engaging with Parliament in such a formal \nmanner.  As some put it “oh my God, what will we do?  We can do nothing” and \n“these big people already made the decision”  \n4. On speaking to 6 local fish sellers, one is part of a larger organisation that is \nintimately linked with Billingsgate; 2 source from wholesalers direct  or primarily \nsell frozen fish  and believe they would be OK.  However, 3 traders (notably, the \nsmallest), source their fish from Billingsgate where they visit 3x a week.   \n5. The 3 listed petitioner businesses say that they would close if there was no \ncentral fish market that they could access.  They employ staff (2 -3 each) and \neveryone would be made redundant.  Specifically, they said that they cannot \nafford to buy a whole container of fish, in Billingsgate they can shop with several \ndifferent distributors for smaller quantities , and compare prices to buy the best \nvalue fish that their customers demand .  If there was no central market they \nwould need to “spend the whole day driving around London” to get the same fish \nfrom different suppliers, as they would not be willing to deliver such small \nquantities.   One business owner said that this is the only business he knows, \nand would end up on benefits as he didn’t have any other options.  \n6. By forcing through this closure with no replacement there is an effective \nconcentration of power in the hands of those businesses who are large enough \nto command good relationships with wholesalers, and disadvantage those \nsmaller businesses who rely on a market to source produce.  \n7. Fish is a product uniquely suited to a market situation.  Because fish goes off, \nand through varying stages of freshness, a market enables the fish to find a \nsuitable market price and be sold before going to waste.  It is this low -priced fish \nthat ends up in markets in low income areas like Ridley Road.   A well functioning \nmarket reduces costs for all involved, in any commodity, and is absolutely critical \nMAR-MAR-002- Bags of Taste et al  \n \nfor perishable items, particularly fish.  \n8. People living in food poverty and on low incomes are often reliant on the low cost \nof local markets, particularly clearing markets like Ridley Road and others across \nLondon, to access cheap  and healthy  food.  Please remember that fish is one of \nthe healthiest foods around.  \n9. Particularly for ethnic minorities, fish is often a large part of their diet and so the \nimpact is disproportionate on ethnic minorities, who are usually also on lower \nincomes.  \n10. Local residents are concerned that there will not only be an impact on their ability \nto buy fish locally at a low price, but also that this will continue to undermine the \nonce -thriving Ridley Road market, and similar ones across London.  This will \ntherefore reduce access for the lowest income people to fresh and healthy food, \nnot only fish but the wide range that is on sale.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nMAR-MAR-002- Bags of Taste et al  \n \n3. What do you want to be done in response?  \nIn the box below, tell us what you think should be done in response to your objections  to the \nBill. You do not have to complete this box if you do not want to.  \nYou can include this information in your response to the previous section on ‘Objections to \nthe Bill’ if you prefer. Please number each paragraph.  \n \n1. Billingsgate Market is currently in an accessible site that is not so time \nconsuming for traders to visit.  It is something that businesses around London \nhave come to depend on, providing access to some of the healthiest food to be \nfound in London. Ideally  it should remain in this accessible location.  \n2. We believe that any legislation to allow the closure of the market should be \ndelayed till a viable , accessible  and alternative site has been found.  It is \npremature to close the market at this time when the Dagenham proposal has \nfallen through and livelihoods hang in the balance.",

This report sets out the Committee’s observations in relation to two private \nmembers’ Bills. It has long been, and remains, the Committee’s approach to \napply the same exacting standards of scrutiny to all bills, whether a government \nbill or a private member’s bill. We acknowledge however that those members \nof the House who sponsor private members’ bills, unlike ministers, do not \nhave the support of departmental officials and Parliamentary Counsel in \nthe preparation of their bills. Our comments on private members’ bills are \nframed in the light of that understanding.\n2\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n   REGULATED AND OTHER ACTIVITIES (MANDATORY \nREPORTING OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE) BILL [HL]\n2.   This private member’s Bill, which is expected to have its second reading on \n17 January, imposes a duty (subject to criminal sanction) on the providers \nof a range of education, healthcare and other settings to report to the local \nauthority where they know or reasonably suspect a child in their care to be \nsubject to sexual abuse. The activities which are the subject of the reporting \nduty are listed in the Schedule to the Bill. Clause 2(9) confers a power on \nthe Secretary of State by regulations to amend the Schedule by adding to \nthe activities, or varying or deleting an activity set out in the Schedule. \nDespite being a Henry VIII power,1  the Bill does not make provision for the \nregulations to be made by statutory instrument. There is also no parliamentary \nscrutiny attached to the power. Accordingly, we recommend that, if \nthe Bill proceeds to its further stages, it should be amended so that \nregulations under clause 2(9) are required to be made by statutory \ninstrument subject to the draft affirmative resolution procedure.\n1 A Henry VIII power is a power that allows amendment, repeal or other alteration of the effect of \nprimary legislation.\n3\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n    CROWN ESTATE (WALES) BILL [HL]\n3.   This private member’s Bill makes provision for the transfer to the \nWelsh Ministers, or a person nominated by them, of the Crown Estate \nCommissioners’ functions in Wales.\n4.   Clause 1 of the Bill inserts a new section 52A into the Wales Act 2017 which \nconfers a power on the Treasury to make a scheme transferring all the \nexisting Welsh functions of the Crown Estate Commissioners to the Welsh \nMinisters or a person nominated by the Welsh Ministers. The Treasury may \nonly make a transfer scheme with the agreement of the Welsh Ministers.\n5.   The provisions of section 52A are based on section 90B of the Scotland \nAct 1998 which they to a very large extent replicate, although in the latter \ncase the power relates to the transfer of the Crown Estate Commissioners’ \nexisting Scottish functions to the Scottish Ministers. In both cases, the \npower to make a transfer scheme is subject to parliamentary scrutiny, with \nthe draft affirmative resolution procedure applying. There is however one \nsignificant difference in the scrutiny provisions: whereas section 90B of the \nScotland Act 1998 provides for scrutiny only by both Houses of Parliament, \nsection 52A provides for scrutiny by both Houses and Senedd Cymru.\n6.   We do not consider that scrutiny of the power by Senedd Cymru is \nappropriate. The purpose of the transfer scheme is to set out the terms \non which a reserved matter, namely management of the Crown Estate in \nWales, should be devolved. In this context, the Bill enables the Treasury to \ninclude in the transfer scheme such provision as they consider necessary or \nexpedient in the interests of defence or national security, and also to include \nsuch provision as they consider necessary to ensure that the management \nof the Crown Estate in Wales does not conflict with other reserved maters, \nnamely the exploitation of oil or gas resources. Decisions relating to reserved \nmatters, and the terms on which they should be devolved, are in our view \nappropriately for the UK Government to make subject to scrutiny by the \nUK Parliament, and this is reflected in the fact that the power to make the \nscheme is conferred on the Treasury. It does not seem to us appropriate (or \nconsistent with previous practice) to make powers exercisable solely by UK \nMinisters subject to scrutiny by a devolved legislature.\n7.    Accordingly, we consider that, consistently with the approach for \nScotland under section 90B of the Scotland Act 1998, the powers \nconferred by section 52A of the Wales Act 2017 should be subject to \nscrutiny solely by both Houses of Parliament.\n4\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n    NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS (SECONDARY \nCLASS 1 CONTRIBUTIONS) BILL\n8.   This Bill contains no delegations of legislative power.\n FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  TO UKRAINE BILL\n9.   \nThis Money Bill contains no delegations of legislative power.\n5\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nAP PENDIX  1:    MEMBERS’ INTERESTS\n   Committee Members’ registered interests may be examined in the online Register \nof Lords’ Interests at https://www.parliament.uk/hlregister .

This report sets out the Committee’s observations in relation to a private \nmember’s Bill. It has long been, and remains, the Committee’s approach to \napply the same exacting standards of scrutiny to all bills, whether a government \nbill or a private member’s bill. We acknowledge however that those members \nof the House who sponsor private members’ bills, unlike ministers, do not \nhave the support of departmental officials and Parliamentary Counsel in \nthe preparation of their bills. Our comments on private members’ bills are \nframed in the light of that understanding.\n LITHIUM-ION BATTERY SAFETY BILL [HL]\n2. This private member’s Bill is intended to make provision for the safe storage, \nuse and disposal of lithium-ion batteries. It is due to have its second reading \non 6 September. There is no delegated powers memorandum as the Bill has \nnot been produced with the help of the Government.\n3. The Bill contains five regulation making powers each of which would appear \nto allow for the creation of criminal offences:\n• Two of the regulation making powers are explicit in conferring powers \nto create offences. In those cases, there is also a power to provide for \nthe imposition of civil sanctions (clauses 3 and 4).\n• In one case the power to create an offence appears to be a necessary \nconsequence of the power being conferred (clause 2).\n• In the other two cases, the nature of the regulation making power \nrequires an enforcement mechanism, but without making it explicit \nwhat the nature of the enforcement mechanism is. Such a mechanism \nwould have to be the creation of offences or the imposition of civil \nsanctions (clauses 5 and 6).\n4. All of the powers in the Bill are subject to the negative resolution procedure. \nIn our guidance to Departments1, we make it clear that the use of subordinate \nlegislation to create criminal offences should be treated as exceptional and \nthat it should only be done where there is a compelling justification. We \nalso consider that, where subordinate legislation is used to create criminal \noffences (or where it is used to impose civil sanctions), it should be subject to \nthe affirmative resolution procedure.\n5. In the circumstances, we consider that the Bill should be amended \nso that the regulation making powers conferred by it are all made \nsubject to the affirmative resolution procedure .\n6. Clause 5 requires the Secretary of State to make regulations regarding the \nsafety standards for conversion kits for use with micromobility vehicles that \nrun on lithium-ion batteries, and relating to the use of charging systems for \nelectric-powered micromobility vehicles. Clause 6 requires the Secretary of \n1 Paragraph 12 of the Guidance for Departments , December 2023.\n2\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nState to make regulations with respect to the disposal of lithium-ion batteries. \nIn both cases, although any requirements imposed by the regulations would \nneed to be enforced in order to be effective, nothing is said on the face of the \nBill as to what provision may be made in the regulations for the enforcement \nof their requirements. As noted above, it seems to us that the only possible \nenforcement mechanisms would be either the creation of criminal offences \nor the imposition of civil sanctions.\n7. We consider that clauses 5 and 6 are defective in failing to specify \nthe provision which is to be made in the regulations to enforce the \nrequirements imposed by them. We consider that the failure to \nspecify the enforcement mechanisms is particularly objectionable \nif the intention is that they should include the creation of criminal \noffences, given the constitutional significance of using subordinate \nlegislation in this way.\n ARBITRATION BILL [HL]\n8. There is nothing in this Bill which we would wish to draw to the attention of \nthe House.\n BANK RESOLUTION (RECAPITALISATION) BILL [HL]\n9. There is nothing in this Bill which we would wish to draw to the attention of \nthe House.\n BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY BILL\n10. There is nothing in this Money Bill which we would wish to draw to the \nattention of the House.\n COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY ASSOCIATION AND \nINTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (STATUS) \nBILL [HL]\n11. There is nothing in this Bill which we would wish to draw to the attention of \nthe House.\n CROWN ESTATE BILL [HL]\n12. This Bill contains no delegations of legislative power.\n HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL BILL\n13. This Bill contains no delegations of legislative power.\n LORDS SPIRITUAL (WOMEN) ACT 2015 (EXTENSION) BILL \n[HL]\n14.

Th\nis Bill amends the Railways Act 1993 (“the 1993 Act”) to remove the\npresumption in favour of private sector operation of franchised passenger\nservices. It is intended to facilitate the Government’s commitment tobring such train operations back into public ownership when the currentfranchise agreements end. The Bill contains two delegated powers, and theDepartment for Transport has provided a delegated powers memorandum(“the memorandum”).\n1 We draw the attention of the House to one of those\npowers.\n2. Th\ne Bill operates by generally prohibiting both the extension of existing\nprivate sector franchise agreements and the entering into of new suchagreements. However, the Bill also inserts two new sections into the 1993Act (sections 30A and 30B) which will allow the continuation of the existingprivate sector franchise arrangements, where the Secretary of State is thefranchising authority and is satisfied that it will not be reasonably practicableto provide passenger rail services by a public sector company when theexisting private sector franchise agreement comes to an end.\n3.\nSu\nbsection (4) of section 30A enables the Secretary of State by regulations\nto repeal that section and section 30B. Despite being a Henry VIII power,the regulations are subject only to the negative resolution procedure. Theuse of the negative resolution procedure is explained in paragraph 16 of thememorandum on the basis of the limited scope of the power and the fact thatthe power is intended only for the purpose of removing the provisions oncethey become obsolete.\n4.\nWe c\nonsider that the negative resolution procedure would be appropriate if\nthe power could only be exercised once sections 30A and 30B are spent (whichwill be the case when all the existing private sector franchising arrangementshave come to an end). However, that limitation does not appear in section30A(4) as drafted; instead it simply confers a power on the Secretary of Stateto repeal sections 30A and 30B, without limiting the circumstances in whichthe power may be exercised.\n5.\nAc\ncordingly, we recommend that the House seeks clarification from\nthe Minister as to:\n• whether the Government intend that the power to repeal sections30A and 30B should only be exercised once all the existing privatesector franchising arrangements have come to an end; and\n• why, if that is the intention, the power is not limited so that itmay only be exercised in those circumstances.\nWe also take the view that, in the absence of such a limitation, the affirmative resolution procedure should apply.\n1 Memorandum on the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill from the Department for \nTransport to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (5 September 2024): https://\nbills.parliament.uk/publications/56125/documents/5043\n2\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n PRODUCT REGULATION AND METROLOGY BILL [HL]\n6. T\nhis Bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 4 September. Its Second\nReading took place on 8 October.\n7. T\nhe Bill makes provision with respect to:\n• the marketing and use of products;\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether\nof goods or other things); and\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed.\n8. T\nhe Bill contains 14 clauses and one schedule.\n9. T\nhe Department for Business and Trade has provided a Delegated Powers\nMemorandum (“the Memorandum”)2 for the Bill.\n10. W\ne draw the following powers to the attention of the House.\n Clause 1, 2, 3 and 9—powers to make product regulations\n11. T\nhese clauses make provision with respect to the regulation of the marketing\nand use of all products3 (both consumer products and industrial products)\nin the UK save only for the “excluded products” listed in the Schedule tothe Bill. The excluded products include food, products of animal origin,aircraft, military equipment, medicines and medical devices.\n12.\nC\nlause 1 gives the Secretary of State power to make provision by regulations\nin relation to the marketing or use of products in the UK (“productregulations”), for the purpose of:\n• reducing or mitigating risks presented by products;\n• ensuring that products operate efficiently or effectively; or\n• ensuring that products designed for weighing or measuring operateaccurately.\n13.\nC\nlause 1 also gives the Secretary of State power to include in product\nregulations provision which corresponds, or is similar, to a provision of EUlaw\n4 for the purpose of reducing or mitigating the environmental impact of\nproducts.\n14. C\nlause 2 sets out matters in relation to which product regulations may impose\n“product requirements”. It also specifies categories of persons on whom suchrequirements may be imposed. Clause 2(7) allows product regulations toprovide that “product requirements” are to be treated as met if requirementsof EU law specified in those regulations are met.\n2 Memorandum on the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill [HL] from the Department for Business \nand Trade to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (30 August 2024): https://\nbills.parliament. uk/publications/56126/documents/5044\n3 “Product” is broadly defined in clause 1(5) as “a tangible item that results from a method of \nproduction”.\n4 The provision must correspond, or be similar, to a provision of “relevant EU law”, which means EU \nlaw that has the purpose of harmonising the conditions for the marketing or use of products in the EU.\n3\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n15. Clause 3 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of product \nregulations.\n16. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby product regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by Parts \n2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof Acts \n1868 to 1978 and section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights Act \n2015.\n17. The power to make product regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised:\n• to create or widen the scope of a criminal offence;\n• to create powers of entry, inspection or search;\n• to disapply or modify product regulations in cases of emergency;\n• to make provision about the disclosure of information by or to a relevant \nauthority5 carrying out functions under product regulations;\n• to make provision for a relevant authority to impose fees in respect of \ncosts incurred by the authority in carrying out its functions; or\n• to amend or repeal primary legislation.\n Skeleton legislation\n18. Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill are an example of what the Committee refers \nto as “skeleton legislation”. They contain almost no substance about the \nmarketing and use of products but instead give Ministers very broad powers \nwhich confer considerable discretion to legislate in that area by statutory \ninstrument. Almost all of the substance of the regulatory regime that is to \ngovern the marketing and use of products (including product safety) is to \nbe left to regulations. Even existing provision in primary legislation may \nbe replaced by provision in regulations. And the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied.\n19. The concern with “skeleton legislation” is its compatibility with the \nestablished principle that the principal aspects of policy should be on the face \nof a bill and only its detailed implementation left to delegated legislation. As \nwe stated in our Democracy Denied Report6: “Skeleton legislation signifies \nan exceptional shift in power from Parliament to the executive and entails \nthe Government, in effect, asking Parliament to pass primary legislation \nwhich is so insubstantial that it leaves the real operation of the legislation to \nbe decided by ministers”7.\n20. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee8 states that “Skeleton legislation should only be used in the most \nexceptional circumstances”. It adds that, if a Bill contains a skeleton clause, \n5 Under clause 3, product regulations may designate a person as a “relevant authority” with powers to \nenforce product regulations.\n6 12th Report  (Session 2021–22, HL Paper 106)\n7 At para 66.\n8 Guidance for Departments (December 2023): https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/42694/\ndocuments/212126/default/\n4\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nthe Delegated Powers Memorandum that a department must prepare to assist \nthe Committee with its scrutiny of the Bill should provide a full justification \nfor this approach, including why no other approach was reasonable to adopt \nand how the scope of the skeleton provision is constrained.\n21. We consider that the Memorandum fails to meet this requirement in respect \nof clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill.\n22. The first respect in which the Memorandum falls short is in its explanation \nof the existing legislation that could be amended and indeed replaced by \nregulations made under the powers in those clauses.\n23. Both the Memorandum and the Explanatory Notes to the Bill have little to \nsay about that existing legislation beyond high-level statements such as the \nfollowing:\n• the sale and supply of the “huge number” of products to which the Bill \napplies is “underpinned by an extensive body of law”9;\n• “the legal landscape is complex and technical, primarily set out in \nsecondary legislation and based on assimilated law”10 (the body of UK \ndomestic law derived originally from EU obligations); and\n• “The product regulatory framework in the UK covers most consumer \nproducts, for example toys and cosmetics, and a significant number \nof industrial products too, such as lifts and pressure equipment. The \noverwhelming majority of this legislation is assimilated law, transposed \ninto UK law while the UK was part of the EU and then assimilated \nfollowing the EU exit process”11.\n24. The Memorandum fails to identify the legislation in question or to explain \nwhat it does or its significance in policy terms. It even fails to explain in any \ndetail the content and significance in policy terms of the primary legislation \nthat could be replaced by regulations made under the Bill.\n25. This scarcity of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make. This gives rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nthe Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might be considered \nsufficiently important in policy terms to instead merit inclusion in the \nBill itself, where they would be subject to the much greater Parliamentary \nscrutiny afforded to primary legislation.\n26. This most obviously applies to those aspects of the existing regulatory \nregime that are contained in primary legislation that the Bill allows to be \nreplaced and repealed by product regulations12. The fact that the Bill allows \nthis merits a full explanation and a compelling justification. Yet although the \nMemorandum states that the repeal of that primary legislation by regulations \nis sufficiently important to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny, it offers no \nexplanation as to why matters that have hitherto been considered sufficiently \n9 At para 2 of the Memorandum.\n10 At para 13 of the Memorandum. “Assimilated law” includes (a) post-EU Exit UK versions of EU \nRegulations, and (b) UK statutory instruments made to give effect to EU obligations.\n11 At para 5 of the Explanatory Notes.\n12 Consumer Protection Act 1987, parts  2, 4 and 5; Gun Barrel Proof Acts 1868 to  1978 ; Consumer \nRights Act 2015, section 77  and schedule 5 .\n5\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in primary legislation should be \nleft to regulations at all.\n27.  It is also unclear whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nare currently contained in assimilated law (the body of UK domestic law \nderived originally from EU obligations) that might be considered sufficiently \nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in the Bill rather than in \nregulations.\n28. Even where that assimilated law is contained in subordinate legislation, \nthat is not by itself a good reason for any replacement provisions also to be \ncontained in subordinate legislation. This is a point that we have made in \nseveral previous reports, including our report on the Medicines and Medical \nDevices Bill13, where the Government sought to justify wide skeleton powers \non the basis that it was replacing one set of regulations with another. In that \ncase, we emphasised14 that the existing regulations had been made under the \nspecial power in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, the \npurpose of which was to allow EU law requirements to be implemented in \nUK domestic law by subordinate legislation - and that the power in section \n2(2) was subject to “a critical constraint”: it gave Ministers “power to make \nlaws giving effect to EU law–not simply power to make laws that Ministers \nmay wish to make”.\n29. In our report on the Energy Bill, we stated that:\n“the fact that provisions governing a subject area are currently contained \nin regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities \nAct 1972 does not by itself make it appropriate to use a regulation-\nmaking power to amend and extend the provisions in that subject area. \nInstead, the proposal to confer regulation-making powers needs to be \njustified on its own merits, particularly where, as in these cases, they are \nframework powers which are therefore capable of providing a very broad \nscope of regulation-making powers to the Secretary of State.”15\n30. The justification given in the Memorandum for the powers in clauses 1, 2, 3 \nand 9 is that:\n• aspects of the regulatory regime for products may need to be updated \nswiftly and frequently (for example “to respond to emerging hazards \nand risks, and developments in technology and scientific or technical \nunderstanding”16); and\n• the powers will give Ministers the flexibility to legislate to align UK law \nwith EU rules or to diverge from those rules.\n31. We consider that, whilst these may be reasonable arguments for the Bill \nconferring powers that allow some aspects of the regulatory regime for \nproducts to be provided for in delegated legislation, the Government have \nnot explained why the Bill goes so much further and instead provides for \nalmost all of the substance of that regulatory regime to be provided for by \nMinisters in regulations under the new powers, with little or nothing to be \nsettled under the fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions.\n13 19th Report  (Session 2019–21, HL Paper 109).\n14 At para 20.\n15 11th Report  (Session 2022–23, HL Paper 66), para 44.\n16 At para 38.\n6\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n32. The concern with powers of this kind is that they give Ministers maximum \nflexibility to choose the direction that the law will take. Ministers could, \nshould they so wish, use these powers as a mechanism for ensuring that \nUK domestic law on product regulation is completely aligned with EU law. \nAlternatively, they could use the powers to provide for UK domestic law to \ndiverge in significant respects from EU law. Whatever direction Ministers \nmay choose to take the law in - and however significant in policy terms that \nmay be–it is to be done by means of delegated legislation that will be subject \nonly to a relatively low level of parliamentary scrutiny.\n33. The Memorandum also fails to explain why  the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirements for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied - and it fails to say whether this \nrepresents a divergence from the existing regulatory regime. We note with \ninterest that at least one existing regulation-making power that the powers to \nmake product regulations are designed to replace (the power of the Secretary \nof State under section 11 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to make \n“safety regulations” with respect to goods) is, unlike the new powers, subject \nto consultation requirements.\n Power to set the ingredients of criminal offences\n34. Clause 3(9)(a) is particularly worthy of mention. It provides that product \nregulations may create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences for such \nthings as non-compliance with product regulations or obstruction of, or \nfailure to assist or co-operate with, a product safety inspector.\n35. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee states as follows17:\n“Where the ingredients of a criminal offence are to be set by delegated \nlegislation, the Committee would expect a compelling justification”.\nThe Memorandum explains18 why it considers the power in clause 3(9)(a) to \nbe sufficiently significant to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny but it fails \nto provide a justification for taking the power in the first place.\n36. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for products; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n Clauses 5, 6 and 9—powers to make metrology regulations\n37. Clause 5 gives the Secretary of State power to make “metrology regulations”, \nabout:\n17 Guidance for Departments (November 2021), para 12: https://committees.parliament.uk/\npublications/8225/documents/84262 /default/\n18 At para 54.\n7\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether \nof goods19 or other things), including how such units of measurement \nmust or may be calculated;\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed; and\n• the units of measurement that must or may be used to express such \nquantities.\n38. Metrology regulations may impose requirements in relation to matters \nincluding:\n• the marketing or packaging of goods;\n• the monitoring, assessment and verification of the quantities in which \ngoods are marketed and the units of measurement used to express such \nquantities; and\n• the retention of documents and information.\n39. Clause 6 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of metrology \nregulations. The provision made is identical in all material respects to that \nmade in clause 3 with respect to the enforcement of product regulations.\n40. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby metrology regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by \nParts 2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof \nActs 1868 to 1978, section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights \nAct 2015 and the Weights and Measures Act 1985.\n41. The power to make metrology regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised for purposes equivalent to those specified in \nparagraph 17 above with respect to the power to make product regulations.\n42. Clauses 5, 6 and 9 are another example of “skeleton legislation”. They \ncontain almost no substance about units of measurement and the quantities \nin which goods must or may be marketed. Instead, they confer very broad \npowers to make such provision by regulations.\n43. We consider that the concerns set out above with respect to the powers to \nmake product regulations apply equally to the powers to make metrology \nregulations, namely that:\n• almost all of the substance is left to regulations;\n• skeleton legislation is only justifiable in the most exceptional \ncircumstances and the Memorandum fails to provide the full \njustification that we expect where a Bill takes this approach;\n• the Memorandum fails to adequately explain the content—and \nsignificance in policy terms—of the existing legislation that could be \namended and indeed replaced by metrology regulations;\n• this lack of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make, giving rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the existing regulatory \n19 “Goods” are broadly defined in clause 5(4) as “tangible items (including packaging or labels)”.\n8\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nregime that the Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might \nbe considered sufficiently important to merit inclusion in the Bill;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace and repeal primary \nlegislation merits a full explanation and a compelling justification but \nthe Memorandum fails to provide this;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace all aspects of the \nexisting regulatory regime that are currently contained in assimilated \nlaw merits a full explanation and justification but the Memorandum \nfails to provide this;\n• the Government argues that aspects of the regulatory regime may need \nto be updated swiftly and frequently but they have not explained why \nthe Bill provides for almost all of the substance of that regime to be \nprovided for in regulations, with little or nothing to be settled under \nthe fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions;\n• the Memorandum fails to explain why the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or \nfor meaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied; and\n• the Memorandum fails to provide a justification for the power in clause \n6(9)(a) to create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences.\n44. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for metrology; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 5, 6 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n9\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n WATER (SPECIAL MEASURES) BILL [HL]\n45.

House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). Overview of the Bill  \n \n1. The European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill (\"the Bill\") has 25 clauses. A summary \nof, and background to, the Bill is provided below.  \n \n2. The Bill will provide the basis to amend the operation of the Windsor Framework, previously \nreferred to as the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, (\"the Northern Ireland Protocol\") \nincluded in the UK -EU Withdrawal Agreement (\"Withdrawal Agreement\") in th e domestic \nlaw of the UK. It will disapply elements of the Windsor Framework, and provide delegated \npowers to Ministers to make new law in connection with the Windsor Framework (including \nwhere provision ceases to have effect in the UK). Additionally, the Bill will provide delegated \npowers for Ministers to provide that other provisions of the Windsor Framework should \ncease to have effect in the UK. The Bill will also provide that any vote of the Northern Ireland \nAssembly in respect of continuing application  of the Windsor Framework will be on a cross -\ncommunity basis.  \n \nPolicy background  \n \n3. The people of the United Kingdom and Gibraltar decided by referendum on 23 June 2016 to \nleave the EU.  \n \n4. The terms of the UK’s departure from the EU were agreed and set out in the Withdrawal \nAgreement. This included the Northern Ireland Protocol setting out unique arrangements for \nNorthern Ireland. On 19 October 2019, the Government laid the Withdrawal Agreem ent and \nthe Political Declaration before Parliament; and on 23 January 2020 the European Union \n(Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 received Royal Assent. This enabled the United Kingdom \nto leave the European Union at 11pm (UK time) on 31 January 2020.  \n \n5. The Withdrawal Agreement provided for a time -limited transition period which ended at \n11pm (UK time) on 31 December 2020. During 2020 the United Kingdom engaged in \ndiscussions which culminated in the UK -EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, establishing \nthe terms of the UK’s future relationship with the EU. Alongside the Withdrawal Agreement, \nseveral elements of the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol were left to be discussed \nand agreed by the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee. An agreement regardi ng those \nissues was reached at the Joint Committee meeting on 17 December 2020. This included \nseveral grace periods and easements before the application of the full requirements of the \nNorthern Ireland Protocol, to avoid disruption for businesses and citiz ens. In addition \nsignificant work was undertaken by the Government to deliver the underpinning \narrangements for the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, including IT systems and a \nnew Trader Support Service. Following those preparations, the Norther n Ireland Protocol \ncame into force at the end of the transition period.  \n \n6. The Northern Ireland Protocol was intended to meet several overall policy objectives: to \nsafeguard the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all dimensions; to avoid a hard border on \nthe island of Ireland; to protect Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kin gdom and its \ninternal market; and to safeguard the EU’s Single Market. Its operation has continued to \nsupport trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland as intended. However, its \nrequirements —for full EU customs, sanitary and phytosanitary and other controls, as well as \n3 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). for Northern Ireland to apply EU rules in a variety of areas concerning goods —have led to a \nsignificant degree of disruption and burdens in practice.  \n \n7. In recognition of these concerns, the Government took some steps to avoid further disruption. \nThese included the extension of several easements in March 2021 and the application of \n\"standstill\" arrangements in September 2021, which continued to operate the  initial set of \ngrace periods and easements  with the aim  of maintaining a stable basis for trade and \nmovements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the light of the difficulties \nexperienced by businesses and citizens.   \n \n8. The Government looked to work with the EU to find joint solutions to the underlying \nchallenges posed by the Northern Ireland Protocol and propose ways forward to operate the \nNorthern Ireland Protocol sustainably. These discussions proceeded since January 2 021 but in \nFebruary 2022 the Co -Chairs of the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee took stock of the \ntalks that had taken place, and noted that agreement had not been possible at that point.  \n \n9. The Government thereupon introduced the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill 2022, which would \nhave disapplied portions of the Protocol in order to restore full UK lawmaking in Northern \nIreland and unfettered trade within the United Kingdom. It could also have permitted an \narrangement of mutual enforcement with the EU whereby each entity would enforce the rules \nof the other in respect of goods moving from one cust oms territory to the other. The 2022 Bill \nduly passed the House of Commons but was discontinued in th e House of Lords when the \nGovernment reached ‘The Windsor Framework’ with the EU. The Windsor Framework, while \nchanging the nomenclature of the Protocol to ‘The Windsor Framework’, did not alter the \nfundamentals of the Protocol, though it made the passage of some goods easier from GB to \nNorthern Ireland, particularly for supermarkets. However, its retention in Northern Ireland \nof EU law, an Irish Sea Border and the authority of the ECJ, did not ameliorate unionist \nopposition to the post -Brexit arrangements.  \n \n10. In January 2024 the Government published ‘Safeguarding the Union’, which outlined further \nadjustments but retained the application of EU law and customs code in Northern Ireland. In \nthe light of continuing concerns about the Windsor Framework, this Bill proposes more \nextensive changes to its operation and application in UK law.  \n \nThe Bill  \n \n11. The purpose of the Bill is to provide Ministers with the power to make changes to the \noperation of the Windsor Framework in domestic law ,  restore the cross -community \nimperative of  the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement  in respect of continuance of the Windsor \nFramework and to safeguard democracy, peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  \n \n12. The Bill makes certain provisions of the Windsor Framework \"excluded provision\". Where \nprovision is excluded, clause 3 provides that section 7A(2) of the European Union \n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 no longer applies to it, and the provision will not be applicable in \ndomestic law. Clause 4 provides that section 7C of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act \n2018 does not apply so far as it would produce an effect which is incompatible with any \nprovision made by or under the Bill.  \n \n4 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). 13. The Bill specifies which elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol are \"excluded provision\", \nparticularly Article 5(4) and Annex 2. The Bill in order to restore domestic law control \nexcludes elements of the Windsor Framework dealing with the movement of go ods and the \nregulation of goods in Northern Ireland; subsidy control; and the governance arrangements \nunder the Northern Ireland Protocol. Where provisions of the Bill create \"excluded provision\" \nthey are accompanied by a delegated power to make appropriat e new provision in domestic \nlaw. Powers are also provided in relation to VAT and excise.  \n \n14. The Bill also provides powers to reflect in domestic law the disapplication of additional \nelements of the Northern Ireland Protocol and to make new law as appropriate in connection \nwith this.   \nLegal background  \n \n15. The Windsor Framework is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement.  \n \n16. Section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"EUWA\") gives effect to Article 4 \nof the Withdrawal Agreement. Article 4 provides that the Withdrawal Agreement and the \nprovisions of EU law which it makes applicable are to have \"the same legal effec ts\" in the UK \nas those which they produce within the EU and its Member States. The effect of this is that the \nEU law applied under the Windsor Framework has supremacy in the UK’s legal order \n(meaning incompatible domestic legislation would be disapplied); EU law applied under the \nWindsor Framework will have direct effect in the UK (provided that the EU law conditions \nfor direct effect are satisfied); and EU law remedies will be available (including the \navailability of Francovich damages).  \n \n17. Section 7C supplements section 7A in ensuring the \"same legal effect\" of EU law in the UK \nthat it produces in the EU by directing courts to interpret relevant separation agreement law \nin accordance with the Withdrawal Agreement. \"Relevant separation agreem ent law\" is \ndefined in section 7C(3) and, amongst other things, includes anything which is domestic law \nby virtue of section 7A and the power to implement the Windsor Framework in section 8C, as \nwell as anything else so far as it is domestic law for the pu rpose of, or otherwise in scope of, \nthe Withdrawal Agreement.  \n \n18. Section 7A(2) works as a \"conduit pipe\" through which directly effective provisions of the \nWithdrawal Agreement (including the Windsor Framework) and EU law made applicable by \nit (e.g. regulations, decisions) flow into domestic law without the need for any  further \nimplementing legislation.  \n \n19. Although directives are not generally capable of direct application, to the extent they contain \ndirectly effective rights, those provisions are also capable of flowing through into domestic \nlaw. For provisions of directives and other EU law made applicable  by the Withdrawal \nAgreement that are not directly applicable, EUWA provides powers to implement them. \nSection 8C EUWA provides powers to implement the Windsor Framework and to \nsupplement the effect of section 7A in relation to the Windsor Framework.  \n \n20. The Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee (\"Joint Committee\") is responsible for the \nimplementation and application of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Windsor \nFramework. The Joint Committee can take binding decisions in respect of all matters for \n5 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). which the Withdrawal Agreement so provides and Joint Committee decisions have the same \nlegal effect as the Withdrawal Agreement pursuant to Article 166.2. Article 13.4 of the \nWindsor Framework gives the Joint Committee powers to take a decision to add a ne w EU act \nwhich is within the scope of the Windsor Framework to one of the   Windsor Framework’s \nAnnexes, provided that the act neither amends nor replaces an EU act made applicable by the \nWindsor Framework, following a procedure set out in Article 13.4.  \n \n21. Article 6.3 of the Withdrawal Agreement provides that references to provisions of EU law \nmade applicable by the Withdrawal Agreement include \"relevant Union acts supplementing \nor implementing those provisions\". This means that any implementing and delegate d acts \nenacted under the EU acts included in the annexes to the Northern Ireland Protocol apply to \nthe United Kingdom. By virtue of Article 13.3 of the Windsor Framework, EU law made \napplicable by the Windsor Framework is also to be read as including amend ments to the EU \nacts and replacements of such EU acts. It is not specified further how \"amendments and \nreplacements\" is to be understood. Where these new acts are directly applicable, they will \nalso be given effect by section 7A which in accordance with se ction 7A(1) gives effect to all \nrights, obligations etc \"from time to time created or arising by or under the Withdrawal \nAgreement\".  \n \n \nTerritorial extent  \n \n22. The territorial extent and application of the Bill is UK -wide. Clause 25 sets out the territorial \nextent of the Bill.  \n \nCommentary on provisions of Bill  \nClause 1: Overview of main provisions  \n \n23. Clause 1 summarises the effect of the Bill. It sets out that the Bill ends the effect of - i.e. \ndisapplies - specific areas of the Windsor Framework in domestic law; provides Ministers \nwith powers to disapply further areas of the Windsor Framework accordin g to specific \npurposes; provides Ministers with powers to make new law related to the Windsor \nFramework, putting in place suitable domestic arrangements where needed; and provides \nthat cross -community support in the Northern Ireland Assembly is required to  approve \ncontinued application of Articles 5 -10 of the Windsor Framework.  \n \n24. Subsection (1)(c) makes clear that where other enactments are subject to the Windsor \nFramework in domestic law, this ceases where the Windsor Framework is excluded under the \nBill - as for example with respect to Article VI of the Act of Union (Ireland) 180 0 and Act of \nUnion with Ireland 1800 and section 38 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act \n2020. \n \n6 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). Clause 2: Amendment of the European Union (Withdrawal) \nAct 2018  \n \n25. Clause 2 circumscribes the effect of section 7A of the EUWA by requiring  compatibility with \nthe Act of Union (Ireland) Act 1800, the Union with Ireland Act 1800, the territorial integrity \nof the United Kingdom, section 38 of the EUWA 2020 and the security interests of the United \nKingdom , which includes effective control of the United Kingdom’s borders. Clause 2 also \nprevents domestic legal effect being given to Article 2 of the Windsor Framework.  \n \nClause 3: Limitation of general implementation of the \nNorthern Ireland Protocol  \n \n26. Clause 3 allows the rest of the Bill to take effect. It removes the effect (in domestic law) of \n\"excluded\" provisions of the Windsor Framework and of the Withdrawal Agreement, which \nare currently given effect by section 7A of the EUWA.  \n \n27. Many of these provisions are EU law provisions that currently apply automatically in \ndomestic law, without any further enactment. This is because section 7A of the EUWA allows \nthem to retain their EU law characteristics of direct application, direct effect  and supremacy.  \n \n28. Subsections (1) and (2) address section 7A of the EUWA to provide clarity in domestic law on \nthe disapplication of the \"excluded\" provision of the Windsor Framework and Withdrawal \nAgreement, allowing new domestic law to operate clearly.  \n \n29. Subsection (3) amends section 7A of the EUWA to reflect this.  \n \nClause 4: Other limitations in interpretation of law  \n \n30. Clause 4 has ancillary function to clause 3, limiting the relevant part of the EUWA that would \notherwise require domestic courts to interpret domestic law in light of relevant separation \nagreement law (i.e. the Withdrawal Agreement, EEA -EFTA Separation Agr eement and Swiss \nCitizens’ Rights Agreement). Without this clause, courts could be placed in a contradictory \nposition whereby they would be required to interpret domestic law in light of EU law that no \nlonger applies in the UK.  \n \n31. Subsection (1) provides for the necessary change to section 7C of the EUWA, and subsection \n(2) amends the EUWA to reflect this.  \n \nClause 5: Annex 2 of the Windsor Framework: excluded \nprovision  \n \n32. Clause 5 makes Article 5(4) and Annex 2 of the Windsor Framework excluded provisions so \nas to address the application in Northern Ireland of EU laws.  \n7 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18).  \nClause 6: Movement of goods (including customs): excluded \nProtocol provision  \n \n33. Clause 6 provides for a default exclusion for both UK and non -EU destined goods moving \nbetween Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The result is that these goods do not face the \nrequirements placed on them under the Windsor Framework. This clause, along wi th clauses \n7 and 8, provides the basis for the Government to administer a different regime for the \nmovement of goods.  \n \n34. Clause 6 disapplies parts of Article 5.1 and Articles 5.2 and 5.3 of the Windsor Framework. \nThese provisions set out that customs duty would only be due on goods entering Northern \nIreland that were \"at risk\" of entering the EU. The clause removes the effect of these in \ndomestic law as this \"at risk\" test will be replaced by an alternative model as per paragraph 3 6 \nabove. Clause 6 when taken with Clause 5, which disapplies Article 5(4) and Annex 2 of the \nWindsor Framework, removes customs requirements, tarif fs, and regulatory requirements on \ninternal goods movements within the United Kingdom.   \n \nClause 7: Movement of goods: new law about matters other \nthan customs  \n \n35. Clause 7 allows a Minister of the Crown to make regulations in relation to clause 6. This \nclause enables a Minister to make provision for UK and EU destined goods to be \ndistinguished, for example by providing for different requirements as to the checks and  \ncontrols that will apply in respective cases.  \n \n36. Subsection (1) provides that a Minister of the Crown may, by regulations, make appropriate \nprovision in connection with any provision of the Northern Ireland Protocol to which clause 6 \nrelates.  \n \n37. Subsection (2) clarifies that subsection (1) cannot be used to make provision about customs \nmatters, which are instead covered by clause 8.  \n \n38. Subsection (3) provides clarity that regulations made under subsection (1) may include \nprovision for appropriate arrangements to apply to goods, regardless of destination. For \nexample, this would enable the continued application of pre -EU Exit controls on the \nmovement of live animals. It would also ensure that a ‘trusted trader’ regime in connection \nwith mutual enforcement or alternative arrangements could be accompanied by appropriate \nunderpinnings and restrictions to allow it to function effectively and a void abuse of the \nscheme.  \n \nClause 8: Customs matters: new law  \n \n39. Clause 8 allows the Treasury and HMRC to bring forward legislation in relation to customs \nmatters including duties and the administration and enforcement of customs. This is in line \n8 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). with standard legislative procedure in relation to legislating for the collection and \nadministration of duties.  \n \n40. Subsection (2) provides clarity regarding elements that such regulations could include. As \nwith clause 7, this provides the means to establish the underpinnings of any future mutual \nenforcement regime, and accompanying ‘trusted trader’ scheme, and enable i t to function \neffectively.  \n \nClause 9: Regulation of goods  \n \n41. Clause 9 provides for a Minister to make such regulations as are necessary to restore United \nKingdom control over goods produced, traded and moving to and from the UK. Such would \ninclude manufactured goods, medicines and agri -food goods. This will change the present \narrangements whereby goods are required to comply with the relevant EU requirements that \nare listed in Annex 2 of the Windsor Framework   - meaning that goods that only meet UK \nrequirements and not the applicable EU requirements cannot currently be placed on the \nmarket i n Northern Ireland.  \n \n \nClause 10: Meaning of \"regulation of goods\"  \n \n42. Clause 10 provides definitions in relation to the regulatory regime established in this Bill.  \n \n43. Subsection (1) clarifies that \"regulation of goods\" in this Bill means regulation of making \ngoods available on the market; putting goods into service; production of goods (whether by \nmanufacture or any other process); and use and import of goods. This subs ection also makes \nclear that regulation of goods includes any matter relevant to the regulation of goods \nincluding matters that occur before or after goods are made available on the market, put into \nservice, or produced.  \n \n44. Subsection (2) sets out a further non -exhaustive list of what these regulatory matters may \ninclude.  \n \n45. Subsection (3) makes clear that in the case of placing goods on the market or putting goods \ninto service, those matters may also include production of goods (whether by manufacture or \nany other process).  \n \n46. Subsection (4) provides that a Minister of the Crown may, by regulations, make provision \nabout the meaning of regulation of goods in this Bill, including changing the effect of other \nprovisions in this section.  \n \nClause 11: Subsidy control  \n \n47. Clause 11 provides the basis for a single UK -wide subsidy control policy, rather than two \nseparate regimes as currently provided for under the Windsor Framework. The clause \nprovides clarity in domestic law on the disapplication of Article 10 (including the  obligation \n9 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). to notify measures currently in scope of the Northern Ireland Protocol to the European \nCommission).  \n \n48. Subsection (1) excludes Article 10 and Annexes 5 and 6 of the Windsor Framework from the \nprovisions given effect in domestic law under section 7A(2) of the EUWA.  \n \n49. Article 10 of the   Windsor Framework applies EU State aid rules to the UK with regard to \nmeasures which affect trade in goods and wholesale electricity between Northern Ireland and \nthe EU. Annex 5 of the Northern Ireland Protocol lists the substantive State aid rules which \napply as part of the application of Article 10, and Annex 6 provides the procedures by which \nArticle 10.2 is applied.  \n \n50. Subsection (2) of this clause makes consequential amendments to the Subsidy Control Act \n2022. Section 42(8)(d) of the Subsidy Control Act ensures that the calculation of Minimal \nFinancial Assistance (\"MFA\") and Services of Public Economic Interest (\"SPEI\")  Assistance \nincludes De Minimis  aid given under Article 10 the   Windsor Framework. The disapplication \nof Article 10 means that MFA and SPEI Assistance can exclude the calculation of De Minimis  \naid given under Article 10 of the   Windsor Framework. Subsectio n (2) of this clause therefore \namends Section 42(8)(d) of the Subsidy Control Act to confirm that this calculation is only \nnecessary until Article 10 is disapplied and this Bill comes into force.  \n \n51. Subsection (2) of this clause also amends section 48(3) of the Subsidy Control Act so it ceases \nto disapply UK subsidy control rules where the State aid rules apply by virtue of Article 10 of \nthe  Windsor Framework. This will extend UK subsidy control rules to Northern Ireland once \nArticle 10 is disapplied and this Bill comes into force.  \n \n52. Subsection (3) of this clause provides that a Minister of the Crown may, by regulations, make \nappropriate provision in connection with any provision of the Northern Ireland Protocol to \nwhich this clause relates.  \n \nClause 12: Implementation, application, supervision and \nenforcement of the Windsor Framework   \n \n53. Clause 12 disapplies the effect in domestic law of provisions relating to implementation and \nenforcement of the   Windsor Framework.  \n \n54. Subsection (1) sets out that any provision of the   Windsor Framework or Withdrawal \nAgreement is excluded so far as it confers jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European \nUnion (\"CJEU\") in relation to the   Windsor Framework or related provision of the Withdrawal \nAgreement. That is the case whether the CJEU jurisdiction relates to excluded provisions or \nany other matter.  \n \n55. Subsection (2) sets out that Article 12.2 and 12.3 of the   Windsor Framework are \"excluded \nprovision\".  \n \n56. Subsection (3) sets out that other provision relating to the implementation, application, \nsupervision and enforcement of the   Windsor Framework is excluded under clause 13.  \n \n10 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). 57. Subsection (4) provides that a Minister of the Crown may, by regulations, make appropriate \nprovision in connection with any provision of the   Windsor Framework to which this clause \nrelates.  \n \nClause 13: Provision of the Windsor Framework etc applying \nto other exclusions  \n \n58. Clause 13 disapplies other ancillary provisions in the Windsor Framework and Withdrawal \nAgreement, insofar as they might otherwise apply in relation to the provisions of the Windsor \nFramework and Withdrawal Agreement that are disapplied by this Bill.  \n \n59. Subsection (1) makes clear that, in domestic law, other provision of the Windsor Framework \nand Withdrawal Agreement does not apply, insofar as they otherwise would apply in \nrelation to a provision that has been disapplied by this Bill.  \n \n60. Subsection (2) then provides examples of the ancillary provision that is covered by subsection \n(1). For example, this includes parts of the Withdrawal Agreement that govern how \nreferences to EU law in the Windsor Framework should be read.  \n \n61. Subsection (3) sets out that the matters which may be disapplied by this clause, so far as they \napply in relation to other provision of the Windsor Framework that has been disapplied, this \nincludes the responsibility of the authorities of the UK to impleme nt EU law and the \nrequirement that such provision is to be interpreted in conformity with the methods and \ngeneral principles of EU law and relevant EU case law.  \n \n62. Subsection (4) provides that a Minister of the Crown may, by regulations, make appropriate \nprovision related to the aspects of the Windsor Framework and other parts of the Withdrawal \nAgreement that are disapplied by this clause.  \n \nClause 14: Changes to, and exceptions from, excluded \nprovision  \n \n63. Clause 14 describes how Ministers may change which elements of the Windsor Framework or \nthe Withdrawal Agreement are \"excluded provision\".  \n \n64. Subsection (1) defines the purposes for which Ministers may disapply further areas of the \nWindsor Framework. These purposes include ensuring the effective flow of trade between \nNorthern Ireland and another part of the United Kingdom; safeguarding animal, p lant or \nhuman welfare or health; and lessening, eliminating or avoiding difference between tax or \ncustoms duties in Northern Ireland and Great Britain (amongst other purposes). Subsections \n(1)(i)(i) and (1)(i)(ii) make clear that the international obligati ons included in subsection (1)(i) \ndo not include the Windsor Framework or the Withdrawal Agreement.  \n \n65. Subsection (2) provides that a Minister of the Crown may, by regulations, make provision \nthat amends the extent of \"excluded provision\". Subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b) make clear that \nthis power can be used either to exclude additional provisions or to incr ease the extent to \nwhich an already -excluded provision is excluded, whilst subsections (2)(c) makes clear that \n11 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). this power can be used to decrease the extent to which an already -excluded provision is \nexcluded.  \n \n66. Subsection (3) provides a limit to the power in subsection (2). It states that the power may not \nbe exercised to provide for Article 2, Article 3, or Article 11 of the Windsor Framework to \nbecome excluded provision to any extent.  \n \nClause 15: Additional excluded provision: new law  \n \n67. Clause 15 describes how Ministers may make new law in connection with provisions of the \nWindsor Framework or Withdrawal Agreement which are additional \"excluded provision\" by \nvirtue of the powers in clause 14.  \n \n68. Subsection (1) provides that a Minister of the Crown may, by regulations, make appropriate \nprovision in relation to parts of the Windsor Framework or Withdrawal Agreement that are \nmade \"excluded provision\" using the powers in clause 14.  \n \n69. Subsection (2) clarifies that the power to make regulations contained in this clause is not \nlimited in any way by the other powers in the Bill.  \n \n70. Subsection (3) defines \"additional excluded provision\" as provisions made excluded under \nthe powers in clause 1 4(2)(a) to 1 4(2)(c). This includes where that exclusion is subsequently \nprecluded to a greater or lesser extent.  \n \nClause 16: Value added tax, excise duties and other taxes: \nnew law  \n \n71. Clause 16 provides that the Treasury may make provision related to VAT and excise law, and \nany other taxes, which they consider appropriate in connection with the Windsor Framework. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, implementing VAT and excise measures  UK-wide that \nmight otherwise not be permitted in Northern Ireland under the Windsor Framework. As \nsuch, it provides Ministers with the ability to ensure that VAT, excise and other tax policy can \nbe applied throughout the entirety of the UK where appropria te, including Northern Ireland.  \n \n72. Subsection (1) provides the Treasury with the power to make provision about VAT, excise \nduty and other taxes in relation to the Windsor Framework. It makes clear that this can \ninclude changes that would impose or vary the incidence of VAT, excise duty, and  any other \ntax. \n \n73. Subsection (2) clarifies that the Treasury may use this power in particular where doing so is \nnecessary to lessen, eliminate, or avoid differences in VAT, excise duties or other taxes \nbetween Northern Ireland and Great Britain.    \n \nClause 17: Other Ministerial powers  \n \n12 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). 74. Clause 17 clarifies the relationship between powers provided by this Bill and those arising \notherwise, including by virtue of the Royal Prerogative.  \n \n75. Subsection (1) provides that Ministers can engage in conduct (i.e. sub -legislative activity, such \nas producing guidance) relevant to the Windsor Framework if they consider it appropriate in \nconnection with one or more of the purposes of this Bill.  \n \n76. Subsection (2) clarifies that this Bill does not affect powers otherwise provided to Ministers of \nthe Crown, including any power to make subordinate legislation or powers under the Royal \nPrerogative.  \n \nClause 18: Role of the European Court in court and tribunal \nproceedings  \n \n77. Clause 18 makes provision regarding the effect in domestic law of rulings of the CJEU.  \n \n78. Subsection (1) establishes the scope of clause 18, outlining that it applies to proceedings so far \nas they relate to: the Windsor Framework; related provision of the Withdrawal Agreement; or \ndomestic law relating to the Windsor Framework or related provisi on of the Withdrawal \nAgreement.  \n \n79. Subsection (2) provides that domestic courts and tribunals are not required in domestic law to \nfollow the jurisprudence of the CJEU, and cannot refer cases to it in relation to the Windsor \nFramework or related provision of the Withdrawal Agreement.  \n \n80. Subsection (3) provides that a Minister of the Crown may, by regulations, make appropriate \nprovision related to subsection (2).  \n \nClause 19: Continued application of Articles 5  to 10 of the \nWindsor Framework   \n \n81. Clause 19 provides that any democratic consent vote on the continued application of Articles \n5 to 10 of the Windsor Framework requires cross -community consent in the Northern Ireland \nAssembly.   \n \nClause 20: Preparatory expenditure  \n \n82. Clause 20 provides that Ministers of the Crown, government departments, or devolved \nauthorities may properly incur expenditure in preparation for action undertaken under this \nBill, for the making of statutory instruments under this Bill, or under other Act s or statutory \ninstruments as modified by or under this Bill.  \n \nClause 21: Regulations  \n \n13 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). 83. Clause 21 sets out the general scope and nature of the powers contained in the Bill.  \n \n84. Subsection (1) confirms that regulations under this Bill can make any provision that can be \nmade by an Act of Parliament; this includes amending this Bill or making retrospective \nprovision.  \n \n85. Subsection (2) gives further non -exhaustive examples of what regulations under this Bill may \ndo, including making provision notwithstanding that provision’s incompatibility with the \nWindsor Framework or any other part of the Withdrawal Agreement.  \n \n86. Subsection (3) sets out that regulations under this Bill which are considered to be appropriate \nin relation to an exclusion, continue to be exercisable if said exclusion is modified or removed \nusing the powers under clause 14(2)(b -d). \n \n87. Subsection (4) provides that regulations brought forward under the powers in this Bill are \nnever to be treated as hybrid instruments.  \n \n88. Subsection (5) provides that a Minister of the Crown may, by regulations, make the other \npowers under this Bill exercisable exclusively, concurrently or jointly with Devolved \nAdministrations, and may provide for Devolved Administration scrutiny of said reg ulations.  \n \nClause 22: Making regulations under this Act: general \nprovisions  \n \n89. Clause 22 sets out the process and parliamentary procedure for the regulations made under \nthe Bill.  \n \n90. Subsections (1) and (2) set out that the processes in clause 22 apply to regulations made under \nthe Bill, excluding tax or customs regulations.  \n \n91. Subsection (3) sets out that regulations under the Bill are to be made by statutory instrument.  \n \n92. Subsection (4) sets out that statutory instruments are subject to the negative procedure (i.e. \nsubject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament) except \nwhere they amend an Act of Parliament or make retrospective provision.  \n \n93. Subsection (5) sets out that where a statutory instrument amends an Act of Parliament or \nmakes retrospective provision, it is subject to the draft affirmative procedure unless the \ninstrument contains a declaration from the Minister that urgency requires it  be subject to the \nmade affirmative procedure.  \n \n94. Subsection (6) provides that a draft affirmative statutory instrument can only be made once a \ndraft of the instrument has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of both Houses of \nParliament.  \n \n95. Subsection (7) provides that once made, a made affirmative statutory instrument must be laid \nbefore Parliament and it will cease to have effect after 28 days (starting with the day on which \nthe instrument is made) unless within those 28 days the instrument is approved by a \nresolution of each House.  \n14 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18).  \n96. Subsection (8) states that in calculating the above 28 day period, no account is to be taken of \nperiods when Parliament is dissolved, prorogued, or when either House is adjourned for \nmore than four days.  \n \n97. Subsection (9) sets out that, if regulations cease to have effect as a result of not receiving \napproval by a resolution of each House within 28 days under subsection (7)(b), that does not \naffect the validity of anything previously done under the regulation s or prevent the making \nof new regulations.  \n \nClause 23: Regulations relating to tax or customs matters  \n \n98. Clause 23 relates to tax or customs regulations under this Bill.  \n \n99. Subsection (1) confirms only the Treasury may take forward regulations relating to tax using \na relevant power in this Bill.  \n \n100. Subsection (2) confirms only the Treasury or HMRC may take forward regulations relating to \ncustoms using a relevant power in this Bill.  \n \n101. Subsection (3) confirms that tax or customs regulations are to be made by statutory \ninstrument.  \n \n102. Subsection (4) sets out that statutory instruments are subject to the negative procedure before \nthe House of Commons only (i.e. subject to an annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the \nHouse of Commons), except where they amend an Act of Parliament or m ake retrospective \nprovision.  \n \n103. Subsection (5) sets out that where a statutory instrument amends an Act of Parliament or \nmakes retrospective provision, it is subject to the draft affirmative procedure before the \nHouse of Commons only, unless the instrument contains a declaration from the  Minister that \nurgency requires it be subject to the made affirmative procedure.  \n \n104. Subsection (6) sets out that where a statutory instrument is subject to the draft affirmative \nprocedure before the House of Commons only, it is only to be made once a draft of the \ninstrument is laid before, and approved by a resolution of, the House of Com mons.  \n \n105. Subsection (7) provides that where a statutory instrument is subject to the made affirmative \nprocedure before the House of Commons only, it must, once made, then be laid before the \nHouse of Commons and it will cease to have effect after 28 days (starting o n the day the \ninstrument is made) unless within those 28 days the instrument is approved by a resolution \nof the House of Commons.  \n \n106. Subsection (8) states that in calculating the above 28 day period, no account is to be taken of \nperiods when Parliament is dissolved, prorogued, or when the House of Commons is \nadjourned for more than four days.  \n \n107. Subsection (9) sets out that where regulations cease to have effect as a result of not receiving \napproval by a resolution of the House of Commons within 28 days under subsection (7)(b), \n15 \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the European Union (Withdrawal Arrangements) Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons on 16 October  2024 (Bill 18). this does not affect the validity of anything previously done under the regulations or prevent \nthe making of new regulations.  \n \n108. Subsection (10) provides that the relevant parts of this clause does not apply to regulations \nmade in combination with regulations made using powers under other legislation where that \nlegislation requires the statutory instrument containing those regulatio ns to be made under \nthe draft affirmative procedure and approved by a resolution of either the House of \nCommons or both Houses of Parliament.  \n \n109. Subsection (11) provides that a relevant power is any power in the Bill other than clauses 7 \nand 13 which are designed to relate to customs and tax respectively. Subsection (11) also \ndefines tax or customs provision and tax or customs regulations.  \n \nClause 24: Interpretation  \n \n110. Clause 24 provides the definition of relevant terms in the Bill, including by cross reference to \ntheir definition in other pieces of legislation.  \n \n111. Subsection (1) lists and defines a number of key terms in the Bill.  \n \n112. Subsection (2) defines what is meant by references in the Bill to provision of the Windsor \nFramework that does not have effect in the United Kingdom; and to an enactment being \naffected by provision of the Windsor Framework.  \n \nClause 25: Extent, commencement and short title  \n \n113. Clause 25 makes a number of final provisions in the Bill.  \n \n114. Subsection (1) provides that the Bill extends to the legal jurisdictions of England and Wales, \nScotland and Northern Ireland.  \n \n115.

This report sets out the Committee’s observations in relation to two private \nmembers’ Bills. It has long been, and remains, the Committee’s approach to \napply the same exacting standards of scrutiny to all bills, whether a government \nbill or a private member’s bill. We acknowledge however that those members \nof the House who sponsor private members’ bills, unlike ministers, do not \nhave the support of departmental officials and Parliamentary Counsel in \nthe preparation of their bills. Our comments on private members’ bills are \nframed in the light of that understanding.\n2\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n   REGULATED AND OTHER ACTIVITIES (MANDATORY \nREPORTING OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE) BILL [HL]\n2.   This private member’s Bill, which is expected to have its second reading on \n17 January, imposes a duty (subject to criminal sanction) on the providers \nof a range of education, healthcare and other settings to report to the local \nauthority where they know or reasonably suspect a child in their care to be \nsubject to sexual abuse. The activities which are the subject of the reporting \nduty are listed in the Schedule to the Bill. Clause 2(9) confers a power on \nthe Secretary of State by regulations to amend the Schedule by adding to \nthe activities, or varying or deleting an activity set out in the Schedule. \nDespite being a Henry VIII power,1  the Bill does not make provision for the \nregulations to be made by statutory instrument. There is also no parliamentary \nscrutiny attached to the power. Accordingly, we recommend that, if \nthe Bill proceeds to its further stages, it should be amended so that \nregulations under clause 2(9) are required to be made by statutory \ninstrument subject to the draft affirmative resolution procedure.\n1 A Henry VIII power is a power that allows amendment, repeal or other alteration of the effect of \nprimary legislation.\n3\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n    CROWN ESTATE (WALES) BILL [HL]\n3.   This private member’s Bill makes provision for the transfer to the \nWelsh Ministers, or a person nominated by them, of the Crown Estate \nCommissioners’ functions in Wales.\n4.   Clause 1 of the Bill inserts a new section 52A into the Wales Act 2017 which \nconfers a power on the Treasury to make a scheme transferring all the \nexisting Welsh functions of the Crown Estate Commissioners to the Welsh \nMinisters or a person nominated by the Welsh Ministers. The Treasury may \nonly make a transfer scheme with the agreement of the Welsh Ministers.\n5.   The provisions of section 52A are based on section 90B of the Scotland \nAct 1998 which they to a very large extent replicate, although in the latter \ncase the power relates to the transfer of the Crown Estate Commissioners’ \nexisting Scottish functions to the Scottish Ministers. In both cases, the \npower to make a transfer scheme is subject to parliamentary scrutiny, with \nthe draft affirmative resolution procedure applying. There is however one \nsignificant difference in the scrutiny provisions: whereas section 90B of the \nScotland Act 1998 provides for scrutiny only by both Houses of Parliament, \nsection 52A provides for scrutiny by both Houses and Senedd Cymru.\n6.   We do not consider that scrutiny of the power by Senedd Cymru is \nappropriate. The purpose of the transfer scheme is to set out the terms \non which a reserved matter, namely management of the Crown Estate in \nWales, should be devolved. In this context, the Bill enables the Treasury to \ninclude in the transfer scheme such provision as they consider necessary or \nexpedient in the interests of defence or national security, and also to include \nsuch provision as they consider necessary to ensure that the management \nof the Crown Estate in Wales does not conflict with other reserved maters, \nnamely the exploitation of oil or gas resources. Decisions relating to reserved \nmatters, and the terms on which they should be devolved, are in our view \nappropriately for the UK Government to make subject to scrutiny by the \nUK Parliament, and this is reflected in the fact that the power to make the \nscheme is conferred on the Treasury. It does not seem to us appropriate (or \nconsistent with previous practice) to make powers exercisable solely by UK \nMinisters subject to scrutiny by a devolved legislature.\n7.    Accordingly, we consider that, consistently with the approach for \nScotland under section 90B of the Scotland Act 1998, the powers \nconferred by section 52A of the Wales Act 2017 should be subject to \nscrutiny solely by both Houses of Parliament.\n4\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n    NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS (SECONDARY \nCLASS 1 CONTRIBUTIONS) BILL\n8.   This Bill contains no delegations of legislative power.\n FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  TO UKRAINE BILL\n9.   \nThis Money Bill contains no delegations of legislative power.\n5\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nAP PENDIX  1:    MEMBERS’ INTERESTS\n   Committee Members’ registered interests may be examined in the online Register \nof Lords’ Interests at https://www.parliament.uk/hlregister .

(b) ending  no earlier  than  the end of the next  football  season  after  the \napplication  is made. \n17 Grant  of provisional  operating  licence \n(1) This  section  applies  where  a club  applies  for a provisional  operating  licence \nunder  section  16. \n30 (2) The IFR must  grant  the club  a provisional  operating  licence  if it is satisfied \nthat the club  would— \n(a) operate  a relevant  team, \n(b) comply  with  the mandatory  licence  conditions  (see section  20), and \n(c) comply  with  sections  45 to 53 (duties  on clubs). \n35 (3) The IFR— \n(a) must  specify  in

IFR is not satisfied  of the matters  in subsection  (2), it must  give  the \nclub  a notice— Football  Governance  Bill [HL] 10 \nPart 3—Operating  licences \n(a) stating  that it proposes  to refuse  to grant  the provisional  operating \nlicence, \n(b) explaining  why  it proposes  to refuse  to grant  the licence, \n(c) \n5inviting  the club  to make  representations  about  the proposed  refusal, \nand \n(d) specifying  the means  by which,  and the period  within  which,  such \nrepresentations  must  be made, \nand must  have  regard  to any representations  which  are duly  made. \n(5) \n10The period  specified  in the notice  for making  representations  must  be a period \nof not less than  14 days  beginning  with  the day on which  the notice  is given. \n(6) After  complying  with  subsection  (4), the IFR must— \n(a) grant  the provisional  operating  licence  and notify  the club of the grant, \nor \n(b) \n15refuse  to grant  the licence  and notify  the club  of the refusal,  giving \nreasons  for it. \n(7) The IFR may  not grant  a club a provisional  operating  licence  under  this section \nexcept  as mentioned  in subsection  (2). \n(8) Where  the IFR grants  a club  a provisional  operating  licence  under  this section \n20the IFR must  specify  in the notice  under  subsection  (3)(b) or (6)(a) (as the \ncase may  be) the day on which  the licence  comes  into force,  which  may  not \nbe before  the day on which  the club  operates  a relevant  team. \n(9) The IFR must  specify  in rules— \n(a) the period  within  which  it must  make  the decision  whether  to grant \nthe club  a provisional  operating  licence, \n25 (b) any circumstances  in which  it may  extend  that period,  and \n(c) the maximum  period  for which  that period  may  be extended. \n18 Grant  of full operating  licence \n(1) Where  a club  holds  a provisional  operating  licence,  the IFR must  decide \nwhether  to grant  the club  a full operating  licence— \n30 (a) before  the end of the period  specified  by virtue  of section  17(3)(a), or \n(b) if applicable,  before  the end of the further  period  specified  by virtue \nof subsection  (6)(b). \n(2) The IFR— \n(a) \n35must  grant  a club  a full operating  licence  if the full licence  test is met \nin relation  to the club; \n(b) must  notify  the club  of the grant  of the licence. \n(3) The “full  licence  test”  is met in relation  to a club  if— \n(a) the IFR is satisfied  that the club— \n(i) is operating  a relevant  team, \n40 (ii) meets  the threshold  requirements  set out in Schedule  4, and 11 Football  Governance  Bill [HL] \nPart 3—Operating  licences \n(iii) complies  and would  continue  to comply  with  the mandatory \nlicence  conditions  (see section  20) and sections  45 to 53 (duties \non clubs),  and \n(b) \n5the IFR has not determined,  and is not treated  as having  determined, \nunder  Part 4 that any person  who  is an owner  or officer  of the club \nis not suitable  to be an owner  or officer  of the club. \n(4) If the IFR considers  that the full licence  test is not met in relation  to the club, \nthe IFR must  give  the club  a notice— \n(a) stating  that it proposes  to— \n10 (i) refuse  to grant  the full operating  licence,  and \n(ii) take action  under  subsection  (6)(b) or section  19, \n(b) explaining  why  it proposes  to take such  action, \n(c) inviting  the club  to make  representations  about  the proposed  action, \nand \n15 (d) specifying  the means  by which,  and the period  within  which,  such \nrepresentations

beginning  with  the day on which  the notice  under  subsection \n(4) is given. \n(6) Subject  to section  19, after  complying  with  subsection  (4) the IFR must— \n(a) where  the IFR considers  that the full licence  test is met in relation  to \nthe club,  grant  the club  a full operating  licence  and notify  the club  of \nthe grant,  or \n25 (b) where  the IFR considers  that the full licence  test would  be met in \nrelation  to the club  within  a reasonable  period  if more  time  is given \nfor the test to be met,  specify  a further  period  for which  the club’s \nprovisional  operating  licence  is to have  effect. \n(7) \n30A further  period  specified  by virtue  of subsection  (6)(b) must  be such  period \nas the IFR considers  sufficient  to enable  the full licence  test to be met in \nrelation  to the club. \n(8) The IFR may  not grant  a club  a full operating  licence  under  this section  other \nthan  where  it considers  that the full licence  test is met in relation  to the club. \n(9) \n35Where  the IFR grants  a club  a full operating  licence  under  this section  the \nIFR must  specify  in the notice  under  subsection  (2)(b) or (6)(a) (as the case \nmay  be) the day on which  the licence  comes  into force,  at which  time  the \nclub’s  provisional  operating  licence  ceases  to have  effect. \n19 Revocation  and cessation  of operating  licence \n(1) The IFR may  revoke  a club’s  provisional  operating  licence  if— \n40 (a) the full licence  test (as defined  in section  18(3)) is not met in relation \nto the club,  and \n(b) the IFR considers  that— Football  Governance  Bill [HL] 12 \nPart 3—Operating  licences \n(i) the club  has persistently  and without  reasonable  excuse  failed \nto take such  steps  as are reasonable  for that test to be met in \nrelation  to the club,  and \n(ii) \n5there  is no reasonable  prospect  of the test being  met in relation \nto the club  within  a reasonable  period  even  if the club  were \ngiven  more  time  for the test to be met. \n(2) For the purposes  of subsection  (1)(b)(i), a club’s  failure  is persistent  if the \nfailure  has occurred  on a sufficient  number  of occasions  for it to be clear  that \nit represents  a pattern  of behaviour  or practice. \n10 (3) Where  the IFR revokes  a club’s  provisional  operating  licence  under  subsection \n(1) the IFR must  give  the club  a notice— \n(a) stating  that it is revoking  the club’s  provisional  operating  licence  from \na date  specified  in the notice,  and \n(b) explaining  why  it is revoking  the club’s  licence. \n15 (4) Where  a notice  under  subsection  (3) is given  during  a football  season,  the \ndate  specified  for the purposes  of subsection  (3)(a) may  not be a date  before \nthe end of that season. \n(5) See paragraphs  8 and 9 of Schedule  9 for further  provision  about  the \ncircumstances  in which  the IFR can revoke  a club’s  operating  licence. \n20 (6) An operating  licence  ceases  to have  effect  if the club holding  the licence  ceases \nto operate  a relevant  team. \nLicence  conditions \n20 Mandatory  licence  conditions \nSchedule  5— \n25 (a) sets out the licence  conditions  (referred  to in this Act as the “mandatory \nlicence  conditions”)  that the IFR must  attach  to each  club’s  operating \nlicence,  and \n(b) makes  provision  about  those  conditions. \n21 Discretionary  licence  conditions \n30 (1) The IFR may  attach  licence  conditions  other  than  mandatory  licence  conditions \nto a club’s  operating  licence. \n(2) A condition  attached  under  subsection  (1) is referred  to in this Act as a \n“discretionary  licence  condition”. \n(3) \n35The IFR may  attach  a discretionary  licence  condition  to an operating  licence \nonly  if the IFR is satisfied  that compliance  with  the condition  would— \n(a) in the case of a provisional  operating  licence,  ensure  that the club  will \nmeet,  or contribute  towards  the club  meeting,  the threshold \nrequirements  set out in Schedule  4 before  the end of the period  for \nwhich  the provisional  operating  licence  has effect; 13 Football  Governance  Bill [HL] \nPart 3—Operating  licences \n(b) in the case of a full operating  licence— \n(i) ensure  that the club  will meet,  or will continue  to meet,  or \n(ii) contribute  towards  the club  meeting,  or continuing  to meet, \nthe threshold  requirements; \n5 (c) in the case of a provisional  or full operating  licence,  advance  the IFR’s \nsystemic  financial  resilience  objective. \n(4) The IFR may  vary  a discretionary  licence  condition  where— \n(a) either— \n(i) the IFR considers  that the condition  is no longer  effective,  or \n10 (ii) there  has been  a material  change  in circumstances  affecting  the \nclub  since  the condition  was attached  to the operating  licence \nor previously  varied,  and \n(b) the condition  as varied  meets  a requirement  in subsection  (3). \n(5) Subsections  (3) and (4) are subject  to sections  22 to 25. \n15 (6) The IFR must— \n(a) remove  a discretionary  licence  condition  where  the IFR considers  that \nthe condition  is no longer  necessary,  and \n(b) notify  the club  concerned  about  the removal. \n(7) \n20A club  may  apply  to the IFR for the variation  or removal  of a discretionary \nlicence  condition. \n(8) An application  under  subsection  (7) must  explain  why  the variation  or removal \nis sought. \n(9) Where  a discretionary  licence  condition  is attached  to an operating  licence, \n25varied  or removed,  the IFR must  specify  in the licence  the time  from  which \nthe attached  condition,  variation  or removal  has effect. \n22 Scope  of powers  to attach  or vary  discretionary  licence  conditions \n(1) A discretionary  licence  condition  relating  to the financial  resources  threshold \nrequirement  (see paragraph  2 of Schedule  4) may  only— \n(a) relate  to debt  management, \n30 (b) relate  to liquidity  requirements, \n(c) restrict  the club’s  overall  expenditure,  or \n(d) restrict  the club’s  ability  to accept  or receive  funding  which  the IFR \nreasonably  suspects  to be connected  to serious  criminal  conduct. \n(2) \n35A discretionary  licence  condition  relating  to the non-financial  resources \nthreshold  requirement  (see paragraph  3 of Schedule  4) may  only  relate  to— \n(a) internal  controls, \n(b) risk management,  or \n(c) financial  reporting. \n(3) \n40A discretionary  licence  condition  relating  to the advancement  of the IFR’s \nsystemic  financial  resilience  objective  may  only— Football  Governance  Bill [HL] 14 \nPart 3—Operating  licences \n(a) relate  to debt  management, \n(b) relate  to liquidity  requirements,  or \n(c) restrict  the club’s  overall  expenditure. \n(4) \n5A discretionary  licence  condition  attached  in reliance  on subsection  (1)(c) or \n(3)(c) may  not impose  restrictions  on expenditure  of a particular  kind  or a \nparticular  transaction. \n(5) The Secretary  of State  may  by regulations  amend  subsection  (1), (2) or (3) to \nadd,  vary  or remove  an item. \n(6) \n10The Secretary  of State  may  make  regulations  under  subsection  (5) only  if \nrequested  in writing  to do so by the IFR. \n(7) A request  under  subsection  (6) must  explain  why  the IFR considers  that the \nmaking  of regulations  under  this section  is compatible  with  the purpose  of \nthis Act. \n(8) \n15Before  submitting  a request  under  subsection  (6), the IFR must  consult  such \npersons  as the IFR considers  appropriate. \n23 Procedure  for attaching  or varying  financial  discretionary  licence  conditions \n(1) This  section  applies  to a discretionary  licence  condition  relating  to— \n(a) the financial  resources  threshold  requirement,  or \n(b) the advancement  of the IFR’s  systemic  financial  resilience  objective. \n20 (2) Before  attaching  or varying  a discretionary  licence  condition  to which  this \nsection  applies,  the IFR must  give  a notice  about  the proposed  condition  or \nvariation  to— \n(a) the club,  and \n(b) \n25the specified  competition  organiser  which  organises  a specified \ncompetition  in relation  to which  a relevant  team  is operated  by the \nclub. \n(3) The notice  must— \n(a) give  details  of the proposed  condition  or variation, \n(b) \n30explain  why  the IFR is proposing  to attach  the condition  or make  the \nvariation, \n(c) invite— \n(i) the club  and the specified  competition  organiser  to make \nrepresentations  about  the proposed  condition  or variation,  and \n(ii) \n35the specified  competition  organiser  to give  a commitment  to \ntake action  in lieu of the proposed  condition  or variation,  and \n(d) specify  the means  by which,  and the period  within  which,  such \nrepresentations  must  be made  or such  a commitment  must  be given. \n(4) The period  specified  in the notice  for making  representations  or giving  a \n40commitment  must  be a period  of not less than  14 days  beginning  with  the \nday on which  the notice  is given. 15 Football  Governance  Bill [HL] \nPart 3—Operating  licences \n(5) The IFR must— \n(a) have  regard  to any representations  which  are duly  made,  and \n(b) where  the specified  competition  organiser  gives  a commitment \n5mentioned  in subsection  (3)(c)(ii) within  the period  specified  in the \nnotice,  consider  whether  to accept  that commitment. \n(6) This  section  does  not apply  where— \n(a) a club  applies  for a variation  under  section  21(7), or \n(b) the IFR considers  that compliance  with  this section  would  jeopardise, \n10or risk jeopardising,  the IFR’s  ability  to advance  one or more  of its \nobjectives. \n24 Commitments  in lieu of financial  discretionary  licence  conditions \n(1) This  section  applies  where  a specified  competition  organiser  gives  a \ncommitment  mentioned  in section  23(3)(c)(ii) (commitment  to take action  in \nlieu of the proposed  condition  or variation). \n15 (2) The IFR may  accept  the commitment  if it considers  that— \n(a) compliance  with  the commitment  by the specified  competition  organiser \nwould  mean  that it would  not be necessary  to attach  the proposed \ndiscretionary  licence  condition  or make  the proposed  variation,  and \n(b) \n20accepting  the commitment  would  not jeopardise,  or risk jeopardising, \nthe IFR’s  ability  to advance  one or more  of its objectives. \n(3) Where  the IFR accepts  a commitment  under  this section— \n(a) the IFR may  not attach  the proposed  discretionary  licence  condition \nor make  the proposed  variation  while  the commitment  is in force,  and \n(b) \n25the specified  competition  organiser  that gave  the commitment  must \ncomply  with  it while  it has effect. \n(4) Where  the IFR does  not accept  the commitment  under  this section,  the IFR— \n(a) must  notify  the specified  competition  organiser  and the club concerned \nand provide  reasons  for its decision,  and \n(b) \n30may  without  further  notice  attach  the proposed  discretionary  licence \ncondition  or make  the proposed  variation. \n(5) The IFR may,  from  time  to time,  accept  from  a specified  competition  organiser \na variation  to a commitment  accepted  under  this section,  provided  that the \nIFR considers  that the commitment  as varied  would  still meet  the requirements \nin subsection  (2). \n35 (6) The IFR may  release  a specified  competition  organiser  from  a commitment \naccepted  under  this section  where  it considers  that— \n(a) the commitment  is no longer  necessary, \n(b) the commitment  is no longer  effective,  or \n(c) \n40the specified  competition  organiser  has failed  to comply  with  the \ncommitment. Football  Governance  Bill [HL] 16 \nPart 3—Operating  licences \n(7) Where,  under  subsection  (6)(b) or (c), the IFR releases  a specified  competition \norganiser  from  a commitment  accepted  under  this section,  the IFR may— \n(a) without  further  notice  attach  the proposed  discretionary  licence \ncondition  or make  the proposed  variation,  or \n5 (b) attach  an alternative  discretionary  licence  condition  or make  an \nalternative  variation  to a discretionary  licence  condition. \n(8) Before  attaching  an alternative  discretionary  licence  condition  or making  an \nalternative  variation  by virtue  of subsection  (7)(b), the IFR must  give  the club \na notice  that— \n10 (a) notifies  the club  about  the proposed  alternative  condition  or variation, \n(b) invites  the club to make  representations  about  the proposed  alternative \ncondition  or variation,  and \n(c) specifies  the means  by which,  and the period  within  which,  such \nrepresentations  must  be made, \n15 and must  have  regard  to any representations  which  are duly  made. \n(9) The period  specified  in the notice  for making  representations  must  be a period \nof not less than  14 days  beginning  with  the day on which  the notice  is given. \n(10) A commitment  accepted  by the IFR under  this section— \n(a) \n20comes  into force  on the day specified  in the notice  given  to the \nspecified  competition  organiser  under  paragraph  3 of Schedule  6, and \n(b) ceases  to have  effect  if the specified  competition  organiser  is released \nfrom  the commitment  under  subsection  (6). \n(11) The fact that a commitment  accepted  under  this section  ceases  to have  effect \n25does  not affect  the exercise  of any functions  in relation  to a failure,  or possible \nfailure,  to comply  with  the commitment. \n(12) The IFR must  keep  under  review— \n(a) the extent  to which  a specified  competition  organiser  which  gave  a \ncommitment  accepted  under  this section  is complying  with  it, \n(b) \n30whether  a specified  competition  organiser  should  be released  from  a \ncommitment  under  this section  (including  whether  to release  a specified \ncompetition  organiser  from  a commitment  and attach  or vary  a \ndiscretionary  licence  condition  to an operating  licence  instead),  and \n(c) whether  to take action  in accordance  with  Part 8 in respect  of a \n35specified  competition  organiser  which  fails to comply  with  a \ncommitment. \n(13) Schedule  6 makes  further  provision  about  commitments  mentioned  in section \n23(3)(c)(ii). \n25 Procedure  for attaching  or varying  other  discretionary  licence  conditions \n(1) This  section  applies  to a discretionary  licence  condition  relating  to— \n40 (a) the non-financial  resources  threshold  requirement  (see paragraph  3 of \nSchedule  4), or 17 Football  Governance  Bill [HL] \nPart 3—Operating  licences \n(b) the fan engagement  threshold  requirement  (see paragraph  4 of Schedule \n4). \n(2) Before  attaching  or varying  a discretionary  licence  condition  to which  this \nsection  applies,  the IFR must  give  the club  a notice  that— \n5 (a) notifies  the club  about  the proposed  condition  or variation  (including \nthe threshold  requirement  to which  the condition  or variation  relates), \n(b) invites  the club  to make  representations  about  the proposed  condition \nor variation,  and \n(c) \n10specifies  the means  by which,  and the period  within  which,  such \nrepresentations  must  be made, \nand must  have  regard  to any representations  which  are duly  made. \n(3) The period  specified  in the notice  for making  representations  must  be a period \nof not less than  14 days  beginning  with  the day on which  the notice  is given \nto the club. \n15 (4) This  section  does  not apply  where— \n(a) a club  applies  for a variation  under  section  21(7), or \n(b) the IFR considers  that compliance  with  this section  would  jeopardise, \nor risk jeopardising,  the IFR’s  ability  to advance  one or more  of its \nobjectives. \n20 PART 4 \nOWNERS AND OFFICERS OF REGULATED CLUBS: SUITABILITY ETC \nIntroductory \n26 Part 4: overview  and interpretation \n(1) This  Part makes  provision— \n25 (a) requiring  notices  to be given  to the IFR before  a person  becomes  an \nowner  or officer  of a regulated  club,  or where  there  is a change  of \ncircumstances  relating  to a person’s  role as an owner  or officer  of a \nregulated  club, \n(b) \n30for the making  of determinations  by the IFR about  the suitability  of \na person  to be an owner  or officer  of a regulated  club,  and \n(c) for action  that may  or must  be taken  by the IFR where  it determines \nor is treated  as having  determined  that a person  is not suitable  to be \nan owner  or officer  of a regulated  club. \n(2) \n35Sections  27 to 32 deal

IFR may  decide  that the resolution  process  should  be triggered  in relation \nto a qualifying  football  season  only  if the IFR— \n30 (a) is satisfied  that at least  one of the conditions  in section  57 is met in \nrelation  to that season,  and \n(b) has reasonable  grounds  to suspect  that its ability  to advance  at least \none of its objectives  would  be jeopardised  if the resolution  process \nwere  not triggered. \n35 (3) In deciding  whether  the resolution  process  should  be triggered,  the IFR may \nhave  regard  to the purposes  for which  the distributed  revenue  would  be used. \n(4) In deciding  whether  the resolution  process  should  be triggered  in reliance  on \nthe condition  in section  57(3), the IFR may  have  regard  to whether  the situation \n40described  in section  57(3)(a) (no distribution  agreement  in force)  has arisen \nas a result  of bad faith  on the part of either  of the specified  competition \norganisers.

Football  Governance  Bill [HL] 56 \nPart 7—Investigatory  powers  etc \n(6) Where  the IFR delays  giving  an investigation  notice  in accordance  with \nsubsection  (5), it must  give  the investigation  notice  to the person  concerned \nas soon  as reasonably  practicable  after  the IFR no longer  considers  that giving \nthe notice  would  prejudice  the investigation. \n5 69 Outcomes  of investigations \n(1) When  the IFR conducts  an investigation  under  section  68 into whether  a \nperson  has committed  a relevant  infringement,  the IFR must  determine— \n(a) whether  the person  committed  the infringement,  and \n(b) \n10if so, whether  the person  had a reasonable  excuse  for committing  the \ninfringement. \n(2) The IFR must  give  a person  a closure  notice  where— \n(a) the IFR determines  that the person  has not committed  the infringement, \nor \n(b) \n15the IFR determines  that the person  has committed  the infringement \nbut is not minded  to take any action  as a result  of that determination \n(whether  because  the person  had a reasonable  excuse  for committing \nthe infringement,  or otherwise). \n(3) A closure  notice  is a notice— \n(a) stating  the IFR’s  determination,  and \n20 (b) explaining  the IFR’s  determination. \n(4) Where  the IFR has accepted  a commitment  from  the person  to whom  an \ninvestigation  relates  (see section  70), this section  does  not apply  in relation \nto the behaviour  to which  the commitment  relates. \n(5) \n25Part 8 contains  provision  about  cases  where  the IFR determines  that a person \nhas committed  a relevant  infringement  and is minded  to take action  as a \nresult  of that determination. \n70 Commitments  in lieu of investigations \n(1) Where  an investigation  under  section  68 relates  to a relevant  infringement  to \n30which  this section  applies,  the IFR may  accept  an appropriate  commitment \nfrom  the person  to whom  the investigation  relates  as to their  behaviour  in \nrespect  of the relevant  infringement. \n(2) A commitment  is “appropriate”  if the IFR considers  that the person’s \ncompliance  with  the commitment  would  mean  that it would  not be necessary \n35to carry  out an investigation  so far as relating  to the behaviour  to which  the \ncommitment  relates. \n(3) Where  the IFR accepts  a commitment  under  this section — \n(a) subject  to subsection  (4), the IFR may  not take action  under  Part 8 in \nrespect  of the relevant  infringement,  so far as relating  to the behaviour, \nand \n40 (b) the person  that gave  the commitment  must  comply  with  it while  it \nhas effect. 57 Football  Governance  Bill [HL] \nPart 7—Investigatory  powers  etc \n(4) But the acceptance  of a commitment— \n(a) does  not prevent  an investigation  from  continuing  so far as it relates \nto other  behaviour  in relation  to the same  or a different  relevant \ninfringement; \n5 (b) does  not prevent  the IFR beginning  a new  investigation  in relation  to \nthe behaviour  to which  the commitment  relates  where  the IFR has \nreasonable  grounds  to suspect  that— \n(i) there  has been  a material  change  of circumstances  since  the \ncommitment  was accepted, \n10 (ii) the person  has not complied  with  the commitment  in any \nrespect,  or \n(iii) information  which  led it to accept  the commitment  was \nincomplete,  false  or misleading  in a material  particular. \n(5) \n15This  section  applies  to relevant  infringements  that are relevant  infringements \nby virtue  of any of the following  provisions  of Schedule  7— \n(a) paragraph  2(2)(a), (b), (e) or (h); \n(b) paragraph  2(3)(c) or (d); \n(c) paragraph  3(a) or (f); \n(d) paragraph  4(a) or (f); \n20 (e) paragraph  5, but only  so far as the relevant  infringement  mentioned \nin sub-paragraph  (1)(a) of that paragraph  is a relevant  infringement \nmentioned  in paragraph  (a) or (b) of this subsection ; \n(f) paragraph  6(b), (c) or (f). \n(6) \n25This  section  is without  prejudice  to the power  of the IFR to attach  or vary  a \ndiscretionary  licence  condition  to an operating  licence  that relates  to behaviour \nin respect  of a relevant  infringement. \n71 Section  70: supplementary \n(1) Where  the IFR decides  to accept,  or not to accept,  a commitment  from  a \n30person  under  section  70 the IFR must,  as soon  as reasonably  practicable  after \nso deciding,  give  the person  a notice— \n(a) including  the commitment, \n(b) stating  the relevant  infringement  to which  the commitment  relates, \n(c) stating  that the IFR has accepted,  or not accepted,  the commitment, \nand \n35 (d) explaining  why  the IFR has accepted,  or not accepted,  the commitment. \n(2) A commitment  accepted  under  section  70— \n(a) comes  into force  when  notice  of the IFR’s  acceptance  of it is given \nunder  subsection  (1), and \n(b) \n40ceases  to

I do, however, have two points to note.  \n \nFirstly, in their assessment of compatibility,  the promoters do not express a view on whether the General \nCemetery Company  (the “ Company ”) is a “public authority” for the purposes of section 6(3)(b) of the \nHuman Rights Act 1998 (the “1998 Act”). However, in my view, in considering the compatibility of the Bill \nwith the Convention, it is appropriate to consider whether the Company  will be subject to the duty in \nsection 6(1) of the 1998 Act to act compatibly with the Convention rights. I consider that the Company will \nbe exercising public functions within the meaning of the 1998 Act, and will therefore be subject to this duty \nwhen exercising the relevant functions. Nevertheless, as noted above, this does not affect my conclusion \nthat the proposals are consistent with the Convention.  \n \nSecondly, the promoters’ assessment of compatibility considered whether any interference with the \nrelevant Convention rights, which is necessary for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others in \nusing the cemetery, is justifiable and proportionate. The promoters have taken into consideration in \nparticular the safeguards contained in the Bill. I have, however, also considered whether there may be \nalternative means available of achieving the same aim, which would not involve interference with \nConvention rights. I am satisfied that other methods of developing burial space have already been \nimplemented to the extent available. I therefore agree with the promoters’ assessment that the powers \nconferred by the Bill are both justified and proportionate.  \n \n \n \n \n \nLORD PONSONBY OF SHULBREDE",

The Holocaust Memorial Bill concerns the building of a Holocaust memorial \nand learning centre. The project began with the launch in January 2014 of \nthe Holocaust Commission by the then Prime Minister (the Rt Hon. David \nCameron MP). The Commission published a report a year later, Britain’s \nPromise to Remember , recommending that there should be a\n“… striking new memorial to serve as the focal point of national \ncommemoration of the Holocaust. It should be prominently located in \nCentral London to make a bold statement about the importance Britain \nplaces on preserving the memory of the Holocaust”.\n2. The Commission also recommended that the memorial should be co-located \nwith “a world-class Learning Centre” and that an endowment fund should \nbe established to secure the long-term future of Holocaust education.\n3. The Prime Minister accepted the Commission’s recommendations and set \nup the United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Foundation (“UKHMF”) to \ntake them forward. In January 2016, following a recommendation by the \nUKHMF, the Prime Minister announced that the memorial would be built \nin Victoria Tower Gardens (“VTG”). Later that year, it was confirmed that \nthe learning centre would be co-located with the memorial.\n4. A design competition was then launched. In October 2017 it was announced \nthat Adjaye Associates, Ron Arad Architects and the landscape architects \nGustafson Porter + Bowman had been selected.\n5. The selection of VTG as the location for the memorial and learning centre \ngave rise to controversy. Its critics considered, among other things, that the \nselection was based on a non-transparent and flawed process and without \nadequate public consultation. The design of the memorial also proved to be \ncontroversial. The controversy on these issues has not gone away. Many of \nthose who appeared before the Committee as petitioners and as witnesses \ntook the opportunity to make their views known. We listened carefully to \nwhat they had to say. But, for reasons that will be explained later in this \nReport, it is not open to us to adjudicate on these issues. This is not a public \ninquiry, and we have not heard both sides of the argument. Accordingly, \nthe Committee must refrain from expressing a view about them, one way or \nanother.\n Planning application \n6. In December 2018 the then Secretary of State for Housing, Communities \nand Local Government applied to Westminster City Council for planning \npermission. Special handling arrangements were made in the Ministry to \ncreate a functional separation, which has been called an “ethical divide”, \nbetween the Secretary of State, as the applicant for planning permission, and \nthose responsible for determining the application. In November 2019 the \nplanning application was called in by the then Housing Minister. A planning \n4 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\ninquiry was held in October and November 2020. The Planning Inspector \nheard evidence over 20 days. His report to the Housing Minister, which ran \nto 243 pages, recommended that the application be approved and planning \npermission granted.1 The Housing Minister agreed and granted planning \npermission in July 2021.\n7. A coloured representation of the greater part of the proposed Holocaust \nMemorial and Learning Centre (“the proposed HMLC”) is at Appendix 1 .  \nA plan showing the location of the proposed HMLC and other elements of \nthe final project within VTG when completed is at Appendix 2 .\n8. In September 2021 London Historic Parks and Gardens Trust made an \napplication in the High Court for statutory review of the grant of planning \npermission. One of the grounds for the ensuing judicial review concerned \nthe Inspector’s failure to address the significance of section 8 of the London \nCounty Council (Improvements) Act 1900 (“the 1900 Act”), the relevant \nprovisions of which are as follows:\n“(1) The lands lying to the eastward of the new street described in this \nAct as consisting in part of widenings of Abingdon Street and Millbank \nStreet which is in this section called “the new street” and between \nthe said street and the new embankment wall shall be laid out and \nmaintained in manner herein-after provided for use as a garden open to \nthe public and as an integral part of the existing Victoria Tower Garden \nsubject to such byelaws and regulations as the Commissioners of Works \nmay determine: \n…\n(8)  The Commissioners shall maintain the garden so laid out and the \nembankment wall and kerb and railings enclosing it: …”\n9. The Hon. Mrs Justice Thornton quashed the decision to grant planning \npermission.2 She said (paragraph 76) that: \n“… section 8(1) of the 1900 Act imposes an enduring obligation to lay \nout and retain the new garden land for use as a garden and integral part \nof the existing Victoria Tower Gardens.”\n10. She further held that the potential impediment to delivery of the scheme \nwas a material consideration which was not considered by the Minister and \nshould have been. In July 2022, the Court of Appeal refused permission to \nappeal her judgment. \n11. The approval of the Minister having been quashed, the planning application \nremains to be re-determined. The same handling arrangements and “ethical \ndivide” continue to operate within the Ministry. It will be a matter for the \nMinister making the re-determination to decide whether to re-open the \nplanning inquiry or to receive written representations.  Mr Katkowski KC, \nlead counsel representing the Secretary of State, who is the Promoter of the \nHolocaust Memorial Bill and the applicant for planning permission,  drew the \nCommittee’s attention to a letter dated 2 October 2024 in which interested \n1 https://assets.publishing. service.gov.uk/media/6102679e8fa8f50428d10083/Combined_DL_IR_R_\nto_C_Victoria_Tower_Gardens.pdf\n2 https://www.judiciary.uk/ wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LHPGT-v-Minister-for-Housing-\nJudgment- 080422.pdf\n5 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nparties were invited to make written representations to the decision-making \nMinister about issues relating to the Bill and the implications of the decision \nof the High Court on the timing of the delivery of the project. The letter also \nstated that the decision-making Minister would invite further representations \nbefore making a re-determination of the grant of planning permission \nfollowing a re-activation of the planning application under Rule 19 of the \nTown and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000 \n(the relevant provisions of which are set out at Appendix 3 ).\n Legislative setting of the Holocaust Memorial Bill \n12. The purpose of the Holocaust Memorial Bill is, in effect, and as appears \nfrom the Explanatory Notes accompanying the Bill, to remedy the finding of \nthe High Court by removing the obstacle in section 8(1) and (8) of the 1900 \nAct to the building of the proposed HMLC in VTG.\n13. The Bill is a hybrid bill. This means that it is a public bill which adversely \naffects the private interests of certain individuals and organisations. For this \nreason, while a hybrid bill proceeds for the most part as a public bill, certain \nprivate bill procedures also apply, enabling those whose property or interests \nare directly and specially affected by the bill to petition against it and to have \ntheir petitions considered by a select committee. The second reading affirms \nthe “principle” of the bill.\n Proceedings in the House of Commons \n14. The Holocaust Memorial Bill was introduced to the House of Commons on \n23 February 2023. After second reading, a Select Committee was appointed \nwith an instruction agreed by the House setting out the principle of the Bill. \nThe instruction stated:\n“(1) That the Committee treats the principle of the Bill, as determined \nby the House on the Bill’s second reading, as comprising the matters \nmentioned in paragraph (2); and those matters shall accordingly not be \nat issue during proceedings of the Committee.\n(2) The matters referred to in paragraph (1) are—\n(a) the Secretary of State may incur expenditure for or in connection \nwith (i) a memorial commemorating the victims of the Holocaust, \nand (ii) a centre for learning relating to the memorial; and\n(b) section 8(1) and (8) of the London County Council \n(Improvements) Act 1900 are not to prevent, restrict or otherwise \naffect the construction, use, operation, maintenance or improvement \nof such a memorial and centre for learning at Victoria Tower Gardens \nin the City of Westminster.\n(3) Given paragraph (2) and as the Bill does not remove the need for \nplanning permission and all other necessary consents being obtained \nin the usual way for the construction, use, operation, maintenance and \nimprovement of the memorial and centre for learning, the Committee \nshall not hear any petition against the Bill to the extent that the petition \nrelates to—\n(a) the question of whether or not there should be a memorial \ncommemorating the victims of the Holocaust or a centre for learning \n6 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nrelating to the memorial, whether at Victoria Tower Gardens or \nelsewhere; or\n(b) whether or not planning permission and all other necessary \nconsents should be given for the memorial and centre for learning, \nor the terms and conditions on which they should be given.\n(4) The Committee shall have power to consider any amendments \nproposed by the member in charge of the Bill which, if the Bill were \na private bill, could not be made except upon petition for additional \nprovision.\n(5) Paragraph (4) applies only so far as the amendments proposed by \nthe member in charge of the Bill fall within the principle of the Bill as \nprovided for by paragraphs (1) and (2) above.”\n15. Ten petitions were deposited (although two later withdrawn) and, following \npublic hearings in which the Promoter and petitioners were able to present \ntheir cases, the Committee reported in April 2024. The Committee did not \namend the Bill but raised several matters of concern in its Special Report.3 \nThe remaining public bill stages in the House of Commons took place on 22 \nMay. It was passed with no amendments.\n Proceedings in the House of Lords \n16. The Bill was introduced to the House of Lords on 23 May 2024, shortly \nbefore the dissolution of Parliament on 30 May. As a result of dissolution, \nthe petitioning period, which began the day after introduction, was extended \nto 17 July. Eighteen petitions were deposited. The petitioners are set out \nin Appendix 4 . Following second reading on 4 September, the Bill was \ncommitted to this Select Committee, the House of Lords Select Committee \non the Holocaust Memorial Bill, to consider those petitions. Unlike the \nposition in the House of Commons, no instruction to the Committee was \npassed setting out the principle of the Bill. \n17. The Committee considered the petitions in three stages. These were, briefly, \nas follows:\nStanding:  In contrast to the stance taken by the Promoter in the House of \nCommons, where the Promoter did not challenge the right of any petitioner to \nbe heard, in this House the standing of the majority of them was challenged. \nAccordingly, the first task of the Committee was to consider the right to be \nheard of all those petitioners whose standing was contested by the Promoter. \nThe Committee decided that some petitioners had standing, and some did \nnot. The Committee announced its decisions on 13 November. They are \nexplained in Chapter 2 of this Report.\nPrinciple and scope: The Committee then proceeded to consider the principle \nand scope of the Bill. These are addressed in Chapter 3 of this Report. The \nCommittee announced its provisional findings on principle and scope at a \nhearing on 19 November. In coming to its view, the Committee took into \naccount the submissions of parties present on 19 November. It also invited \nsubmissions on principle and scope from those who were not present that day \nbut appeared later. The Committee did not however amend its provisional \nfindings, and they are explained in Chapter 3 of this Report.\n3  House of Commons, First Special Report , (Session 2023-24, HC 121) \n7 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nSubstantive issues raised in petitions : The Committee finally considered the \nsubstantive issues raised in the petitions of those who had standing and \nwhat remedies might be appropriate. These are set out in Chapter 4 of this \nReport. A summary of recommendations by the Committee and assurances \nand an undertaking given to the Committee by the Promoter in response to \nrequests by the Committee are set out in Appendix 5  (and associated plan \nin Appendix 6 ).\n18. It is apparent both from the second reading debate as well as the submissions \nmade to the Committee by or on behalf of some of the petitioners that many \nmembers of the House are unaware of the constraints on the Committee \nboth as to which petitioners are entitled to be heard by the Committee and \nas to the arguments petitioners who have standing can advance. Those \nconstraints are addressed in detail in Chapter 2 paragraphs 21 to 38 (right to \nbe heard) and Chapter 3 paragraphs 62 to 73 (limitation on arguments). A \nvery brief summary of those constraints is contained in Appendix 7.\n After the Committee has reported\n19. Once the Bill has been reported from the Committee, it is re-committed to \na Committee of the whole House or a Grand Committee. It will then follow \nthe usual public bill procedure of report and third reading. Some of the \nrestrictions which we have had to accept will no longer apply.\n Acknowledgment\n20. The project for the erection of the proposed HMLC in VTG has given rise \nto strong feelings on both sides, and for many of those who addressed us the \nproceedings have been unfamiliar and challenging. The Committee would \nlike to thank all those who participated in the Committee’s proceedings.\n8 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nCHAPTER 2:  RIGHT TO BE HEARD\n21. The starting point on the question whether a petitioner has the right to be \nheard is that, contrary to some of the submissions we heard on behalf of the \npetitioners, the Committee does not have an unfettered discretion to allow \na petitioner to speak to their petition. We reject as plainly unsustainable the \nproposition advanced by at least one of the petitioners that each opposed \nprivate or hybrid bill select committee has a completely free hand as to which \npetitions it will consider.\n22. Generally speaking, a petitioner has a right to be heard if they prove that their \nproperty or interests are directly and specially affected by the bill: Erskine \nMay (25th edition, 2019), paragraph 44.5.\n23. In addition, the Private Business Standing Orders of the House specify \nvarious circumstances in which a petitioner has the right to have their \npetition considered (Standing Orders 115, 117A, 119 and 120) and other \ncases where the committee has a discretion to consider a petition (Standing \nOrders 117 and 118).\n24. In the present case the only Standing Orders that are relevant are 117(2) \nand 118. Standing Order 117(2) provides that where any society, association \nor other body, sufficiently representing amenity, educational, travel or \nrecreational interests, petitions against a bill, alleging that the interests they \nrepresent will be adversely affected to a material extent by the provisions \ncontained in the bill, it shall be competent for the select committee, if they \nthink fit, to permit petitioners to have their petition considered by the \ncommittee on such allegations against the bill or any part of it.  Standing \nOrder 118 states that it is competent for the select committee, if they think \nfit, to permit petitioners, being the local authority of any area the whole or \npart of which is alleged in the petition to be injuriously affected by a bill or \nany provisions of it, or being any of the inhabitants of such area, to have their \npetition against the bill or any provisions of it considered by the committee.\n25. Standing Order 114 says that the committee shall decide on the rights of the \npetitioners to have their petitions considered.\n26. Proceedings in a select committee on a hybrid bill are, generally speaking, \nthe same as for a select committee on a private bill: Erskine May (25th \nedition, 2019), paragraph 30.67. It is well established that the only role of \nthe select committee in the case of a hybrid bill is to ensure appropriate \nprotection of “private” interests affected by the bill. The House considers \nthe impact on the public and wider public issues in the usual stages of the \nlegislative process. \n27. If the petitioner cannot prove that they have a right to be heard and they do \nnot satisfy one or more of the grounds in the Standing Orders, then they do \nnot have standing to speak in support of their petition.\n28. Contrary to the view expressed to us by some of the petitioners, a member \nof the House of Lords does not have the right either by convention or under \nthe Standing Orders to have their petition considered simply because this is \na select committee of the House of Lords. This is in contrast to MPs who are \nexpressly entitled under Standing Order 117A to have their petition against a \n9 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nbill or any provisions of it considered by the committee if their constituencies \nare directly affected by the works proposed by the bill.\n29. In 1988 a report by the Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure (HL \nPaper 97, HC 625) said at paragraph 101:\n“… it is a fundamental principle of private legislation procedure that \nonly parties specially affected should be entitled to be heard and that \nthe rules of locus standi must be upheld. If they are allowed to lapse, \nmore of Members’ time will be taken up in Private Bill Committees. \n[We] recommend that promoters should be encouraged to police the \nrules of locus standi and that Private Bill Committees should not treat a \nreasonable but unsuccessful challenge as a point of prejudice”.\n30. Counsel for the Promoter advanced in argument the following further \nlimitations on the general conventional right to be heard. He said that the \npetitioner had to show some adverse impact of the bill on a property interest \nof the petitioner or something in the bill which, but for the bill, would have \nentitled the petitioner to bring a private law claim. He quoted, in support, the \nfollowing passage from a ruling by the House of Lords Select Committee on \nthe High Speed Rail (London-West Midlands) Bill, chaired by Lord Walker \nof Gestingthorpe, of 13 June 2016 (Session 2016-17, HL Paper 83, Appendix \n2, paragraph 8):\n“… an individual petitioner’s right to be heard as a right…depends on \nthat petitioner establishing the prospect of direct and material detriment \nto his or her property interests, either by compulsory acquisition or by \ninterference with his or her property rights which amounts to a common \nlaw nuisance, or some other interference which would be actionable if \nnot authorised by Parliament.”\n31. He also emphasised the passages in another ruling of the Select Committee \non the High Speed Rail (London-West Midlands) Bill of 21 June 2016 in \nwhich Lord Walker said (at paragraphs 15 and 16) that depreciated property \nvalue constituting non-statutory blight was not and had never been treated \nas a ground for petition. \n32. Counsel for the Promoter also said that there was a limitation on the discretion \nof a select committee under Standing Order 118 to permit participation by \nan inhabitant of the area alleged in the petition to be adversely affected by \na bill. He contended that individual inhabitants are not normally treated as \ncovered by Standing Order 118. He said that Standing Order 118 is directed \nat groups of persons who are petitioning as representatives of inhabitants of \nthe area and that, to qualify for the exercise of discretion under Standing \nOrder 118, an individual resident would need to be properly and sufficiently \nrepresentative of the inhabitants of the area generally.  He said that this \nconvention was based on 150 years of established practice and produced \nvarious precedents, including 19th century cases. \n33. We do not accept the arguments of the Promoter as to the narrow confines \nof entitlement to be heard and of the exercise of discretion under Standing \nOrder 118 in the present case. We are not bound by precedents in the same \nway as a court of law. While it is clear that the Select Committee does not \nhave an unlimited and unfettered discretion to hear any petitioner it chooses, \nthe approach of a select committee on standing, that is the right to be heard, \n10 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\ndepends upon the particular facts under consideration. This is reflected in the \nintroductory words – “Generally speaking” – in Erskine May’s explanation \nof an entitlement to be heard quoted above. A great number of the cases to \nwhich we were referred as precedents concern the compulsory acquisition of \nland from the petitioner.\n34. We do not accept that we are bound in the present case to apply the very \nnarrow proposition stated by Lord Walker in the High Speed Rail (London-\nWest Midlands) Bill quoted above that, in order for a petitioner to be entitled \nto have their petition heard by an opposed private or hybrid bill committee, \nthe petitioner must establish a direct and material detriment to their property \ninterest, either by compulsory acquisition or by interference with their \nproperty rights which amounts to a common law nuisance, or some other \ninterference which would be actionable if not authorised by Parliament. In \nthat case, as in so many others cited to us by counsel for the Promoter, what \nwas in issue concerned to a large extent the compulsory acquisition of land.  \nOf the 414 (of 821) petitions against that Bill where standing was challenged \nin the House of Lords, only 17 proceeded to a full hearing. The construction \nof a railway and property rights were central to the arguments on the right \nto be heard.\n35. The present case, which counsel for the Promoter accepted is unique, \nconcerns the removal of the statutory protection of VTG as a “garden open \nto the public” under section 8(1) of the 1900 Act and an amenity currently \nenjoyed. It is about the use of land, not the acquisition of property. The \ncontext and the facts of the two bills are strikingly different. For that reason, \nand because what is in dispute before us in terms of precedent concerns the \napplication of conventions, we consider that we are able to take an approach \nto standing in respect of the petitions where standing is challenged which \nis more flexible and liberal than as specified by Lord Walker. In the case of \nthe Holocaust Memorial Bill and entitlement to be heard, the unique subject \nmatter and implications of the Bill affect personal interests. A central issue \nis what constitutes a sufficiently affected personal interest in the way the \nGardens are used to give rise to an entitlement to be heard.\n36. So far as concerns the discretionary power under Standing Order 118 to hear \na petitioner, as an inhabitant of an injuriously affected area, the Standing \nOrder does not expressly qualify the discretion in any of the respects argued \non behalf of the Promoter. Insofar as convention requires an inhabitant to \nbe sufficiently representative of all the inhabitants of the area, we are not \naware of any ground for saying that the considerable number of individual \npetitioners or co-petitioners in the present case who reside near to VTG \ncould not satisfy this requirement.\n37. On the other hand, we reject the proposition, advanced by some of the \npetitioners, that working in the Palace of Westminster or in the vicinity of \nVTG, whether with or without a view of the Gardens, or with or without \nenjoyment of the amenity of the Gardens, is sufficient to confer a right to \nbe heard. Further, we do not accept the proposition advanced by one of \nthe petitioners that a person who works in the Palace of Westminster is an \n“inhabitant” within Standing Order 118.\n38. We also reject the proposition, advanced particularly forcefully on behalf of \nLord Inglewood, that it is permissible for the Select Committee to hear a \npetitioner just on the ground that they have expertise and knowledge enabling \n11 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nthem to highlight matters which might not otherwise be considered. To hear \na petition on that ground falls neither within the convention on the right to \nbe heard nor within the Standing Orders, so it lies outside our powers. His \npetition, however, has drawn attention to a gap in the House’s procedure, as \nhearing from petitioners who can demonstrate that they have those qualities \ncould be of significant value in some cases such as this one where there are \nmatters that deserve such attention. We suggest that the introduction of a \nnew or revised Standing Order to confer a discretion to hear them should be \nconsidered by the relevant House authorities.\n Petitioners found to have standing \n39. We decided that the following petitioners have standing.\n London Historic Parks and Gardens Trust\n40. This is an amenity society and registered charity which has an interest in \npreserving VTG as a Grade II Listed Public Park. It took an active part \nin the application for planning permission for the proposed HMLC. The \nPromoter has not objected to us considering the Trust’s petition. In the \nexercise of our discretion under Standing Order 117(2) we have considered \nthe Trust’s petition. \n Descendants of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton and the Treasurer and Trustee of the \nThomas Fowell Buxton Society \n41. These petitioners are concerned with the Buxton Memorial, a monument \nin VTG. The memorial commemorates the work of Thomas Fowell Buxton \nand others in the abolition of slavery.\n42. The Promoter has not objected to us considering this petition. In the \nexercise of our discretion under Standing Order 117(2) we have considered \nthe petition. The petition is stated to be submitted on behalf of the treasurer \nand trustee of the Society, and four members of the family of Thomas Fowell \nBuxton. The treasurer and trustee, Dr John Fannon, represents the Society, \nin whose favour we have exercised our discretion under Standing Order \n117(2). The four members of the Buxton family are entitled to be heard by \nvirtue of the direct and special impact of the Holocaust Memorial Bill on \ntheir interest in the Buxton Memorial and their forebear.\n The Thorney Island Society and Residents of Westminster \n43. The Society is a local amenity society which is concerned with an area which \nincludes VTG and the Palace of Westminster. One of the Society’s purposes \nis to secure the preservation, protection, development and improvement of \nfeatures of historic or public interest in the old Westminster village. Twenty \nindividuals are also named as petitioners in the Society’s petition. Some \nlive near VTG. Others live further away but within the SW1P and SW1V \npostcodes.\n44. The Promoter has not objected to the standing of the Society to petition \nagainst the Bill. In the exercise of our discretion under Standing Order 117(2) \nwe have considered the Society’s petition. The Promoter has not expressly \nopposed the individual co-petitioners. Insofar as it is necessary to comment \non their standing separately from the Society, the interests of such of them \nas live in the vicinity of VTG are directly and specially affected by the Bill.\n12 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n Sir Peter Bottomley and Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone\n45. Sir Peter and Baroness Bottomley have established an entitlement to have \ntheir petition considered by virtue of having lived very near VTG for many \nyears and the fact that they have always enjoyed regular use of the amenity of \nVTG. Their interests are directly and specially affected by the Bill.\n Viscount Eccles\n46. Viscount Eccles has established an entitlement to have his petition considered \nby virtue of living at, and having a property interest in, a flat very near VTG \nand enjoying the amenity of the Gardens on a regular and frequent basis \nover many years. His interests are directly and specially affected by the Bill.\n Lord Hamilton of Epsom\n47. Lord Hamilton has established an entitlement to have his petition considered \nby virtue of owning and living in a flat very near VTG and enjoying the \namenity of the Gardens on a regular and frequent basis. His interests are \ndirectly and specially affected by the Bill.\n Lord Strathclyde and his co-petitioners who inhabit a residence in the vicinity of \nVTG \n48. Lord Strathclyde and those of his co-petitioners who inhabit a residence in \nthe vicinity of VTG have established an entitlement to be heard as local \nresidents who regularly use the amenity of the Gardens. Their interests are \ndirectly and specially affected by the Bill. \n Lord Blencathra \n49. Lord Blencathra is a resident in the area.  In his oral evidence he said that, \nif successful, the proposed HMLC might affect the value of his property \ndue to large numbers of buses, car parking and demonstrations. That was a \nchange from his petition in which he said that he did not think that the value \nof his property would be affected. The Committee, nevertheless, considered \nthat he established his right to have his petition considered as he is a resident \nin the vicinity of VTG and enjoys the use of the Gardens. His interests are \ndirectly and specially affected by the Bill. \n Baroness Finlay of Llandaff \n50. Baroness Finlay established her right to have her petition considered as a \nresident in the vicinity of VTG who enjoys the use of the Gardens. Her \ninterests are directly and specially affected by the Bill. \n Baroness Deech and Holocaust survivors\n51. Baroness Deech’s petition is on her own behalf, as a descendant of Holocaust \nsurvivors, and also on behalf of six Holocaust survivors (one of whom was \nnot in a concentration camp but was hidden by foster parents).\n52. We consider that in the exceptional, probably unique, circumstances of the \npresent case, Baroness Deech and the others mentioned in her petition are \nsignificantly personally affected by the Bill and are entitled to be heard. In \nreaching this conclusion we are not persuaded by the assertion that Holocaust \nsurvivors feel that they may be blamed and will incur public disapproval \nand criticism for any adverse consequences of the Promoter’s plans for \n13 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nthe proposed HMLC in VTG. Rather, we consider that the interests of \nthe petitioners, by virtue of their particular personal experiences of the \nHolocaust either directly or as members of the families of Holocaust victims \nor survivors, are specially and directly affected by the proposed HMLC in \na way and to an extent that marks them out as a group distinct from other \nmembers of the public.\n Lord Sassoon\n53. Lord Sassoon has established a right to have his petition considered on the \nsame grounds as Baroness Deech, namely his family connections with those \nwho were victims of the Holocaust. In his case, there is the added feature of \nclosely related members of his family who helped to save Jews at the time of \nthe Holocaust. \n Lord Carlile of Berriew \n54. Lord Carlile has established a right to have his petition considered on the \nsame grounds as Baroness Deech and Lord Sassoon, namely his family \nconnection with Holocaust survivors and victims.\n Petitioners found not to have standing \n55. We decided that the following do not have standing on the basis of the general \nprinciples we have set out above. \n Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts \n56. Lord Hodgson is not an inhabitant of the area and said that his use of VTG \nhas been infrequent. He said that his petition is about the increased difficulty \nof access to the Palace of Westminster for people going to the Palace of \nWestminster during and after construction of the proposed HMLC. These \nconcerns do not confer an entitlement to be heard and, as he does not claim \nto be an inhabitant of the area near to VTG, the Standing Orders do not \nconfer on us any discretion to consider his petition.\n Lord Griffiths of Burry Port \n57. Lord Griffiths is not an inhabitant of the area. He based his right to petition \non human rights and as a member of the public. These are matters which \nconcern the public at large and not his personal interests. He does not fall \nwithin the convention of the right to be heard or within any Standing Order \nwhich confers a discretion to hear a petitioner.\n Lord Russell of Liverpool \n58. Lord Russell’s petition does not give any indication that he is an inhabitant \nof the area near to VTG, so there is no Standing Order which confers a \ndiscretion to hear him. Working in Parliament is an insufficient ground for \nentitlement to a right to be heard.\n Jardentome Ltd\n59. Jardentome Ltd owns a property near to VTG. Employees and others who \nwork there have had regular and frequent enjoyment of the Gardens. There \nis nothing in the petition and we heard no evidence that any part of the \nproperty is a residence. As in the case of parliamentarians who work in the \nPalace of Westminster, irrespective of whether or not they have a view of \n14 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nVTG from their office windows or they have enjoyed the amenity of VTG, \nworking in the vicinity of VTG together with enjoyment of VTG is an \ninsufficient ground for an entitlement to be heard. Nor is there any Standing \nOrder which confers on us a discretion to hear the petition. \n Lord Inglewood \n60. Lord Inglewood claims that his petition should be considered in the \nCommittee’s general discretion, as “a master of its own procedure”, because \nof his special interest, different from the public generally, as a former \nGovernment Minister with responsibility for architectural heritage and \nconservation, as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and as President of \nHistoric Buildings and Places (previously the Ancient Monuments Society). \nHe claims a special expertise in relation to the impact of the Holocaust \nMemorial Bill and the proposed memorial on the significance, setting and \nviews of the many historic buildings and structures in the vicinity on both \nthe north and south sides of the River Thames. He also relies on the fact \nthat he works in the Palace of Westminster and No. 1 Millbank, in offices \noverlooking VTG, and VTG is important to him, his staff and his visitors \nas a resource which is available for, among other things, calm reflection, \ndiscussion, debriefing after meetings and a place for visitors to wait. Lord \nInglewood put in evidence a letter from Historic Buildings and Places in \nsupport of his petition, including the amendments to the Bill which he seeks.\n61. As we have stated above, the Committee does not accept that it has \na completely free hand as to which petitions it considers or that it has a \ndiscretion to entertain a petition solely because the petitioner has special \nknowledge which may assist the Committee. Lord Inglewood is not a society, \nassociation or other body within Standing Order 117(2). The petition is in \nLord Inglewood’s name. It is not a petition of Historic Buildings and Places. \nHe is not an inhabitant of a residence in the vicinity of VTG within Standing \nOrder 118.  Accordingly, there is no Standing Order which confers on the \nCommittee a discretion to consider his petition.  Further, as we have also \nsaid, working in Parliament, whether with or without a view of VTG, and \nwhether or not VTG has been enjoyed as an amenity, is insufficient to found \na right to be heard.\n15 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nCHAPTER 3:  PRINCIPLE AND SCOPE\n62. In the second reading debate several members of the House appeared to view \nthe role of the Select Committee as extending to a wide review of the merits \nof the proposed HMLC for which the Secretary of State, as Promoter, has \nbeen seeking planning permission.\n63. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the function of the Select \nCommittee. The function is not to conduct a roving investigation into general \nmerits: 1948 report by the House of Commons Select Committee on Hybrid \nBills (Procedure in Committee) (Session 1947-48, HC 191, paragraph 19). \nRather, it is to protect private interests, but subject to a number of constraints. \nAs mentioned earlier, objections based on public policy are reserved for \nsubsequent stages of the legislative process – committee, report and third \nreading.\n64. The Committee has no power, in the absence of express authority from the \nHouse, to hear any evidence other than that tendered by any party entitled \nto be heard: Standing Order 124.  It cannot, therefore, call expert or other \nevidence on its own initiative.\n65. It is a long-standing convention that the Committee cannot consider any \namendments that are destructive of the “principle” of the Bill:  High Speed \nRail (London-West Midlands) Bill (Session 2016-17, HL Paper 83, paragraph \n20).\n66. For the principle of the Bill reference must be made to clauses 1 and 2, which \nare as follows so far as relevant. \n1 Expenditure relating to a Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre  \n(1) The Secretary of State may incur expenditure for or in connection \nwith—\n(a) the construction on, over or under any land of—\n(i) a memorial commemorating the victims of the Holocaust, and\n(ii) a centre for learning relating to the memorial,\n(b) the carrying out of any work ancillary to, or associated with, \nanything falling within paragraph (a), and\n(c) the use, operation, maintenance or improvement of the memorial \nand the centre for learning.\n(2) ... \n(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), “construction” includes \nerection, extension, alteration and re-erection.\n2 Removal of restrictions in relation to certain land\nSection 8(1) and (8) of the London County Council (Improvements) Act \n1900 does not prevent, restrict or otherwise affect the carrying out of any of \nthe activities described in paragraphs (a) to (c) of section 1(1) on, over, under \nor otherwise in relation to the land described in section 8(1) of that Act.\n16 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n67. Clause 3 provides that the Act extends to England and Wales. Whereas \nclause 1 has no geographical restriction other than England and Wales \n(“any land”), clause 2 is specifically directed at VTG as it removes from \nVTG the requirement in section 8(1) and (8) of the 1900 Act that VTG is \nto be maintained for use as a garden open to the public. That requirement is \nremoved to the extent necessary for the carrying out of any of the activities \ndescribed in paragraphs (a) to (c) of clause 1(1) of the Bill on, over, under \nor otherwise in relation to VTG. Expressed in more colloquial terms, the \nprinciple of clause 2 is that section 8 of the 1900 Act is not to stand in the \nway of or obstruct the building and subsequent operation of a Holocaust \nmemorial and learning centre in VTG. \n68. Mr  Brian Doctor KC, counsel for four of the petitioners, relying on the word \n“a” in the long title (“a Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre”) and in \nclause 1(1)(a)(i) and (ii) (“a memorial”, “a centre for learning”), maintained \nthat the proposed HMLC for which the Secretary of State had applied for \nplanning permission was irrelevant to the principle of the Bill as it is not \nmentioned at all in the Bill. This seems to us to be overly legalistic and \nunrealistic. We bear in mind that we are not a court of law but a committee \nof the House of Lords guided by convention. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the \nExplanatory Notes accompanying the Bill as well as the opening speech of \nLord Khan of Burnley, Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Housing, \nCommunities and Local Government, at second reading, indicate that one \nof the main purposes of the Bill is to remove the obstacle of the 1900 Act to \nthe construction and operation of the Government’s project.\n69. Those paragraphs of the Explanatory Notes are as follows.\n“7. An application for planning consent was made by the then Secretary \nof State for Housing, Communities and Local Government in December \n2018 for a Holocaust Memorial and accompanying underground \nLearning Centre. Following a public inquiry in 2020, planning consent \nwas granted in July 2021. Subsequently in a statutory review of the \nplanning decision the High Court concluded that certain sections of \nthe London County Council (Improvements) Act 1900 (‘the 1900 Act’) \nwhich extended the existing Victoria Tower Gardens southwards and \nrequired the Commissioner of Works to maintain the land as a ‘garden \nopen to the public’ were an obstacle to constructing the Holocaust \nMemorial and Learning Centre in the Gardens. The High Court \nquashed the decision to grant planning consent. \n8. The Government intends to disapply the relevant sections of the \n1900 Act so that they do not constitute an obstacle to construction and \noperation of the Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre.”\n70. As to the suggestion that, on the revival of the current planning application, \na very different project might be put forward by the Government, this again \nseems unrealistic. A significant change in the project would require a new \nplanning application, whereas it is the existing planning application which \nthe Government intends to pursue.  The fact that the Government attaches \nmuch importance to securing completion of this project while some of the \nHolocaust survivors are still alive suggests that it will not wish to encounter \nthe delay which would result if significant changes were to be made . \n17 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n71. Nevertheless, in view of the debate between counsel that took place before \nus, we shall in the alternative consider each proposed amendment without \nreference to the current project. \n72. In the House of Commons the Select Committee was given an instruction \non the Bill following second reading which specified matters that could not \nbe investigated by the Committee. Those included matters that had been or \ncould be addressed in the planning process. No instructions have been given \nin the House of Lords to this Committee.\n73. The Committee cannot make an amendment that is outside the scope of the \nBill. The scope of a bill is described by Erskine May (25th edition, 2019), \nparagraph 28.81, as the reasonable limits of its collective purposes, as defined \nby its existing clauses and schedules. Erskine May also states that when, as \nis the case here, a bill has one or two purposes, “only amendments relating \nto those purposes, or touching on matters closely connected with them, fall \nwithin the scope of the bill”.\n74. We heard considerable argument as to whether or not the Committee \ncould and should consider amendments relating to planning matters.  Mr \nKatkowski maintained that all planning matters are out of scope because \nthey are addressed by an independent body at a different stage to the removal \nof the obstacles to the construction and operation of the project addressed \nin the Bill. Mr McCracken KC, counsel for Lord Inglewood, argued that \nall such matters are in scope as they relate to limitations on the lifting of the \nprotection of section 8 of the 1900 Act. Rather than express a general view \nhere, we will consider planning, if and so far as necessary, in relation to each \nproposed amendment to the Bill. \n75. In addition to all the above constraints, the Committee has an overriding \ndiscretion not to accept an amendment to the Bill even if it is not destructive \nof the principle of the Bill and not outside the scope of the Bill.\n18 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nCHAPTER 4:  PETITIONERS’ AMENDMENTS\n76. Having heard the submissions of Mr Katkowski, Mr Doctor and Lord \nCarlile on scope and principle, we reached the provisional view that it \nwould be contrary to the principle of the Bill, even without regard for the \nGovernment’s currently intended project, for any petitioner to argue that \nthere should not be a Holocaust memorial and learning centre in VTG, that \na Holocaust memorial should not be co-located with a learning centre in \nVTG and that any learning centre should not be underground. Our view was \nprovisional only to the extent that any other unrepresented petitioner would \nbe entitled to argue that our provisional view was incorrect. Most petitioners \nrevised their request for amendments to take account of those limitations. In \nthe event, other than the further submission of Lord Carlile mentioned in \nthe next paragraph, no petitioner challenged our provisional view.\n77. Lord Carlile subsequently submitted that clause 1 of the Bill is nothing \nmore than an expression of intention or hope and therefore brings within \nscope the three areas which the Committee provisionally considered would \nbe destructive of the principle of the Bill. He relied particularly on the \nCabinet Manual 2011 paragraphs 3.2-3.32.  Mr Katkowski responded with \nreference to another doctrine applicable to public expenditure, the “Baldwin \nConcordat”. We do not consider it is necessary to set out and analyse here the \nopposing arguments in detail. It is sufficient to say that we are not persuaded \nby Lord Carlile’s argument.\n78. Aside from the three matters mentioned in paragraph 76 above, we were \nasked by petitioners to make various other amendments to the Bill or to \nsecure from the Promoter undertakings or assurances to the same effect or, \nat the least, to raise them or their subject matter in this Report. Breach of \nundertakings (see Standing Order 130) and assurances to the Committee \nwould have parliamentary and practical consequences. \n79. The issues raised were as follows.\n The Playground and access \n80. It was contended that the size of the children’s playground should not be \nreduced, that it should not be moved closer to the road, that the access to \nthe playground should not be affected and that the playground should not be \nlocated near to any Holocaust memorial and learning centre. If regard is had \nto the Government’s currently intended project but the location and size of \nthe playground were to stay the same, it seems that the consequence would be \nto move the proposed HMLC northwards and so leave even less of the open \nspace of the Gardens. This would be destructive of the principle of the Bill. \nIf the current project is not taken into account, we do not have the technical \nexpertise, evidence or resources to be able to say to what extent, and in what \nway, this would have an impact on the construction of a Holocaust memorial \nand learning centre.\n81. We agree, however, with some of the petitioners that the current proposals \nfor use of, and access to, the playground and indeed VTG generally by those \nwho wish to enjoy the Gardens, rather than visit the proposed HMLC, are \nunclear and inadequate. The position has to be judged before and after \nconstruction.\n19 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n82. The playground is popular with local residents, who have young children and \ngrandchildren. We sought an assurance that during construction interference \nwith the playground is kept to a minimum. The Promoter has responded with \nan assurance  (Assurance 1) to the Committee that, during construction of \nthe proposed HMLC, closures of and other interference with the children’s \nplayground at the south end of VTG will be kept to a minimum by the \nPromoter and its contractors adopting the following measures:\n(a) throughout the construction of the proposed HMLC the playground \nwill be kept open at all times when it is practicable and safe to do so;\n(b) during the construction phase, reasonable care will be taken to avoid \nany mud or dust reaching the playground from the construction site \nand for most of that phase the main construction work will take place \nbehind hoardings;\n(c) whenever the playground is open during the construction phase, level \naccess will be maintained from the gate at the northern end of VTG \n(via the riverside path) as well as access via the steps at the south of \nVTG on the western end of Lambeth Bridge; and\n(d) during the construction phase the Promoter will require contractors to \nshare with users of VTG and the local community information about \nthe progress of construction, with planned closures of the playground \nnotified to them in advance.\n83. Although it is the Promoter’s intention that step-free access will be maintained \nfrom the gate at the northern end of VTG (via the riverside path), this is a \nvery lengthy route for those coming from the south.  In relation to this point \nthe Promoter has given to the Committee an assurance  (Assurance 2) that \nboth during and after construction of the proposed HMLC:\n(a) although closure of the southern gate from Millbank into VTG will be \nrequired at some points during the construction stage for the proposed \nHMLC, the Promoter will seek to maintain safe access through that \ngate for as much time during construction as possible; and\n(b) after the construction period the Promoter has no intention of closing \nany of the existing gates providing access to VTG.  Visitors to the \nplayground will therefore be able to enter VTG at the step-free southern \ngate from Millbank, directly into the playground.\n84. So far as concerns the use of VTG generally for normal recreational use \nduring the construction period, the Promoter has given to the Committee an \nassurance  (Assurance 3) that during construction of the proposed HMLC \nthe Promoter will ensure, so far as reasonably practicable and health and \nsafety considerations allow, but excepting factors beyond the Promoter’s \ncontrol (such as adverse weather conditions), that restrictions on access by \nthe public to VTG will be kept to a minimum and that, in particular, the \nPromoter will keep a footpath along the River Thames of at least 1.5 metres \nin width open whenever reasonably practicable and where The Royal Parks \n(responsible for managing VTG) are content. The Promoter will require any \ncontractor appointed to construct the proposed HMLC to adhere to this \nassurance.\n20 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n85. It is also a matter of concern that, after construction of the currently proposed \nproject, those wishing to gain access to, and use, the playground will have \nto mingle with very large numbers of people visiting and exiting from the \nproposed HMLC (estimated in the current planning application to be as \nmany as 10,000 each day). The same is true of those who wish to use VTG \nfor ordinary recreational purposes but cannot navigate steps and so will have \nto mingle with very large numbers of people visiting the proposed HMLC \nat the northern entry point, especially if visitors to the proposed HMLC \nare required to queue on any of the paths. We are particularly concerned \nthat insufficient attention has been devoted to the issue of young children \nin the playground being in close proximity to adults visiting the proposed \nHMLC, whether exiting from HMLC or using the public toilets and the \nproposed kiosk. In response to our concerns, the Promoter has given to the \nCommittee the following assurances . The first assurance  (Assurance 4) \nis that a review will be carried out with the design team of the arrangements \nproposed for the southern end of VTG, with a view to ensuring an appropriate \nseparation of the playground from other visitors to VTG, including visitors \nto the proposed HMLC.  Measures to be considered during that review will \ninclude:\n(a) very clear delineation of the boundaries of the playground, using the \nSpicer Memorial, hedges and other planting to make the playground \nspace clearly separate from the area around the proposed HMLC;\n(b) ensuring that visitors to the proposed HMLC have no need to pass \nthrough the playground; and\n(c) ensuring that visitors to VTG, whether visiting the proposed HMLC \nor not, have no need to pass through the playground in order to access \neither the public toilets or the refreshment kiosk. \nThe second assurance  (Assurance 5) is that, after the construction period, \nthere is no intention of the proposed HMLC requiring closure of any of the \nexisting gates providing access to VTG, and so visitors to the playground will \nbe able to enter VTG at the step-free southern gate from Millbank, directly \ninto the playground; and similarly, visitors to VTG who are not intending to \nuse the playground or to visit the proposed HMLC will be free to enter via \nany of the gates from Millbank, as now.\n86. We were informed by the Promoter’s Parliamentary Agents that security \nchecks will take place only on visitors wishing to access the entrance pavilion \nat the proposed HMLC, and that there is no intention to restrict access to \nother areas of VTG or to carry out security checks on users of VTG who are \nnot intending to visit the proposed HMLC.  On this issue, the Promoter has \ngiven to the Committee an assurance  (Assurance 6) that the Promoter has \nno intention to request or arrange for security checks to be carried out on \nvisitors to VTG who do not intend to enter the proposed HMLC, and that it \nhas no intention to request or arrange for access by members of the public to \nother areas of VTG to be restricted on security grounds. \n The Kiosk \n87. The plans for the proposed HMLC show a kiosk at the southern end of \nVTG, near to the children’s playground. There is currently a kiosk further \nnorth which, we were informed, was previously operated under a franchise \nissued by The Royal Parks for many years, was closed in the autumn of 2019, \n21 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nreopened for the summer season in 2021, and closed again in September \n2021.  It has remained closed since then. Some petitioners said that there \nshould be no food and drink sales anywhere in VTG if a memorial is sited \nthere, not only because the sale of snacks would be deeply disrespectful in \nthe vicinity of a memorial to people who starved to death, but also because \nof litter and crowding. Those are not only matters of public policy, outside \nour remit but, by extending the restriction to the whole of VTG, lie outside \nthe scope of the Bill.\n88. Our principal concern about the proposed new kiosk is rather different: the \ncongregation of very large numbers of visitors to the proposed HMLC at the \nproposed new kiosk immediately adjacent to the playground. This raises child \nsafety issues.   Unless there is some overriding necessity for the proposed \nnew kiosk, we recommend  (Recommendation 1) that the Secretary of State \nshould remove it from the present plans.\n Siting of structures for a Holocaust memorial and learning centre \nwithin VTG \n89. On this issue the Promoter was willing to give the following assurance  \n(Assurance 7) to the Committee:\n(1) Although clause 2 of the Bill applies to the whole of VTG, the \nPromoter will only site the permanent buildings and other permanent \nstructures comprising a Holocaust memorial and learning centre and \nits ancillary facilities (the permanent elements) on, under and over the \nland (a) permitted by any planning permission that is granted by the \nSecretary of State shown coloured blue and edged in blue on the plan \nin Appendix 6; or (b) permitted by any planning permission for an \nextended, altered, modified or replacement scheme for a Holocaust \nmemorial and learning centre.\n(2) In paragraph (1)(b), “planning permission” means a planning \npermission granted under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, \na planning permission changed in accordance with section 96A of that \nAct (power to make non-material changes to planning permission), \nor a planning permission modified by a further planning permission \ngranted under section 73 or 73A of that Act (in relation to which \ncertain consultation and publicity obligations on the local planning \nauthority arise).\n(3) The Promoter will require any contractor appointed to construct a \nHolocaust memorial and learning centre to adhere to the assurance \ngiven in paragraph (1).\n90. The Committee appreciates that paragraph 1(b) is capable of negating the \nassurance in (1)(a) but, in the absence of any willingness on the part of the \nPromoter to limit it to, for example, non-material extensions, modifications \nand alterations, there is nothing more that the Committee can do. The \nCommittee does not have the knowledge or expertise to fix where the \npermanent buildings and other structures should be sited within VTG. The \nCommittee, therefore, accepts the assurance as proffered but with regret \nthat a more satisfactory undertaking, from the perspective of those residents \nusing VTG for recreation, could not be secured from the Promoter. \n22 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n Design of the proposed HMLC \n91. Criticism was made of the design of the proposed HMLC as well as its \nassociation with the designer Sir David Adjaye. These are matters of public \npolicy, outside the remit of the Committee, and not private interests, whose \nprotection is the principal concern of the Committee. \n Proposed Learning Centre and the Parliamentary Education Centre \n92. Considerable concern was expressed about the proposed Learning Centre. \nIn particular, it was said that it would not be in keeping with the way young \npeople learn today. It was also said that the proposed Learning Centre would \nbear no relationship to the original understanding in Prime Minister David \nCameron’s 2015 Holocaust Commission report. That report recommended \nthat the memorial should be co-located with a world-class and substantial \nlearning centre at the heart of a campus driving a network of national \neducational activity. The currently proposed Learning Centre is said to be \nmuch diminished, and without the most important educational elements that \nwere originally recommended. One petitioner, by contrast, said both that \nonly a fraction of school children would visit a physical building and also \nthat the present limited proposal for a video learning centre was out of date \neven in 2015. Again, by contrast, it was said by at least one petitioner that the \nLearning Centre should not engage in any activities on its own but should \nbe an enabling institution supporting existing research and educational \ninstitutions which study the Holocaust and related subjects.\n93. It was also said that there should be an amendment providing for an annual \nindex-linked budget starting at £50 million for continuous and up-dated \nteaching of the 1940s Holocaust and countering antisemitism sweeping the \nUnited Kingdom. There was also a criticism that the project has wrongly \nbeen diverted into a project about British values and the ‘trite message’ \nthat democracy will protect against genocide - a monument to British self-\nreflection, not a memorial and learning centre. All of the above are matters \nof public policy rather than private interests, and so outside the scope of the \nCommittee.\n94. It was contended that the Parliamentary Education Centre could be the \nsite of an appropriate Holocaust learning centre. If regard is had to the \nGovernment’s currently intended project, this would plainly be destructive \nof the principle of the Bill. If that project is not taken into account, we lack \nthe expertise, evidence and resources to express a view on the viability and \nappropriateness of the use of the Education Centre as a Holocaust learning \ncentre. In any event, the evidence was that during the period of Restoration \nand Renewal of the Palace of Westminster (R&R) the Education Centre \nwould have to be given up in its present location and would, potentially, be \nrelocated within the Palace, possibly underground. \n Height, size and bulk of a Holocaust Memorial \n95. It was contended that a memorial should be of a height, size and bulk no \ngreater than any of the existing memorials in VTG. If regard is had to the \nGovernment’s currently intended project, this would plainly be destructive \nof the principle of the Bill. If that project is not taken into account, the \nargument would still significantly restrain the powers of the Secretary of State \nunder clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill. Nor do we have the expertise, evidence or \nresources to say whether it would be viable to have above ground a memorial \n23 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nwhich does not exceed the height, size and bulk of the other memorials in \nVTG with an underground learning centre below it.\n96. There is a further proposed amendment along similar lines to provide that \nany Holocaust memorial and learning centre should not (a) result in the \nraising of the current ground level or (b) exceed 9.62 metres in height above \nthe current ground level. Our view on this proposal is the same as for the \namendment considered in the preceding paragraph. Our comments below \non proposed amendments relating to the Buxton Memorial are also relevant. \n97. It was also contended that any memorial and learning centre should not \noccupy a surface area greater than 1,429 sq. metres, including in that total \narea any entrance pavilion, courtyard and ramp into the learning centre, \nassociated hard standing, service access, new access paths, the parts of the \nmound not accessible to the public and areas enclosed to ensure the security \nof the memorial and learning centre. We were told that this was the wording \nof the assurance given by Baroness Scott of Bybrook in her Parliamentary \nAnswer to HL6914 tabled on 28 March 2023 (amended on 12 April 2023) \nregarding the proposed size of the land to be taken from VTG. We do not \nconsider that it is appropriate for us to make such an amendment. The \nmeasurement is extremely precise. We do not know whether it accords or will \naccord with what the Promoter seeks in the revived planning application. It \nleaves no leeway for any extension as permitted by clause 1(3) of the Bill. \n View of the Palace of Westminster from VTG \n98. It was contended that a Holocaust memorial should not cause harm to \nthe view of the Palace of Westminster from VTG. If regard is had to the \nGovernment’s currently intended project, such a restriction would plainly be \ndestructive of the principle of the Bill. If no account is taken of that project, \nwe do not have the expertise, evidence or resources to assess the extent to \nwhich the powers under clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill would be constrained. \nThat constraint would clearly be considerable. \n The setting of the Buxton Memorial and other memorials \n99. An amendment was proposed by a number of petitioners that the construction \nand operation of a Holocaust memorial and learning centre should preserve \nor enhance any other memorial or the setting of such a memorial in VTG. \nWe address in detail below the impact on the Buxton Memorial of the present \nGovernment proposals, which is the subject of the Buxton petition. So far as \nother memorials are concerned, the consequences for them of clause 2 of the \nBill is a matter of public policy rather than private interests, which are the \nprimary concern of this Committee. Further, so far as concerns the Spicer \nMemorial, leaving it in its present position would be inconsistent with the \nGovernment’s present proposals and so would be destructive of the principle \nof the Bill. If no regard is paid to the presently proposed HMLC, we do \nnot have the expertise, evidence or resources to say how much the powers \nin clause 2 of the Bill would be constrained if the Spicer Memorial were to \nremain in its present location. \n100. The Buxton Memorial, a Grade II* building in VTG, commemorates Sir \nThomas Fowell Buxton and other slavery abolitionists, whose campaign \nled to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. It is an important national memorial, \nwhich was erected in 1865-1866 in Parliament Square and moved to VTG \nin 1957. \n24 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n101. The Buxton petitioners and other petitioners are concerned that the proposed \nHMLC should not damage the Buxton Memorial or its setting. The Planning \nInspector acknowledged that the planning application would cause great \nand important harm to the setting of the Buxton Memorial, albeit less than \nsubstantial harm, carrying considerable weight in the heritage balance. The \nInspector concluded, however, that the heritage balance nevertheless clearly \nand demonstrably weighs in favour of the planning proposals.\n102. The Buxton petitioners are particularly concerned that there will only be \na gap of 1.5-2 metres between the Buxton Memorial and security fencing \nthat is to be installed around the proposed HMLC.  They contend that \nit would be difficult for people to appreciate the Buxton Memorial from \nthat distance, and it would also result in a real pinch point on the adjoining \npathway. The petitioners suggest a greater separation distance between the \nBuxton Memorial and the proposed HMLC and any security fencing to \nenable easier passage and better viewing of the Buxton Memorial by those \nvisiting VTG. In response to these concerns, the Promoter has given the \nCommittee an assurance  (Assurance 8) that detailed consideration will be \ngiven to the question of how easily visitors to the proposed HMLC, and \nto VTG generally, will be able to pass by and view the Buxton Memorial, \nincluding by considering the location, nature, specification and design of \npaths, fencing and other boundary treatments.\n103. The Buxton petitioners also  seek an amendment to the Bill that the \nconstruction and use of a Holocaust memorial and learning centre, including \nthe one presently proposed, must not cause any harm to the fabric or setting \nof the Buxton Memorial. So far as concerns the presently proposed HMLC, \nsuch an amendment is inevitably destructive of the principle of the Bill as the \nPlanning Inspector concluded that the setting of the Buxton Memorial will \nbe harmed. More generally, unlike the Planning Inspector, we do not have \nthe expertise, evidence or resources to understand precisely what impact \nsuch an amendment would have on the location, configuration and size of \nany Holocaust memorial and co-located learning centre and access to them.\n Closure dates \n104. Some petitioners wish the Bill to be amended to set a limit on the amount of \ntime that VTG can be closed to the public in any one year in consequence \nof events associated with the proposed HMLC. This is a matter which \nparticularly affects residents who habitually visit and use VTG for relaxation \nand enjoyment. The limitation of closure dates seems to us to be a \nreasonable request. It is not appropriate for an amendment to the Bill or an \nundertaking but is probably best addressed in byelaws applicable to VTG.  \nWe recommend  (Recommendation 2) that this be taken forward by The \nRoyal Parks, which is and will be the body responsible for maintenance of \nthose parts of VTG outside the perimeter of the proposed HMLC. \n Continuing application of section 8 of the 1900 Act to VTG \n105. We agree with the view expressed by some petitioners that the protection of \nVTG by the 1900 Act should continue to apply to any part of the Gardens \nnot taken up with a Holocaust memorial and learning centre, including \nthe current proposed project, after it has been fully completed and open \nto the public. The Promoter’s view is that no amendment is necessary to \naddress this issue because the Bill, as drafted, does not remove the existing \nprotection of the 1900 Act across the whole of VTG, except in relation to \n25 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nthe construction, maintenance and operation of a Holocaust memorial and \nlearning centre, so that protection will otherwise continue to apply without \nany amendment. Clause 1(3) provides that the word “construction” in clause \n1(1)(a) includes extension, alteration and re-erection, and the Promoter has \nsought to address this at paragraph (1)(b) of its assurance in paragraph 89 \nabove. We have described, in paragraph 90, that part of its assurance as \nunsatisfactory but, for the reasons given there, we have no alternative but to \naccept the assurance as proffered.\n106. We do not consider it appropriate that we should amend the Bill to include, \nas requested by some petitioners, a provision that clause 2 will cease to have \neffect at the end of 2029, except for the use, maintenance and operation of \nany buildings already completed or under construction pursuant to clause 2. \nWe heard no expert evidence on the time needed to complete the proposed \nHMLC. There is no allowance in the proposed amendment for delays due \nto matters beyond the control of the Promoter. Further, it is impossible to \npredict the full practical consequences of such a provision, which could \nresult in unusable structures left in VTG.\n Security \n107. We agree with the anxiety about security expressed by a number of petitioners. \nThis concerns private interests as well as public policy as it particularly \naffects local residents who habitually take advantage of VTG whether alone \nor with children.  In particular, we take note of the evidence of Lord Carlile \nof Berriew, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation from 2001-\n2011 and a private sector consultant on terrorism issues. He said that the site \nproposed at VTG for the currently proposed HMLC presents a very real \nterrorism risk. He elaborated in his petition as follows: \n“11. Recent events in Israel/Palestine cannot be ignored. They have \nheightened the danger of action against Jewish interests in London, and \nmay have diluted public support for placing the proposed centre so close \nto the Palace of Westminster. Recent terrorism arrests associated with \nthe Stock Exchange provide an example of the changing landscape of \nLondon terrorism. \n…\n16. In sum, in my judgement there is a real and present and serious \nprospect that the site would be regarded as iconic and tempting by both \nIslamist and right-wing extremists, given its proximity to the Palace of \nWestminster, the lack of any secure or meaningful perimeter, and its close \nproximity both to busy public highways and the river. I am astonished \nthat this has not been seen to be a real problem, and believe the time has \ncome when this warning should be taken seriously. Much has changed \non the security risk front since the original planning application was \ndetermined.\n17. I agree that we should be prepared to stand up to terrorism; but in \nthis instance the doubly iconic nature of the site would render the risk \ndisproportionate.\n18. I do not wish to be the person saying ‘I told you so’ in the foreseeable \nevent of a terrorism outrage or attempt.”\n26 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n108. We accept the view of Lord Carlile and other petitioners that it is imperative \nto recognise that the threat of terrorism activity here and abroad is much \ngreater than when the Planning Inspector wrote his report, and that much of \nwhat was said about security to the Inspector will now be out of date. \n109. Mr Katkowski was emphatic that, on the revival of the planning application, \nthe Promoter would be bound to take into account any changes in security \nconsiderations, especially the increase in terrorism threats. Lord Carlile has \nprepared possible security amendments to this Bill set out in Appendix 8  to \nthis Report. His draft amendments are important as, among other things, \nthey will enable parliamentarians, who are extremely concerned about \npotential terrorist activities in or near to VTG, to see the security proposals \n(subject to removal from sight of matters which cannot be disclosed for \nreasons of confidentiality and sensitivity) before the Act is brought into \nforce. We recommend  (Recommendation 3) that the Secretary of State \ngives serious consideration to those amendments or something similar. The \nPromoter has agreed  that will be done.\n110. In addition, the Promoter has given the following undertaking:\n(1) Following re-activation by the Secretary of State of the planning \nprocess in relation to the current planning application, the Promoter \nwill make representations to the Secretary of State in relation to \nsecurity considerations and in so doing will provide updated evidence \non security considerations with the aim of ensuring that the Secretary \nof State continues to regard security considerations as a main issue in \ndetermination of the application.\n(2) Before submitting to the Secretary of State any representations on \nsecurity considerations, the Promoter will consult with the Corporate \nOfficer of the House of Commons and the Corporate Officer of \nthe House of Lords, Community Security Trust, the Metropolitan \nPolice, the National Protective Security Authority and Westminster \nCity Council, and will have regard to any comments they may make \nto the Promoter on security considerations and the Promoter will \nforward those comments to the Secretary of State when making any \nrepresentations on security considerations.\n(3) The Promoter will make available to MPs and to members of the House \nof Lords the Promoter’s representations to the Secretary of State in \nrelation to security considerations, including the Promoter’s updated \nevidence, by depositing in the Library of the House of Commons and \nthe Library of the House of Lords all such representations except any \nthat are confidential or which should not be placed in the public domain \nfor security reasons. \n(4) In this undertaking, the reference to the Secretary of State is a reference \nto the Minister of State determining the application under delegation \nfrom the Secretary of State and in accordance with the functional \nseparation arrangements in place. \n111. The Promoter has also given an assurance  (Assurance 9) to the Committee \nthat,  as soon as practicable following re-activation by the Secretary of State \nof the planning process in relation to the current planning application, \nthe Promoter will publicise this and the anticipated timetable by notifying \n27 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n(a) MPs and members of the House of Lords, through the Library of the \nHouse of Commons and the Library of the House of Lords; (b) the London \nHistoric Parks and Gardens Trust, the Thomas Fowell Buxton Society and \nthe Thorney Island Society; and (c) organisations representing Holocaust \nsurvivors and refugees, and organisations engaged in Holocaust remembrance \nand education.  The Promoter will also take steps to notify local residents \nthrough the local press and other routes. The Promoter will similarly take \nsteps to ensure that the availability of updated information relating to the \nplanning application and submitted by the Promoter (including updated \ninformation relating to security, as far as such information can safely be \nplaced in the public domain) is notified to the parties referred to in (b) and \n(c) above, and to local residents, once it has been published by the Secretary \nof State as part of the reactivated planning process.\n Operating costs and financial sustainability \n112. Some petitioners have asked for public reporting on the capital and operating \ncosts of the currently proposed project and the financial sustainability of the \nbody managing the project. This is outside the scope of the Committee as it \nrelates to public policy and not the protection of private interests.\n Separate entities for managing the proposed HMLC and the \nremaining parts of VTG \n113. There is a reasonable concern that the interests of any Holocaust memorial \nand learning centre should not have preference over users of VTG. VTG \nis currently managed by The Royal Parks. Although it has been stated in \na letter from the Promoter’s Parliamentary Agents that it is intended that \nan independent body will have responsibility for the proposed HMLC, no \nsuch body has yet been appointed or identified.  The Promoter has given the \nCommittee an assurance  (Assurance 10) that the Promoter’s intention is for \nthe remit of any permanent independent body that is established to operate \nand run the proposed HMLC to be limited to the area of VTG occupied and \nused by the proposed HMLC. \n114. The Thorney Island Society put forward a late proposed amendment that \nany body responsible for VTG shall consult in advance with local residents \nthrough the relevant local amenity societies with regard to any matter which \nmay affect the free use of VTG as a garden open to the public. We do not \nhave any evidence from The Royal Parks or the Department for Culture, \nMedia and Sport (DCMS) (within whose remit The Royal Parks operates) \non this issue and so do not consider we can amend the Bill to address it.  It \nis likely that it would be a matter to be addressed, if The Royal Parks or \nDCMS agreed, in the byelaws relating to VTG. \n Restoration and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster \n115. Petitioners contended and gave evidence that the repair of Victoria Tower, \nR&R and the construction of the proposed HMLC would together make \nany use and enjoyment of VTG impossible in practice. This does not seem \nto have been raised before the Planning Inspector, although we were told by \ncounsel for the Promoter that there are regular meetings between the project \nteam for the proposed HMLC and also for R&R, at which information is \nshared and plans are co-ordinated.  We are not aware of anyone attending \nthose meetings who is there to represent the interests of local residents who \n28 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nuse and enjoy the Gardens. Moreover, no final decisions have yet been taken \non the R&R programme and how it will go forward. \n116. Evidence was given to us that all the potential plans for R&R involve the use \nof a significant part of VTG as the main area for keeping all the equipment \nand for access to the Palace. The evidence was that a significant part of the \narea of VTG at its northern end would be affected.\n117. There is plainly an important issue of the timing of the different projects as \nthe evidence was that the main R&R works would not begin before 2029 at \nthe earliest.   We do not have the expertise, evidence or resources to express \na firm view about this issue, but we recommend  (Recommendation 4) \nthat before the Promoter submits its representations (including updated \nevidence) to the Minister following re-activation of the planning process \nfor the proposed HMLC detailed consideration is given by the Promoter as \nto how the construction and operation of the proposed HMLC and R&R \nwill interact with each other, and accommodate the use of VTG by nearby \nresidents and their children.\n118. Finally, it is to be noted that the issue of access to, and use of, the proposed \nHMLC will remain even after the completion of the proposed HMLC if \nR&R will result in a significant part of the northern part of VTG being used \nfor the storage of materials and other purposes associated with R&R. We \nheard evidence that, on one scenario, the use of the northern part of VTG \nfor R&R might continue for as long as 30 years. \n General \n119. All of the above assurances  and the  undertaking  given by the Promoter \nare understandably intended to supplement any steps required to be taken \nunder conditions attached to any planning permission for the proposed \nHMLC rather than to replace them.  This means that, should there be any \nconflict between any assurance or undertaking and the requirements of any \nsuch planning condition, the requirements of the planning condition will \ntake precedence. \n120. The Committee requested the Promoter to agree that all assurances  and the \nundertaking  in relation to the proposed HMLC will also apply to any other \nHolocaust memorial and learning centre in VTG. The Promoter was not \nwilling to agree. Nor was the Promoter willing to agree a narrower request \nthat all assurances and the undertaking in relation to the proposed HMLC \nwill also apply to any other Holocaust memorial and learning centre in VTG \nunless there are planning or other practical difficulties in implementing \nthem in the new scheme. The most that the Promoter is willing to agree \nis that the Promoter gives an assurance  (Assurance 11) to the Committee \nthat, in the event the currently proposed scheme is not granted planning \nconsent, in formulating any replacement proposal brought forward in place \nof the currently proposed scheme, the Promoter will, to the extent relevant \nto the replacement proposal, give careful attention to the issues highlighted \nby the Committee as reflected in the assurances and the undertaking given.\n29 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nAPPENDI x 1:  IMAGE OF THE PROPOSED HMLC\n\n30 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nAPPENDI x 2:  PLAN OF VTG AFTER CONSTRUCTION\n\n31 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nAPPENDI x 3:  TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (INQUIRIES \nPROCEDURE) (ENGLAND) RULES 2000\nRule 19 \nProcedure following quashing of decision \n19 (1) Where a decision of the Secretary of State on an application or appeal in \nrespect of which an inquiry has been held is quashed in proceedings before any \ncourt, the Secretary of State—\n(a) shall send to the persons entitled to appear at the inquiry who appeared \nat it a written statement of the matters with respect to which further \nrepresentations are invited for the purposes of his further consideration \nof the application or appeal;\n(b) shall afford to those persons the opportunity of making written \nrepresentations to him in respect of those matters or of asking for the \nre-opening of the inquiry; and\n(c) may, as he thinks fit, cause the inquiry to be re-opened (whether by the \nsame or a different inspector) … \n32 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nAPPENDI x 4:  PETITIONERS\n(1) Lord Carlile of Berriew \n(2) Lord Hamilton of Epsom \n(3) Lord Strathcarron \n(4) Lord Griffiths of Burry Port \n(5) Lord Russell of Liverpool \n(6) Lord Sassoon \n(7) Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts \n(8) Baroness Finlay of Llandaff \n(9) Lord Inglewood \n(10) Viscount Eccles \n(11) Baroness Deech and Holocaust survivors  \n(12) London Historic Parks and Gardens Trust \n(13) Buxton Family and the Thomas Fowell Buxton Society \n(14) Lord Strathclyde and other members of the House of Lords \n(15) Thorney Island Society and residents of Westminster \n(16) Jardentome Ltd \n(17) Sir Peter Bottomley and Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone \n(18) Lord Blencathra \n33 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nAPPENDI x 5:  BRIEF SUMMARY OF ASSURANCES, \nRECOMMENDATIONS AND AN UNDERTAKING\nParagraph numbers in parenthesis refer to paragraphs of this Report. \n The Playground and access\n Assurance 1 (paragraph 82) \nWe sought an assurance that during construction interference with the playground \nis kept to a minimum. The Promoter has responded with an assurance  to the \nCommittee that, during construction of the proposed HMLC, closures of and \nother interference with the children’s playground at the south end of VTG will \nbe kept to a minimum by the Promoter and its contractors adopting the following \nmeasures:\n(a) throughout the construction of the proposed HMLC the playground \nwill be kept open at all times when it is practicable and safe to do so;\n(b) during the construction phase, reasonable care will be taken to avoid \nany mud or dust reaching the playground from the construction site \nand for most of that phase the main construction work will take place \nbehind hoardings;\n(c) whenever the playground is open during the construction phase, level \naccess will be maintained from the gate at the northern end of VTG \n(via the riverside path) as well as access via the steps at the south of \nVTG on the western end of Lambeth Bridge; and\n(d) during the construction phase the Promoter will require contractors to \nshare with users of VTG and the local community information about \nthe progress of construction, with planned closures of the playground \nnotified to them in advance. \n Assurance 2 (paragraph 83)\nAlthough it is the Promoter’s intention that step-free access will be maintained \nfrom the gate at the northern end of VTG (via the riverside path), this is a very \nlengthy route for those coming from the south.  In relation to this point the \nPromoter has given to the Committee an assurance  that:\n(a) although closure of the southern gate from Millbank into VTG will be \nrequired at some points during the construction stage for the proposed \nHMLC, the Promoter will seek to maintain safe access through that \ngate for as much time during construction as possible; and \n(b) after the construction period the Promoter has no intention of closing \nany of the existing gates providing access to VTG.  Visitors to the \nplayground will therefore be able to enter VTG at the step-free southern \ngate from Millbank, directly into the playground. \n Assurance 3 (paragraph 84)\nSo far as concerns the use of VTG generally for normal recreational use during \nthe construction period, the Promoter has given the Committee an assurance  \nthat during construction of the proposed HMLC the Promoter will ensure, so far \nas reasonably practicable and health and safety considerations allow, but excepting \nfactors beyond the Promoter’s control (such as adverse weather conditions), that \nrestrictions on access by the public to VTG will be kept to a minimum and that, \n34 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nin particular, the Promoter will keep a footpath along the River Thames of at least \n1.5 metres in width open whenever reasonably practicable and where The Royal \nParks (responsible for managing VTG) are content. The Promoter will require \nany contractor appointed to construct the proposed HMLC to adhere to this \nassurance.\n Assurance 4 (paragraph 85) \nThe Promoter has given to the Committee an assurance  that a review will be \ncarried out with the design team of the arrangements proposed for the southern \nend of VTG, with a view to ensuring an appropriate separation of the playground \nfrom other visitors to VTG, including visitors to the proposed HMLC. Measures \nto be considered during that review will include the following:\n(a) very clear delineation of the boundaries of the playground, using the \nSpicer Memorial, hedges and other planting to make the playground \nspace clearly separate from the area around the proposed HMLC;\n(b) ensuring that visitors to the proposed HMLC have no need to pass \nthrough the playground; and\n(c) ensuring that visitors to VTG, whether visiting the proposed HMLC \nor not, have no need to pass through the playground in order to access \neither the public toilets or the refreshment kiosk. \n Assurance 5 (paragraph 85) \nThe Promoter has given an assurance  to the Committee that, after the construction \nperiod, there is no intention of the proposed HMLC requiring closure of any of \nthe existing gates providing access to VTG, and so visitors to the playground will \nbe able to enter VTG at the step-free southern gate from Millbank, directly into \nthe playground; and similarly, visitors to VTG who are not intending to use the \nplayground or to visit the proposed HMLC will be free to enter via any of the \ngates from Millbank, as now.\n Assurance 6 (paragraph 86) \nThe Promoter has given an assurance  to the Committee that the Promoter has no \nintention to request or arrange for security checks to be carried out on visitors to \nVTG who do not intend to enter the proposed HMLC and that it has no intention \nto request or arrange for access by members of the public to other areas of VTG to \nbe restricted on security grounds.\n The Kiosk \n Recommendation 1 (paragraph 88) \nThe proposed new kiosk immediately adjacent to the playground raises child safety \nissues. Unless there is some overriding necessity for the proposed new kiosk, we \nrecommend  that the Secretary of State should remove it from the present plans.\n Siting of structures for a Holocaust memorial and learning centre within \nVTG \n Assurance 7 (paragraph 89) \nOn this issue the Promoter was willing to give the following assurance  to the \nCommittee: \n35 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n(1) Although clause 2 of the Bill applies to the whole of VTG, the \nPromoter will only site the permanent buildings and other permanent \nstructures comprising a Holocaust memorial and learning centre and \nits ancillary facilities (the permanent elements) on, under and over the \nland (a) permitted by any planning permission that is granted by the \nSecretary of State shown coloured blue and edged in blue on the plan \nin Appendix 6; or (b) permitted by any planning permission for an \nextended, altered, modified or replacement scheme for a Holocaust \nmemorial and learning centre.\n(2) In paragraph (1)(b), “planning permission” means a planning \npermission granted under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, \na planning permission changed in accordance with section 96A of \nthat Act, or a planning permission modified by a further planning \npermission granted under section 73 or 73A of that Act (in relation \nto which certain consultation and publicity obligations on the local \nplanning authority arise).\n(3) The Promoter will require any contractor appointed to construct a \nHolocaust memorial and learning centre to adhere to the assurance \ngiven in paragraph (1).\n The setting of the Buxton Memorial and other memorials \n Assurance 8 (paragraph 102) \nThe Promoter has given the Committee an assurance  that  detailed consideration \nwill be given to the question of how easily visitors to the proposed HMLC, and to \nVTG generally, will be able to pass by and view the Buxton Memorial, including \nby considering the location, nature, specification and design of paths, fencing and \nother boundary treatments.\n Closure dates \n Recommendation 2 (paragraph 104) \nWe recommend  that a limit on the amount of time that VTG can be closed to \nthe public in any one year in consequence of events associated with the proposed \nHMLC, which is probably best addressed in byelaws applicable to VTG, be \ntaken forward by The Royal Parks, as that is and will be the body responsible for \nmaintenance of those parts of VTG outside the perimeter of the proposed HMLC.\n Security \n Recommendation 3 (paragraph 109) \nWe recommend  that the Secretary of State gives serious consideration to the \nproposed security amendments to the Bill prepared by Lord Carlile, which are set \nout in Appendix 8 to this Report or something similar. The Promoter has agreed \nthat will be done.\n Undertaking (paragraph 110) \nIn addition, the Promoter has given the following undertaking: \n(1) Following re-activation by the Secretary of State of the planning \nprocess in relation to the current planning application, the Promoter \nwill make representations to the Secretary of State in relation to \n36 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nsecurity considerations and in so doing will provide updated evidence \non security considerations with the aim of ensuring that the Secretary \nof State continues to regard security considerations as a main issue in \ndetermination of the application.\n(2) Before submitting to the Secretary of State any representations on \nsecurity considerations, the Promoter will consult with the Corporate \nOfficer of the House of Commons and the Corporate Officer of the \nHouse of Lords, Community Security Trust, the Metropolitan Police, \nthe National Protective Security Authority and Westminster City \nCouncil, and will have regard to any comments they may make to the \nPromoter on security considerations. The Promoter will forward those \ncomments to the Secretary of State when making any representations \non security considerations.\n(3) The Promoter will make available to MPs and to members of the House \nof Lords the Promoter’s representations to the Secretary of State in \nrelation to security considerations, including the Promoter’s updated \nevidence, by depositing in the Library of the House of Commons and \nthe Library of the House of Lords all such representations except any \nthat are confidential or which should not be placed in the public domain \nfor security reasons. \n(4) In this undertaking, the reference to the Secretary of State is a reference \nto the Minister of State determining the application under delegation \nfrom the Secretary of State and in accordance with the functional \nseparation arrangements in place.\n Assurance 9 (paragraph 111) \nThe Promoter has also given an assurance  to the Committee that,  as soon \nas practicable following re-activation by the Secretary of State of the planning \nprocess in relation to the current planning application, the Promoter will publicise \nthis and the anticipated timetable by notifying (a) MPs and members of the House \nof Lords, through the Library of the House of Commons and the Library of the \nHouse of Lords; (b) the London Historic Parks and Gardens Trust, the Thomas \nFowell Buxton Society and the Thorney Island Society; and (c) organisations \nrepresenting Holocaust survivors and refugees, and organisations engaged in \nHolocaust remembrance and education.  The Promoter will also take steps to \nnotify local residents through the local press and other routes. The Promoter will \nsimilarly take steps to ensure that the availability of updated information relating \nto the planning application and submitted by the Promoter (including updated \ninformation relating to security, as far as such information can safely be placed in \nthe public domain) is notified to the parties referred to in (b) and (c) above, and to \nlocal residents, once it has been published by the Secretary of State as part of the \nreactivated planning process.\n Separate entities for managing the proposed HMLC and the remaining \nparts of VTG \n Assurance 10 (paragraph 113) \nThe Promoter has given the Committee an assurance  that the Promoter’s \nintention is for the remit of any permanent independent body that is established to \noperate and run the proposed HMLC to be limited to the area of VTG occupied \nand used by the proposed HMLC. \n37 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\n Restoration and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster \n Recommendation 4 (paragraph 117) \nWe recommend  that before the Promoter submits its representations (including \nupdated evidence) to the Minister following re-activation of the planning process \nfor the proposed HMLC detailed consideration is given by the Promoter as to how \nthe construction and operation of the proposed HMLC and R&R will interact \nwith each other, and accommodate the use of VTG by nearby residents and their \nchildren.\n General (paragraph 119) \nAll of the above assurances  and the undertaking  given by the Promoter are \nintended to supplement any steps required to be taken under conditions attached \nto any planning permission for the proposed HMLC rather than to replace them; \nand therefore should there be any conflict between any assurance or undertaking \nand the requirements of any such planning condition, the requirements of the \nplanning condition will take precedence.\n Assurance 11 (paragraph 120) \nThe Committee requested the Promoter to agree that all assurances and the \nundertaking in relation to the proposed HMLC will also apply to any other \nHolocaust memorial and learning centre in VTG. The Promoter was not willing to \nagree. Nor was the Promoter willing to agree a narrower request that all assurances \nand the undertaking in relation to the proposed HMLC will also apply to any \nother Holocaust memorial and learning centre in VTG unless there are planning \nor other practical difficulties in implementing them in the new scheme. The most \nthat the Promoter is willing to agree is that the Promoter gives an assurance  to \nthe Committee that, in the event the currently proposed scheme is not granted \nplanning consent, in formulating any replacement proposal brought forward in \nplace of the currently proposed scheme, the Promoter will, to the extent relevant \nto the replacement proposal, give careful attention to the issues highlighted by the \nCommittee as reflected in the assurances and the undertaking given.\n38 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nAPPENDI x 6:  PLAN REFERENCED IN ASSURANCE 7\nSMITH SQUARE\nHORSEFERRY ROAD\nPlant building\nCafe to replace existing with similar footprint Main Holocaust Memorial building Basement footprint (including pile foundations)ABINGDON STREET\nGREAT COLLEGE STREET\nABINGDON STREET GARDENSLITTLE COLLEGE STREET\nGREAT PETER STREET\nDEAN STANLEY STREET\nMILLBANK\n\n39 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nAPPENDI x 7:  RIGHT TO BE HEARD RESTRICTIONS\n Restrictions on the right to be heard\n1. Generally speaking, a person who is petitioning against a private or hybrid \nbill has a right to be heard if they prove that their property or interests are \ndirectly and specially affected by the bill: Erskine May (25th edition, 2019), \nparagraph 44.5.\n2. In addition, the Private Business Standing Orders of the House specify \nvarious circumstances in which a petitioner has the right to have their \npetition considered (Standing Orders 115, 117A, 119 and 120) and other \ncases where the committee has a discretion to consider a petition (Standing \nOrders 117 and 118).\n3. In the present case the only Standing Orders that are relevant are 117(2) \nand 118. Standing Order 117(2) confers a discretion on the Committee to \nconsider the petition of a society, association or other body, which sufficiently \nrepresents amenity, educational, travel or recreational interests, alleging that \nthe interests they represent will be adversely affected to a material extent \nby the provisions contained in the bill.  Standing Order 118 confers on the \nCommittee a discretion to consider petitions against the bill or any provisions \nof it by inhabitants of the area. \n4. If the petitioner cannot prove that they have a right to be heard and they do \nnot satisfy one or more of the grounds in the Standing Orders, then they do \nnot have standing to speak in support of their petition.\n Restrictions on the arguments that can be advanced by those who have a \nright to be heard \n5. The only role of the select committee in the case of a hybrid bill is to ensure \nappropriate protection of “private” interests affected by the bill. The House \nconsiders the impact on the public and wider public issues in the usual stages \nof the legislative process – committee, report and third reading.\n6. The Committee’s function is not to conduct a roving investigation into \ngeneral merits. As mentioned above, objections based on public policy are \nreserved for subsequent stages of the legislative process.\n7. The Committee has no power, in the absence of express authority from the \nHouse, to hear any evidence other than that tendered by any party entitled \nto be heard: Standing Order 124.  It cannot, therefore, call expert or other \nevidence on its own initiative.\n8. It is a long-standing convention that the Committee cannot consider any \namendments that are destructive of the “principle” of the Bill. In the present \ncase, for the principle of the Bill reference must be made to clauses 1 and 2.\n9. The Committee cannot make an amendment that is outside the scope of the \nBill. Where a bill has one or two purposes, only amendments relating to those \npurposes, or touching on matters closely connected with them, are relevant. \n10. The Committee may not amend the Bill in a way that would require an \nadditional provision (Standing Order 73(2)). An additional provision is an \namendment which extends the scope of a bill in such a way as to bring into \nplay the application of Private Business Standing Orders (that is, notices, \ndeposits etc.) in respect of that amendment.\n40 HOLOCAUST M EMORIAL B ILL\nAPPENDI x 8:  LORD CARLILE’S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS \nRELATED TO SECURITY \nLord Carlile submitted the following amendments (with a caveat that they are \nsubject to later discussion with the Public Bill Office). \n After Clause 2 \nAfter Clause 2, insert the following new Clause – \n(1) Within three months of the passing of this Act the Secretary of State \nwill provide a report to both Houses of Parliament setting out the \neffects arising from the construction, presence and use of the Holocaust \nMemorial and Learning Centre on the chosen site.

This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n Overview of the Bill \n1  This Bill confers the powers required to construct part of the second phase –  “Phase 2b (Crewe \n– Manchester)” - of a proposed new national high speed rail network, “High Speed 2” (or \n“HS2”). Phase 2b (Crewe – Manchester) will involve the construction of a new railway line \nfrom Crewe to Manchester, serving new stations at Manchester Airport and Manchester \nPiccadilly. A railway  will also be constructed  between  Hoo Green in Cheshire and a junction \nwith the West Coast Main Line at Bamfurlong , which  will enable trains to transfer between \nthe HS2 main line and the West Coast Main Line. A new train stabling facility for HS2 trains will also be constructed between Gretna Green and Kirkpatrick Fleming in Dumfries and \nGalloway.  A 15 mile  stretch  of the Phase 2b route will also form the backbone of Northern \nPowerhouse Rail , a proposed new rail network connecting major cities in the North of \nEngland.   \n2  On 21  May 2024 a new Instruction Motion was passed for this bill. The Instruction Motion \nprovides that only those works required as part of Northern Powerhouse Rail should be \ncontinued, with all other works to be removed from the B ill before it is reported back to the \nHouse by the Select Committee.  \nPolicy background  \n3  The 2010 Coalition Programme for Government included a commitment to establish a \nnational high speed rail network, and to do so in phases. Following a period of consultation and an appraisal of sustainability, in January 2012 the Secretary of State for Transport \npresented to Parliament the Command Paper “High Speed Rail: Investing in Britain’s Future -  \nDecisions and Next Steps” (Cm 8247) . In that paper, the Secretary of State decided to promote \na high speed rail network known as “HS2” linking London, the West Midlands, Leeds and \nManchester with intermediate stations in the East Midlands and Sheffield.  \n4  In November 2016, the Government published the Command Paper  “High Speed Two: From \nCrewe to Manchester, the West Midlands to Leeds and beyond” (Cm 9355)  confirming most  of \nthe Phase 2b route. Alongside the preferred route of Phase 2b, the Government also \nannounced a consultation on seven route refinement areas. On 17 July 2017, the Government \nannounced a decision on these refinements and confirmed the remainder of the preferred \nroute for Phase 2b.  \n5  Consultations were run on both the working draft Environmental Statement and working \ndraft Equality Im pact Assessment Report in October 2018. These consultations allowed \nmembers of the public and organisations to comment on preliminary environmental \ninformation and the potential effects of constructing and operating  Phase 2b on groups of \npeople with protected characteristics.  \n6  The Government commissioned Douglas Oakervee to lead a review of the HS2  project in \nAugust 2019. The Oakervee Review was published in February 2020 and the Government \nannounced its decision to proceed with the project.  As part of this announcement, Phase 2b \nwas to be sp lit into smaller, more manageable sections, delivered through separate hybrid \nBills.  \n7  The Government  also accepted the Oakervee recommendation to proceed with an Integrated \nRail Plan  for the North and Midlands . This set out the form,  scope and phasing of Northern \nPowerhouse Rail, HS2 Phase 2b, Midlands Rail Hub  and other major rail  programmes .  \n7 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 8  The Integrated Rail Plan  was published o n 18 November 2021, and confirmed the \nGovernment’s intention to build HS2 from Crewe to Manchester  with new stations at \nManchester Airport and Manchester Piccadilly.  \n9  On 4 October 2023 the Government publishe d Network North:  Transforming British \nTransport (CP946) , cancelling HS2 North of the West Midlands, but recommitting to delivery \nof Northern Powerhouse Rail  as previously planned.  On 25 March 2024 the Government \nconfirmed that it would continue to promote this bill to deliver the 15 miles of the former \nPhase 2b route  between Millington, in Cheshire and Manchester  still required for Northern \nPowerhouse Rail.     \n10  The High Speed Rail (Preparation) Act 2013 authorises the Secretary of State to incur \nexpenditure in preparation for the construction of a high speed rail network. That Act is \nintended to ensure that, following enactment of the High Speed Rail ( Crewe - Manchester ) \nBill, the development of the proposed network might proceed without delay. That Act’s other \nprovisions include a power for the Secretary of State to incur expenditure in providing \ncompensation in respect of property likely to be affected by the construction of the proposed \nnetwork.  \n11  The Government proposes that, subject to the successful passage of the High Speed Rail \n(Crewe - Manchester ) Bill, construction of the railway between Millington  and Manchester \nwould commence i mmediately following Royal Assent .  \n12  This Bill is a  hybrid  Bill. This means it is of general application, but it contains provisions \nwhich have a different legal effect on the private interests of particular persons. In procedural \nterms, this means it will be considered as a Public Bill, but will be treated as similar to a \nPrivate Bill during certain stages of its passage through Parliament. The hybrid Bill procedure \ngives those persons who are directly and specially affected an opportunity to petition against \nthe Bill and be heard in Select Committee.   \nLegal background  \n13  This Bill will form part of the legislative authority for the construction of the high speed rail \nnetwork from Crewe to Manchester . The High Speed Rail (London –  West Midlands) Act 2017 \nprovides the legislative authority for the construction of the first phase of the network from \nLondon to West Midlands.  The High Speed Rail (West Midlands - Crewe) Act  2021 provides \nthe legislative authority for the construction of the second phase from the West Midlands to Crewe. \nTerritorial extent and application  \n14  The provision made by the Bill for the acquisition of land and the authorisation of works is local in nature. However, as with the High Speed Rail (London -West Midlands) Act 2017 (the \nPhase one Act), the High Speed Rail (West Midlands- Crewe) Act 2021 (the Phase 2a Act), the \nCrossrail Act 2008, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996 and other hybrid bills, this Bill does \nnot expressly limit its territorial extent. This means that that the Bill extends to the United \nKingdom but most of the provisions will apply to England and Scotland only.  \n15  Although the high speed rail line authorised by the Bill will be situated in England only, the \nBill does authorise development in Scotland for the purposes of ensuring an effective link \n8 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Therefore, the majority of the provisions will apply to England and also to \nScotland.  \n16  At introduction this Bill, unlike the provisions of the Phase 2a Act, but similar to the Phase one \nAct, will contain provisions which trigger the Sewel convention. The Sewel convention \nprovides that Westminster will not normally legislate with regards to devolved matters in \nScotland without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. While cross -border rail infrastructure \nis a reserved matter, there are provisions in the Bill which require that  consent to legislate will \nbe sought  from the Scottish Government.  \n17  None of the provisions contained in this Bill will have an impact upon matters that have been \ndevolved to the Welsh Government or the Northern Ireland Assembly.  \n18  The Rt Hon Louise Haigh  MP is of the view that the Bill as introduced into the House of \nCommons does not contain provision which, if enacted, would affect trade between Northern \nIreland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Accordingly, no statement under section 13C of \nthe European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 has been made.  \n19  See the table in Annex A for a summary of the position regarding territorial extent and \napplication  in the United Ki ngdom. \n9 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n  \nCommentary on provisions of Bill/Act   \nPart 1: Works  \nClause  1: Power to construct and maintain works for Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)   \n1  The primary purpose of the Bill is to authorise the construction of Phase 2b (Crewe –  \nManchester) of High Speed 2. The provisions in Clause  1 allow the nominated undertaker to \ncarry out the construction and maintenance of the principal works for this (known as the \nscheduled works), further detail s of which can be found in Schedule 1 . \nSchedule 1 : Scheduled Works  \nConstruction requirements  \n2  Schedule 1  sets out the Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester) scheduled works, which are the main \nworks authorised by the Bill. As well as railway works, these include tram works in Manchester required in consequence of the constructions of the railway works. Each of these \nworks has a centre line (or in the case of a road widening, a limit of widening) shown for it on \nthe deposited plans, with a limit of lateral deviation, and a level shown for it on the deposited \nsections.  \n3  By virtue of P aragraph 1(1) , the scheduled works must be constructed in the lines or situations, \nand at the levels, shown on these plans. Some buildings also have an upper limit shown for \nthem on the deposited sections, in which case the relevant works must be constructed within \nthe limit.  \n4  Paragraph 1(2)  allows deviation laterally from these lines or situations, but only within the \nlimits of deviation shown on the plans. It also allows unlimited deviation downwards from \nthe levels shown, and deviation upwards of not more than three metres. This power to deviate \nupwards is subject to any upper limit applying to stations, depots and shafts, if applicable.  \n5  Paragraph 1(3)  allows the nominated undertaker to substitute an engineering work not shown \non the deposited plans or specified in the Schedule for an engineering work shown on those \nplans or specified in the Schedule.  \n6  Paragraph 1(4)  indicates this may include a bridge, tunnel, viaduct, cutting or embankment.  \nClause  2: Further provision about works   \n7  Subsection (1)  allows the nominated undertaker to carry out ancillary works within the Act \nlimits. Act limits are defined in Clause 63(1) as land within the limits of deviation or within the \nlimits of land to be acquired or used.  \n8  The types of works which may be undertaken in connection with the railway are set out in \nSubsections (1)  and (2).  \n9  Subsection (3)  allows the nominated undertaker to carry out, within the Act limits, landscaping \nor other mitigation works to reduce the impact of construction, maintenance or operation of the Phase 2b works, and to undertake works which are intended to benefit or protect land \naffected by the Phase 2b works.  \n10 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 10  Subsection (4)  introduces Schedule 2 , which contains additional works powers. Details of these \ncan be found below.  \n11  Subsection (5)  authorises the nominated undertaker to carry out the electric line works that are \nspecifically authorised by the Bill and as specified in  Schedule 3 . \n12  Subsection (6) authorises a set of ancillary works powers as set out in Sc hedule 4  in relation to  \nthe Manchester tram works. Details of these ancillary powers can be found below.  \nSchedule 2: Works  \nAuthority to survey and investigate land  and protect and remove flora and fauna  \n13  Schedule 2  contains a number of further and supplementary works powers for Phase 2b  \n(Crewe – Manchester) purposes .  \n14  Paragraph s 1(1) and 1(4) authorise the nominated undertaker to survey or investigate land \nwhich is within the Act limits or affected by the Phase 2b (Crewe – Manchester) works to \nprotect or remove flora or fauna.  \n15  Paragraphs  1(2) and 1(3) provide that the nominated undertaker may enter land for these \npurposes and to monitor the effectiveness of mitigation measures.  \n16  Paragraphs  1(5) and 1(6) apply provisions of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 on the \nexercise of these powers. These include the requirements to give notice to landowners, to pay \ncompensation in relation to damage and to obtain a warrant where necessary authorising the \nuse of force to enter land. \nSupport of buildings and apparatus etc.  \n17  Paragraph 2(1)  enables the nominated undertaker, on giving 8 weeks’ notice to the occupier, to \nsupport or strengthen buildings that may be affected by construction. This is because there \nmay be cases where construction can lead to ground movement which requires supporting or \nstrengthening work to be carried out for nearby buildings. These powers apply to buildings \nwithin the relevant distance of the works (see P aragraph 6(3)  of Schedule 2 ).  \n18  Paragraph 2(2)  provides for recourse to arbitration if the occupier disputes the need for the \nsupporting work to be carried out within 21 days . \n19  Paragraph 2(3) enables an arbitrator to prescribe how such supporting works are to be \nundertaken if the arbitrator decides the conditions  of sub-paragraph (1)(a)  are met .  \n20  Paragraph 2(4)  contains provisions for the nominated undertaker to enter adjacent land to \ncarry out the supporting works if the  works  cannot reasonably conveniently be carried out \nwithout doing so. The nominated undertaker must give the owners of the adjacent land 14 days’ notice  before entering the land.  \n21  Paragraph 2(5)  provides that the power under s ub-paragraph s (1) or (4) may be exercised \nwithout notice in an emergency.  \n22  Paragraph 2(6)  permits the nominated undertaker to enter and survey buildings and land to \ndecide whether and how to carry out supporting work . Paragraph 2(7)  sets 14 days’ notice for \nthis entry.  \n23  Under Paragraph 2(8)  the nominated undertaker may  leave equipment or material in, next to , \nor under the building, or on or under land in its vicinity , in order to strengthen or support a \n11 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Under P aragraph 4(7) , the \nnominated undertaker may also from time to time maintain, repair or alter the position of \nmovement measuring  apparatus and take readings from it.  \n29  Paragraph 5  applies Paragraphs 2  to 4 to the apparatus of a utility undertaker or relevant \npipe-lines belonging to another body. This is subject to the conditions set out in P aragraph 5(3)  \nand modifications in P aragraph 5(5) . \n30  Paragraph 6  refers to relevant definitions.  \nTrees on neighbouring land \n31  Paragraph 7 (1) to 7(7) provides for cases where trees overhang or otherwise encroach on land \nused for the purposes of Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester) . The nominated undertaker may \nserve a notice (“a tree works notice”) on the occupier of the land requiring the occupier to remove or prune a tree or cut its roots for maintenance or safety reasons. The occupier may then serve a counter notice within 28 days in which case the tree works notice only has effect \nif confirmed by the county court. If a tree works notice is in effect for a continuous period of \n28 days without being complied with, the nominated undertaker may enter the land and carry \nout the tree works.  \n32  Paragraph 7(8) provides that works required by a tree works notice may be carried out on a \ntree which is subject to a tree preservation order or which is in a conservation area.  \n33  Paragraph 7(9) allows a landowner to recover compensation for complying with a tree works \nnotice.  \nExercise of powers of rights of entry under P aragraphs 2 to 7  \n34  Paragraph 8  applies where the nominated undertaker can enter land under any provisions set \nout in Paragraphs 2 to 7. \n35  Paragraphs  8(2) and 8(3) contains provisions to apply and modify certain sections of Part 7 of \nthe Housing and Planning Act 2016 as respects the powers of entry under P aragraphs 2  to 7. \nThese include the requirements to give notice to landowners, to pay compensation in relation \nto damage, and to obtain a warrant where necessary authorising the use of force to enter land.  \nNoise mitigation for buildings  \n36  Paragraph 9  authorises the nominated undertaker to carry out noise mitigation works in \nrespect of a building if it is for the purposes of or in connection with the construction or \n12 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Such works may be carried out only with \nthe consent of the owners and occupiers of the building.  \nDischarge of water  \n37  Paragraph 10 authorises the nominated undertaker to use watercourses and public sewers and \ndrains for the purposes of construction or maintenance of works authorised by the Bill. \nParagraph 10 (1) provides that this may entail the laying, removal and alteration of pipes or \nmaking connections with the watercourses, sewers or drains within the Act limits.  \n38  Paragraph 10(2)  provides that the nominated undertaker may not discharge water into any \npublic sewers or drains without the agreement of the owner, whose consent cannot be \nunreasonably withheld.  \n39  Paragraph 10(3)  requires the nominated undertaker not to make openings into public drains or \nsewers unless the owner  has given approval of the plans and the owner has been given an \nopportunity to supervise the works.  \n40  Under Paragraph 10(4) the nominated undertaker must not damage or interfere with the beds \nor banks of any watercourse forming part of a main river.  \n41  Paragraph 10(5)  requires the nominated undertaker to take reasonable steps to secure that \nwater being discharged is as free as is practicable from any solid substance, such as soil , \ngravel,  oil, or any other matter in suspension.  \n42  Paragraph 10(6)  makes it clear that in the event of any dispute as to the giving of consent under \nParagraph 10,  the matter should be referred to arbitration if both parties agree to do so, and to \nthe Secretary of State if they do not. \n43  Paragraph 10(7)  sets out a number of definitions used in Paragraph 10.  \nTemporary interference with waterways  \n44  Paragraph 11 contains provisions to allow the nominated undertaker to interfere temporarily \nwith the waterways identified in Paragraph 11(1).   \n45  Paragraph 11(2)  provides that the nominated undertaker may carry out temporary works or \ndredging works in relation to these waterways, can temporarily moor or anchor vessels in a waterway mentioned in Paragraph 11(1), and  can temporarily close such waterways .  \n46  Paragraph 11(3)  sets out that no more of a waterway is to be closed than is necessary in the \ncircumstances , and if complete closure is necessary , then all reasonable steps are to be taken to \ncause the minimum obstruction to users.  \n47  Paragraph s 11(4)  and (5) provide that the nominated undertaker is not liable for any losses \nwhich occur as a result of any interference with a public right of navigation, and provide for \ncompensation for losses as a result of interference with a private right of navigation.  \n48  Under Paragraph 11(6),  if there is a dispute, compensation must be determined in accordance \nwith Part 1 of the Land Compensation Act 1961.  \nElectronic communications apparatus  \n49  Paragraph 12  allows the nominated undertaker, when installing telecommunications apparatus \nfor Phase 2b, to provide additional capacity for others’ use  including by extending or altering \nelectronic communications apparatus to provide such capacity .  \n13 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

This term  excludes  radio \nmasts.  \nSchedule 3: Overhead line diversions  \n51  The table in this Schedule identifies the overhead line works authorised by Clause  2(5). \nClause  3: Highways  \n52  Subsection (1)  requires the nominated undertaker to gain  the consent of any relevant strategic \nhighways company before carrying out works in relation to a strategic highway.  \n53  Subsection (2)  introduces Schedule 5  which contains provisions relating to highways.  \nSchedule 4: Manchester tram works  \n54  Schedule 4  contains ancillary works powers in relation to the Manchester tram works.  \nGeneral  \n55  Paragraph 1  sets out that powers in Schedule  4 are in addition to powers contained in the rest of \nthis Bill. \nFurther powers in relation to the construction and maintenance of the Manchester tram \nworks  \n56  Paragraphs 2(1)  and 2(2) allow the nominated undertaker to carry out the specified works on \nthe Manchester tram network for the purposes of construction, maintenance or mitigation of \nworks authorised by the Bill.  \n57  Paragraph 2(3)  provides that the works in P aragraphs 2(1)  and (2) may not take place within the \nboundaries of streets outside the Act limits without the consent of the street authority, whose \nconsent cannot be unreasonably withheld.  \n58  Under Paragraph  2(4), Paragraph 2(5)  applies where the nominated undertaker  lays down \nconduits for Manchester tram works apparatus.  \n59  Paragraph  2(5) allows other persons to use conduits or access  facilities to conduits constructed \nfor the purposes of the Manchester tram works as agreed between  the nominated undertaker  \nand the other persons . \nPowers in relation to laying down lines of rails  \n60  Paragraph 3  allows the nominated undertaker to lay down different configurations of rails as \npart of the Manchester tram works, provided that consent has been granted by the street \nauthority, which cannot be unreasonably withheld.  \nConstruction of street tramways and tramroads  \n61  Notwithstanding  how the Manchester tram works are described in the Act, P aragraph 4(1)  \nprovides that the tram works can be constructed along a street as a street tramway or off -road \nas a tramroad and are to be regarded as authorised to be constructed in the chosen way. This \napplies as long as the construction is within the limits of deviation for that work.   \n62  If a tramway becomes a tramroad through the creation or extinction of rights of way , \nParagraph 4(2)  states that the new tramroad should be treated as if it were constructed as a \ntramroad. The same applies for a tramroad which becomes a tramway. \n14 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

The street authority must not unreasonably withhold \nconsent.  \n72  Paragraph 6(3)  gives apparatus the same meaning as in Part 3 (street works in England and \nWales) of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.  A reference to any work or apparatus in \na street also includes any work or apparatus under, over, along, or upo n that street.  \nRestoration of streets if street tramway is discontinued  \n73  If tram works are abandoned, or cease operating, under P aragraph 7 , the nominated \nundertaker must restore the portion of the street along which the rails were laid, or were due \nto be laid, unless otherwise agreed with the street authority.

The works must be reasonabl y capa ble of being carried out  \nat that other  place.  \n118  If works under Paragraph 1(1) are to be carried out on a highway with vehicular traffic, \nParagraph 1(5) requires that the work s are carried out in accordance with plans approved by \nthe highway authority.  \n119  Under Paragraph 1 (6), the only ground on which approval of the plans can be refused is that \nthe plans ought to be modified to prevent or reduce either injury to local amenity or effects on \nroad safety, and are reasonably capable of being so modified.  \n120  Paragraphs 1 (7) and 1(8) concern works  under Paragraph 1(1)  for access undertaken within the \nAct limits at places not shown on the deposited plans. These require the highway authority’s \napproval, which must not  be unreasonably withheld.  \n121  Paragraph (9)  requires  the highway authority to consider  effects on road safety and on the free \nflow of traffic  when considering whether to give consent  or approval  for the purposes of  \nParagraph 1(7)  or Paragraph 1(8) . \n122  Paragraphs 1 (10) and 1(11) establish that, if  the highway authority does not respond within 28 \ndays to requests under Paragraphs 1(5), 1( 7), or 1(8) , it is assumed to have approved the plans \nor given consent.  \n123  Paragraph 1 (12) provides that, if the location of access works is moved as a result of P aragraph \n1(3), then Paragraphs 1 (5), 1(7), and 1(8) apply as if the new location were shown on the \ndeposited plans.  \n124  Under P aragraph 1(13), if there is any dispute with a highway authority under Paragraph 1,  the \nmatter should be referred to arbitration if both parties agree to do so, and to the Secretary of \nState if they do not.  \nPart 2 – Interference with highways  \nStopping up  \n125  Paragraph 2 (1) authorises the nominated undertaker to stop up certain highways permanently. \nThe highways which may be stoppe d-up for this purpose are listed in table 1  or 2 in Part 4  of \nthis Schedule .  \n126  Under  Paragraph 2(2), highways specified in table 1  in Part 4 of the Schedule  may not be \nstopped up unless all of the land abutting the highway fall into one or more categories \n19 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

As long as the three conditions listed are satisfied, the application \nmust be granted.  \n134  Paragraph 3(4) states that the appropriate Ministers must notify the nominated undertaker of \nthe basis on which an  application under Paragraph 3(2) was granted.  \n135  Paragraph 3(5)  stipulates that if a n application  under Paragraph 3(2)  is granted on the basis that \na substitute footpath or bridleway is to be provided by the nominated undertaker, the original \ncannot be stopped up until the substitute is available.  \n136  Paragraph 3(6)  provides that, before the stopping up is confirmed, the nominated undertaker \nmust publish certain details in a notice in a local newspaper with a circulation in the relevant \narea. The notice is required to set out how  the footpath or bridleway is to be altered, if there is \nan alternative route, and if no alternative is proposed, the reasons why this is the case. It must \nalso specify how affected parties can make representations about the proposals.  \n137  Paragraph 3(7)  states that the nominated undertaker must provide copies of the newspaper \nnotice to every local authority whose area is affected, and also place the notice  at each end of \nthe bridleway or footpath no later than the notice publication date .  \n138  Under sub-paragraph (8) , these representations must be considered before the appropriate \nMinisters confirm an application  under Paragraph  3(2). \n139  Paragraph 3(9)  provides that unless the appropriate Ministers direct otherwise, the Ministers’ \nfunctions under Paragraph 3(2)  must be carried out by a person appointed by them for that \npurpose.  \n20 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

It may also create or improve temporary accesses from \nthe highway to places outside the Act limits (within the Act limits, paragraph 1  of Schedule 5  \nauthorises the creation or improvement of highway accesses).  \n155  Under  Paragraph 8(2), the nominated undertaker may enter upon and use the airspace above \nany highway for the oversailing of cranes.  \n156  Under  Paragraph 8(3), the nominated undertaker must provide reasonable access for \npedestrians to or from premises abutting the highway affected by Paragraph  8(1)(a) to \nParagraph 8(1)(c) if otherwise there would be no access to those premises . \n157  Where the highway is specified in table 4  in Part 4  of the Schedule , under Paragraph s 8(4) and \n8(5), the relevant authority must be consulted with respect to highway safety and convenience \nbefore powers under Paragraphs 8(1) or 8(2)  are exercised.  \n158  In other cases, P aragraph 8(6) requires the consent of the relevant authority to be obtained in \nwriting by the nominated undertaker prior to the power being exercised. Consent under  \nParagraph 8(6) is subject to Paragraph s 8(10) and 8(12). \n159  Paragraphs 8(7) and 8(9) provide that the relevant authority may not unreasonably withhold \nconsent, but may apply reasonable conditions in the interests of public safety or convenience, and that any disputes about this must be determined by arbitration if both parties agree to the \narbitration process, and to the Secretary of State if they do not . \n160  Paragraph 8(8) provides that consent will be assumed to have been given after 28 days, unless \nthe authority notifies the applicant to the contrary within that period  of 28 days . \n161  Paragraph 8(10) states that consent is not required under P aragraph 8(5) if the nominated \nundertaker considers work under P aragraph 8(1) needs to be done urgently to prevent serious \ndamage, avoid danger to the public, or for the purposes of using powers under any of Paragraphs 2  to 6 of Schedule 2.  \n162  Under Paragraph 8(11), t he relevant authority must be consulted  to ensure highway safety and \nreduce public inconvenience as far as reasonably practicable . \n163  Paragraph 8(1 2) provides that consent is not required when the nominated undertaker decides \nit is necessary to place a traffic sign in a highway not specified in table 4  in Part 4 of this \nSchedule in consequence of works in a highway which is specified in that table.   \n164  Paragraph 8 (13) provides that a highway stopped up under Paragraphs  1(1)(a) to (1)(d) and 2 \ndoes not have to be reinstated after its temporary closure if that same highway is then permanently stopped up under P aragraph 2(1)  or Paragraph 3(1).  \n165  Paragraph 8(1 4) sets out the meanings of “relevant authority” and “street furniture”. \nStreet works  \n166  Paragraph 9(1)  allows the nominated undertaker to place, maintain, reposition and remove \napparatus in the highway, and also carry out works for these purposes.  \n167  Paragraph 9(2) states that if work could be carried out under either P aragraph 9  of this Schedule , \n22 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Paragraph 19 applies this to the \nmaintenance responsibilities of the nominated undertaker under P aragraph s 17(2)  or 17(3)(a).  \n200  Paragraph 20 modifies the maintenance duties for bridges applying under section 46 of the \nRailways Clause s Consolidation Act 1845, to bring them into line with current practice (so that \nthe highway authority is responsible for maintaining the surface of the highway and the \nnominated undertaker is responsible for the bridge).  \nBridges carrying highways \n201  Paragraph 21 applies the same rules under sections 116 to 117 of the Transport Act 1968 \nconcerning bridges over railways to Phase 2b (Crewe –  Manchester) of High Speed 2 as apply \nto the national rail network.  \nPart 4 – Tables relating to Part 2 of Schedule  \n202  Part 4  contains tables that are relevant to the powers exercisable under Part 2  of Schedule  5. \nPart 2: Compulsory Acquisition of Land  \nClause  4: Power to acquire land compul sorily  \n203  Clause  4 Subsection (1)  gives the Secretary of State powers of compulsory acquisition over the \nland shown within the limits of deviation and the limits of land to be acquired or used on the plans accompanying this Act. The land may only be acquired if it is needed “for Phase 2b  \n(Crewe – Manchester)  purposes”. This expression is defined in Clause  63. \n204  Subsection (2)  introduces Schedule 6 which makes provision about the purposes for which the \nland within the limits of land to be acquired or used, as shown on the Bill plans, may be \nacquired.  \n205  Subsection (3)  provides that Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 applies to the \nacquisition of land under the Bill as if the Bill were a compulsory purchase order under the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, subject to the modifications contained in Schedule 7 referred to \nbelow . Part 1 of the 1965 Act provides for procedures for the compulsory acquisition of land.    \n206  Subsection (4)  provides that the provisions of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) \nAct 1981 also apply as if this Bill were a compulsory purchase order, subject again to the modifications contained in Schedule 7.

A time limit is instead provided by Clause 9. \nParagraph 2(4) makes a change which is consequential on that made by P aragraph 2(2).   \n212  Paragraph 2(3)  reduces the period between serving a notice to treat and entering and taking \npossession from 3 months to 1 month in  cases where only subsoil lying more than 4.5 metres \nbelow the surface, airspace  or an easement , restrictive covenant  or other right over land is \nacquired.  \n213  Paragraph 2( 4) reduces the length of the supplementary notice of entry required to be served \nunder section 11A of the 1965 Act on an additional occupier or person with an interest in land \nwho is identified after the service of a notice of entry on to the land but before possession has \nbeen taken. The period of the notice is reduced to 7 days where the newly identified person is an occupier or is an occupier whose existence has not been identified previously because \nmisleading information has been given or where only subsoil  lying more than 4.5 metres \nbelow the surface, airspace or a right is to be acquired or a restrictive covenant is to be \nimposed. In other cases, the period of notice is reduced to 28 days. \n214  Paragraph 2(6) makes it clear that reference to taking possession in Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act, which applies where only part of a house, building or factory is proposed to be acquired, \nare references to taking permanent possession as opposed to taking temporary possession \nunder Schedule 15. \nCompulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981  \n215  Paragraph 3  makes modifications to provisions of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting \nDeclarations) Act 1981 for cases where a vesting declaration is made under the Bill and not under a compulsory purchase order. In particular, P aragraph 3(3)(a) provides that the 1981 Act \nhas effect as if before section 4 there were inserted section 3A (Preliminary notices) , which \nmakes provision for preliminary notices to be served on persons with relevant interests in land in place of the equivalent procedure provided for under the 1981 Act which only applies \nwhere a compulsory purchase order has been made.

This includes power to acquire or create easements and other rights and to impose restrictive covenants.  \n218  Subs ection  5(2) provides that, in the case of land specified in Schedule 8, only rights in land may \nbe compulsorily acquired, or restrictive covenants imposed, for the purposes mentioned in the \ntable.  \n219  Subs ection  5(3) provides that the power of compulsory acquisition  conferred under Clause 4(1) \nincludes the power to acquire rights or to impose restrictive covenants for the benefit of a  \nperson other than the Secretary of State . \n220  Subs ection  5(4) enables the Secretary of State,  by order , to provide that a person specified in the \norder may exercise the powers under the Bill to acquire rights , or impose restrictive \ncovenants. Some of the land within the Bill limits, particularly that outside the limits of \ndeviation , but within the land to be acquired or used, is intended to be used for the diversion \nof statutory undertakers’ apparatus. An order made under S ubsection  5(4) will enable a \nstatutory undertaker to create the rights in land necessary to e ffect the diversion of the \napparatus rather than those rights being acquired by the Secretary of State for the benefit of \nthe undertaker concerned.  \n221  Subsection 5(5) provides that the power to make an order under S ubsection  5(4) includes a \npower to make an order varying or revoking an order previously made under that subsection.  \n222  Subsections 5(6) and 5(7) make provision for the power to acquire rights or impose covenants \nover land  provided for in Clause  5(1) to be exercised for the benefit of a utility undertaker or \nthe owner of a relevant pipeline, where they are for Phase 2b (Crewe –  Manchester) purposes . \nWhere, immediately before removal of the existing apparatus or pipeline in connection with \nPhase 2b (Crewe - Manchester) purposes , the  apparatus  had the benefit of rights or covenants \nover land in relation to the existing apparatus or pipeline that were subject to commercial or \nother terms , Subsection 5(7)  makes provision for those terms to be reflected in the rights to be \nacquired pursuant to Clause  4(1) of the Bill .  \n223  Subsection 5(7) enables rights to be acquired or the covenants to be imposed under S ubsection  \n5(6) to have effect incorporating such commercial or other terms as  may be  required in the \nexercise of the power conferred under S ubsection  5(1).  \n224  Subsection 5(9) defines  what  a “relevant pipe -line” is for the purposes of Clause 5. \n225  Subsection 5(10) introduces  Schedules 9 and 10 which contain provision about the application of \ncompulsory purchase legislation to compulsory acquisition under this Clause . \nSchedule 8: Land where powers of acquisition are limited to acquisition of rights or \nimposition of restrictiv e covenants  \n27 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 226  Schedule 8  specifies the land in respect of which the compulsory power in Clause 4(1) is limited \nto the acquisition of rights or the imposition of covenants for the purposes specified in relation \nto the land in column (3)  of the table.  \nSchedule 9: Acquisition of rights in land etc: application of compulsory purchase \nlegislation  \nCompulsory Purchase Act 1965 and compensation enactments  \n227  Schedule 9  makes modifications to provisions of compulsory purchase legislation, which refer \nto the acquisition of land, to make them apt for the acquisition of rights and the imposition of \nrestrictive covenants. The effect of the modifications is that the regime under that legislation \nwill apply where the powers to acquire land under Clause  4(1) are used to acquire existing \nrights, to create rights or to impose restrictive covenants. \n228  Paragraphs 1(a)  and 2 make specific modifications to provisions of the Compulsory Purchase \nAct 1965, the Land Compensation Act 1961  and the Land Compensation Act 1973 which are \nneeded to make them apply where rights are acquired, or restrictive covenants imposed, in \nexercise of the compulsory acquisition power under Clause 4(1).  \n229  Paragraphs 3(1)(a)  and 4 make specific modifications to provisions of the Compulsory \nPurchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981 which are similarly needed to make them fit where rights are acquired, or restrictive covenants imposed, under that power. In addition , \nParagraphs 1(b)  and 3(1)(b) provide that enactments relating to compulsory acquisition are to \nhave effect with such other modifications as may be necessary to make them suitable where \nrights are acquired, or restrictive covenants imposed, under that power. \nSchedule 10: Acquisition of rights in land: substituted Schedule 2A for Compulsory \nPurchase Act 1965  \n230  Schedule 10 sets outs the version of Schedule 2A to the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 that is \nreferred to in P aragraph 2(8) of Schedule 9 . \nClause  6: Acquisition of airspace  \n231  Certain works for the railway may require the taking of only the airspace above land shown \non the deposited plans rather than the totality of the land. Clause 6 Subsection  (1) enables the \nSecretary of State to acquire compulsorily only the airspace over land, without acquiring the land itself.  \n232  Subsection (2)  disapplies the provisions of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 , the Compulsory \nPurchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981  and the Town and Country Planning Act 1990  which \nenable a landowner, where it is proposed to purchase only part of property, to require the \nwhole of the property to be acquired on the ground that taking that part of the land would \nresult in material detriment to the remainder of the land. The result is that where only \nairspace over land is acquired, the Secretary of State cannot be required to acquire a greater \ninterest in the  property.  \nClause  7: Acquisition of subsoil or under -surface  \n233  Some of the land shown on the deposited plans is required for underground railway tunnels \nand ancillary works where only the subsoil of the land needs to be acquired. Clause 7 \nSubsection  (1) enables the Secretary of State to acquire compulsorily the subsoil only, rather \nthan having to acquire the whole of the land.   \n28 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 234  Subsection (2)  disapplies the provisions of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 , the Compulsory \nPurchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981 , the Land Compensation Act 1973 and the Town and \nCountry Planning Act 1990 which enable a landowner, in certain cases where it is proposed to \npurchase only part of property, to require the whole of the property to be acquired on the \nground that taking that part of the land would result in material detriment to the remainder of \nthe land. The result is that, where only the subsoil of land is acquired, the Secretary of State \ncannot be required to acquire a greater interest in the property.  \n235  Subsection (3)  excludes  from a disapplication under Subsection  (2) cases where a cellar, vault, \narch or other construction forming part of a building is to be acquired compulsorily. In such a case, the landowner’s right to claim that the whole of the property should be acquired on the \nground of material detriment is not affected.   \n236  Subsection (4)  introduces Schedule 11 which in certain cases restricts the Secretary of State’s \npower to acquire land to the purchase of subsoil or under -surface of land, or to both the \nsubsoil or under -surface and rights of passage.  \nSchedule 11: Land where powers of acquisition are limited to sub -surface acquisition  \nRestriction of power of compulsory acquisition to land under the surface or rights of \npassage  \n237  Schedule 11 restricts the power of compulsory acquisition under Clause  4(1) to subsoil which is \nspecified in the table s in Paragraph s 1 to 4 as being subsoil at a specified depth below surface \nlevel of the land .  \n238  Paragraph 1 provide s that powers of compulsory acquisition may only be exercised in relation \nto so much of the subsoil or und er-surface of land as lies more than 9  meters below surface \nlevel for land listed in set out in Paragraph 1 . Paragraph 2  provides that powers of compulsory \nacquisition may only be exercised in relation to so much of the subsoil or under -surface of \nland as lies more than 7.5  metres below surface level for land listed in the  table set out in \nParagraph 2.  Paragraph 3  provides that powers of compulsory acquisition may only be \nexercised in relation to so much of the subsoil or und er-surface of land as lies more than 6 \nmeters below surface level for land listed in set out in Paragraph 3.  Paragraph 4  provides that \npowers of compulsory acquisition may only be exercised in relation to so much of the subsoil or und er-surface of land as lies more than 4.5 meters below surface level for land listed in set \nout in Paragraph 4.    \n239  Paragraph 5(1) provides that the power of compulsory acquisition may only be exercised either \nin relation to so much of the subsoil or under -surface of land as lies more than 9 metres below \nthe level of the surface and/or the acquisition of rights of passage in respect of the land listed \nin the table set out in Paragraph 5 . \n240  Paragraph 5(2) defines the meaning  of the phrase  “rights of passage”  for Phase 2b (Crewe – \nManche ster) purposes.   \n241  Paragraph 6(1) applies the powers of section 5(1)(b) to impose restrictive covenants in relation \nto the land identified in P aragraphs  1 to 5 of Schedule 11.  \n242  Paragraph 6(2) provides that Paragraphs 1 to  5 do not restrict the exercise of powers under \nsection 4(1)  to cellars or other underground constructions forming part of a building which is \nwithin the Act  limits and is subject to compulsory acquisition under Clause 4(1). \n29 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

However, under S ubsection (2) , this does not apply to cellars, vaults, arches,  or \nother structures which form part of a building fronting on to the highway.  \n244  Subsections (3)  and (4) provide that the powers to take subsoil or compulsorily acquire an \ninterest in land cannot be exercised in the case of the highway land specified in the table in \nSchedule 1 2, except as regards a cellar or other underground structure which forms part of a \nbuilding which fronts onto the highway, is within the Act limits, and in respect of which the power of compulsory acquisition under Clause 4(1) is exercisable.  \n245  Subsection (5)  provides that, in the case of highways comprised in the land specified in the \ntable in P aragraph 1  of Schedule 11 (where only subsoil lying more than 9 metres beneath the \nsurface level of the land can be acquired compulsorily), only subsoil which is more than 9 metres beneath the level of the surface may be taken under S ubsection (1) . \n246  Subsection (6)  makes it clear that the restrictions in the Clause  as regards the highway land \nspecified in the table in Schedule 12 or in P aragraph 1 of Schedule  11 do not prevent the \nnominated undertaker carrying out street works on those highways in exercise of the powers under the Bill.  \n247  Subsections (7)  to (9) provide that compensation is payable for any loss suffered as a result of \nthe taking and use of subsoil under this Clause , with any disputes about such compensation \nto be determined under the Land Compensation Act 1961. T his does not apply to cases \nrelating to statutory undertakers which are covered by the costs sharing regime in section 85 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.  \nSchedule 12: Highways: restrictions on powers to use subsoils and acquire land  \n248  Schedule 12 contains the table referred to in Clause  8. The table specifies the highway land in \nrespect of which the power of compulsory acquisition or to appropriate subsoil is not \nexercisable. \nClause  9: Termination of power to acquire land  \n249  Clause  9 Subsection (1)  provides that the compulsory purchase power conferred by Clause 4(1) \nis to expire 8 years from the date when the Bill receives Royal Assent.  \n250  Subsection (2)  gives the Secretary of State the power by order to extend the period of 8  years  \nthat is specified in S ubsection (1). The period may only be extended once in relation to any \nparticular land, and for a maximum of an additional 2  years.  \n251  Under Subsection (3) , any order extending the time limit for the exercise of the compulsory \nacquisition powers is subject to a modified form of special parliamentary procedure under the \nStatutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act 1945. The arrangements for the making of such  an \norder are set out in  Subsections ( 4) to (7) of Clause 9. \n252  Subsection ( 6) provides that the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act 1945 has effect in \nrelation to an order under S ubsection (2)  with the specified amendments . \n253  Subsection ( 7) introduces Schedule 13, which gives rights to landowners to require acquisition \nof their land where an order is made extending the time limit in relation to the land. \nSchedule 13: Rights to require acquisition  \n30 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

The Schedule enables a person with a qualifying interest in the land to which the \norder relates to bring the period of uncertainty to an end.   \n255  Paragraphs 1 to 3 provide that a person with a qualifying interest in any land may give a notice \nto the Secretary of State stating the person desires the Secretary of State to acquire the person’s \ninterest in the land. Such a notice can be served on the Secretary of State between 5 and 8 \nyears from Royal Assent. Paragraph 4  provides that the Secretary of State must then within \nthree months of receipt of the notice either agree to acquire the person’s interest in the whole \nor part of the land, exercise the applicable compulsory acquisition powers in respect of the \nperson’s interest in the whole or part of the land, or notify the person that the Secretary of \nState does not intend to proceed with the purchase of the person’s interest in any of the land. \nIf the Secretary of State makes an order under Clause 9(2), Subsection (2) of that Clause  \nprovides that an order made has effect from the date that the order comes into force and is \noperative until the expiry of the period provided for in the order .  \n256  Paragraph 5(1)  provides that if the Secretary of State either fails to comply with the \nrequirements of paragraph 4, or notifies the person that the Secretary of State does not intend \nto purchase the land, the compulsory acquisition powers cease to be exercisable in respect of \nthe person’s interest.  \n257  Paragraph 5(2) applies where notice is given to the Secretary of State under Paragraphs 1(2) or \n2(2) and the Secretary of State proposes either to use compulsory purchase powers or enter \ninto an agreement pursuant to Paragraph 4  in respect of some but not all of a person’s interest \nin the land specified in the notice, the applicable compulsory purchase powers would cease to \nbe exercisable in respect of that person’s interest in the remainder of that land that is not \nsubject to acquisition under Paragraph 4(a) or (b).   \n258  Paragraph 6 applies where a person gives notice to the Secretary of State under Paragraph 1(2) \nor 2(2), the Secretary of State proposes to use compulsory purchase powers in respect of a \nperson’s interest in the whole or part of the land but the compulsory purchase powers, apart \nfrom this paragraph, cease to be exercisable before the end of the 3 month period specified in \nParagraph 4  by virtue of section 9(1). Paragraph 6(2)  provides that, notwithstanding Section \n9(1), the applicable compulsory purchase acquisition powers will remain until the end of the 3  \nmonth period mentioned in P aragraph 4 . Paragraph 6(3)  states that Paragraph 6(2)  is subject to \nParagraph 5 which applies to the period extended under Paragraph 6(2).  \n259  Paragraph 7 provides that the Paragraphs 1  to 6 do not apply to land where construction is \ntaking place more than 4.5 metres below the level of the surface of the land.   \n260  Paragraph 8(1)  sets out what “applicable compulsory acquisition powers” means in this \nSchedule . \n261  Paragraph 8(2)  defines the terms “lessee” and “owner”. \nPart 3: Extinction and Exclusion of Rights over Land  \nClause  10: Extinction of rights over lan d \n262  Clause  10 introduces Schedule 14, which relates to the extinction of private and other rights \nover land.  \nSchedule 14: Extinction of rights over land  \n31 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

These \ninclude private rights of way, rights of common and restrictions as to the user of land.   \n265  Paragraph 2  provides the general position that private rights over land within the Act limits \nwhich is held by the Secretary of State for Phase 2b (Crewe -  Manchester) purposes are \nextinguished. Where only rights are acquired, or restrictive covenants imposed, for Phase 2b  \n(Crewe – Manchester) purposes in relation to land within the Act limits, private rights are \nonly extinguished if they are inconsistent with the exercise of the acquired right or the \nrestrictive covenant.  \n266  Paragraphs 3(1) and (2)  enable the Secretary of State to direct that any particular private right is \nnot to be extinguished under P aragraph 2 , either wholly or in part.  \n267  Paragraph 3(3)  sets out circumstances where P aragraph 2  does not apply , and rights are not \nextinguished. These include rights of statutory undertakers in relation to their apparatus \n268  Paragraph 4  provides that compensation is payable to anyone who suffers loss due to the \nextinguishment of private rights under the Schedule. Disputes about such compensation are \nto be determined under the Land Compensation Act 1961.

The \nnominated undertaker may extinguish these rights as if the land had been acquired under \nPart 9 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.   \n280  Subsections (2) to (4) make modifications to sections 271 to 273 (and related provisions) of the \n1990 Act so that references to the acquiring authority refer to the nominated undertaker. \nClause  12: Exclusion of new rights of way \n281  Clause  12 Subsection (1)  prevents rights of way from being acquired by prescription or user \nover  land which forms an access or approach to any railway infrastructure , and which is \nacquired or held for Phase 2b  (Crewe - Manchester)  purposes.

However, this is subject to the exceptions \nin Paragraph 2(1) .  \n288  Paragraph  1(3) provides that the reference in Paragraph 1 (1)(a)  to the specified authorised \nworks also includes a reference to any works undertaken in connection with the works specified in column (4)  of the table in Schedule 16.  \nExceptions  \n289  Paragraph 2(1) disapplie s Paragraph 1(2) in relation to land which is subject to the specified \nrestrictions.  \n290  Paragraph  2(2) applies Paragraph s 2(1)(b) and 2(1)(c) only to land where notice of entry has been \nserved on all interests in the land.  \n291  Paragraph s 2(3), 2(4)  and 2(5) provide that the powers of compulsory acquisition under \nParagraph 4(1)  which are exercisable in relation to the land specified in the table in Schedule 16 \nare restricted to the acquisition of rights or the imposition of covenants (in which case the land \nmust also be included in the table in Schedule 8 ), or the acquisition of subsoil or under -surface \n(in which case the land must also be included in the table in P aragraph 1  of Schedule 11).   \nPowers exercisable on land of which temporary possession has been taken \n292  Paragraph 3  provides that , where temporary possession is taken , the nominated undertaker \nmay clear the site and construct certain works on the land including landscaping and other \nenvironmental mitigation works involving the planting of trees and shrubs and the provision \nof replacement habitat for wild animals . \nProcedure and compensation  \n293  Paragraph 4 (1) requires that at least 28 days’ notice must be given to the owners and occupiers \nof the land before possession is taken .  \n294  Paragraph 4(2) provides  that the nominated undertaker cannot remain on the land for longer \nthan one year from the completion of the work for which possession was taken unless the \nowners agree otherwise.  \n295  Under Paragraphs 4(3) and 4(4), Paragraph 4(2)  does not apply if before the end of the one -year \nperiod, powers under either Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act  1965 or under section 4 of \nthe Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981 have  been used. An estate or land \ninterest is relevant if the interest entitles a person to take possession of the specified land.  \n296  Paragraphs  4(5) to 4(7) set out the requirements for compensation payable under this Schedule . \nCompensation is payable for any loss suffered as a result of the exercise of the powers, with \n34 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

The \nundertaker must give at least 28 days’ notice to the owners and occupiers of the land before \npossession is taken, may only remain in possession of such land as long as is reasonably \nnecessary to carry out the maintenance works and must, before giving up possession, restore \nthe land to the reasonable satisfaction of its owners. Compensation is payable for any loss \nsuffered as a result of such use, with any disputes about such compensation to be determined \nunder the Land Compensation Act 1961.  \nPart 3 – Suspension or rights and enforcement  \nSuspension of rights relation to land  \n301  Paragraph 8  provides for private rights (including rights of way, rights of common and \nrestrictions as to user) over land of which temporary possession is taken under the Schedule \nto be suspended during the period of possession. This is subject to any direction to the \ncontrary made by the nominated undertaker. Compensation is payable to anyone who suffers \nloss as a result of any such suspension, with any disputes about such compensation to be \ndetermined under the Land Compensation Act 1961.  \n302  Paragraph 9  similarly provides for all general rights over land of which temporary possession \nis taken to be suspended during the period of possession. This is subject to any direction to \nthe contrary made by the nominated undertaker. The general rights to which P aragraph 9  \napplies include rights of access to, or other public rights over, the land under any enactment \nand rights exercisable under trusts over commons, town or village greens, open space or \nallotments . \nEnforcement  \n35 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 303  Paragraph 10 applies section 13 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965  to make  provision for \nthe enforcement of required possession, should the owner or occupier of the land in question \nrefuse to give up, or hinder the taking of, possession.  \nSchedule 16: temporary  possession and use of land: table of land  \n304  The table in this Schedule identifies the land referred to in Schedule 15 of which temporary \npossession may be taken . \nClause  14: Use of roads  \n305  Clause  14 Subsection  (1) confers on the nominated undertaker a power to use any roads on the \nland specified in the table in S chedule 7 for the passage of persons or vehicles for Phase 2b \n(Crewe to Manchester) purposes.  \n306  Under Subsection s (2) and (3) at least 7 days’ notice  (or, where access is urgently required, such \nnotice as is reasonably practicable)  must normally be given before the first use of a road under \nthis power.  \n307  Under Subsection  (4), this power ends 5 years after railway works authorised by the Bill are \nbrought into general use. Under S ubsection s (5) and (6), compensation is payable to the person \nresponsible for managing the road for any loss suffered as a result of the use of it, with any \ndisputes about such compensation to be determined under the Lands Compensation Act 1961.  \nClause  15: Cranes  \n308  Clause  15 Subsection s (1) and (2)  allow the nominated undertaker to enter upon and use \nairspace above the surface of any land within the Act limits for the oversailing of cranes for Phase 2b (Crewe –  Manchester) purposes, provided that 7 days’ notice has been given to the \nowners and occupiers of the land.  \n309  Under Subsection (3) , the nominated undertaker may not, without the agreement of the owners \nof the land, use the airspace in this manner after the end of 7 days following the completion of \nactivities for which the crane has been used. This allows for the prompt removal of apparatus.  \n310  Under Subsection (4) , the nominated undertaker must pay compensation to the owners and \noccupiers of land above which the power is exercised for any losses caused as a result of the power being exercised. Subsections (5)  and (6) add that disputes around entitlement to \ncompensation must be determined under and in accordance with Part 1 of the Land Compensation Act 1961, and that liability to pay compensation under section 10(2) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 remains unchanged by this section. Subsection (7)  adds that the \npower in subsection (1)  does not apply to airspace above a highway.  \nClause  16: Enforcement of restrictions on land use  \n311  Clause  16 enables covenants between the Secretary of State and persons with an interest in \nland entered into by agreement to bind successors in title to such interests even though they \nare not direct parties to the original covenant.    \n312  In order for covenants concerning land to be enforceable against successors in title to such \nland, the person claiming the benefit must usually have a neighbouring interest in land. The \nSecretary of State will usually not have such an interest until compulsory purchase powers are \nexercised. Therefore, to enable covenants which bind successors in title to be entered into before that time, this Clause  16 Subsection (2)  removes the requirement to have a neighbouring \ninterest in land.  \n36 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 313  Subsection (1)  sets out the conditions in which the power to enforce restrictions applies, while \nSubsection (3)  disapplies Section 2(c) of the Local Land Charges Act 1975, under which a \nprohibition or  restriction enforceable by a Minister of the Crown under a covenant or  \nagreement is not a local land charge if binding on successive owners because  made for the \nbenefit of land of the Minister . \nClause  17: Compensation for injurious affection  \n314  Clause  17 modifies section 10(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 which provides for \ncompensation for ‘injurious affection’ by the acquiring authority. The compulsory purchase \npowers under the Bill are given to the Secretary of State and not the nominated undertaker. \nThe modification of section 10 of the 1965 Act is needed to make the nominated undertaker, who is not the acquiring authority, responsible for the payment of compensation for injurious \naffection.  Injurious affection has a specific and detailed meaning developed by case law. In \nvery broad terms, injurious affection under section 10 of the 1965 Act relates to circumstances \nwhere the construction of public works such as HS2 causes a diminution in the value of land.  \nPart 5: Planning  \nClause  18: Deemed planning permission  \n315  Clause  18 Subsections (1)  deem planning permission under Part 3 of the Town and Country \nPlanning Act 1990 to be granted for development authorised by the Bill, subject to the other \nprovisions of the Bill and the conditions set out in Schedule 17 . The conditions are enforceable \nby the relevant planning authority.   \n316  Subsection (2)  provides that this permission does not apply to ancillary development not \ncomprising a scheduled work, if that development would be likely to have significant effects \non the environment, unless it is an exempt development or has been appropriately assessed in \nthe Environmental Statement for the Bill.  \n317  Subsection (3) introduces Schedule 17, which imposes conditions on deemed planning \npermission under  Subsection (1) . \n318  Subsection (4)  classifies this planning permission as “specific planning permission” for the \npurposes of treating the land within Bill limits as operational land of a statutory undertaker.  \n319  Subsection (5)  ensures that, where works are carried out by the nominated undertaker, the \nconditions in Schedule 17 apply instead of  permitted development rights under the normal \nplanning regime.  \nSchedule 17: Conditions of deemed planning permission  \nPart 1 – Conditions  \n320  Schedule 17 sets out conditions  which apply to the planning permission granted by Clause  \n18(1) . \nConditions relating to building works  \n321  Where a building (other than a temporary building) is to be constructed, altered,  or extended \nunder the Bill, P aragraph 2  requires this to be done in accordance with plans and specifications \napproved by the relevant planning authority (which , in a non- unitary area , is the district \ncouncil). Paragraph 2(3)  and (4) enable the authority, when approving these, to require plans \nand specifications showing additional details of the building works to be submitted, in order \nto permit approvals of the plans and specifications to be staged. Paragraph 2(5)  and (6) set out \n37 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Qualifying authorities \nmay in addition refuse approval or apply conditions on road and heritage grounds. Under \nParagraph 2(7) , conditions may only be imposed by the authority on approval on a ground \nreferred to in sub -paragraph (5)  or (6).   \nConditions relating to other construction works  \n322  Where the relevant planning authority is a qualifying authority, (see Part 2 of Schedule 18) \nParagraph 3  requires similar approvals in relation to other construction works which are part \nof Phase 2b, namely certain road vehicle parks, earthworks, screens, fences, walls,  lighting, \ntransformers, telecommunications masts , and pedestrian accesses. Similar provision to that in \nParagraph 2  about additional details, grounds of refusal (set out in a detailed table)  and \nconditions  on approval  are applied to these construction works.  \nConditions relating to matters ancillary to development  \n323  Paragraph 4  sets out certain construction arrangements which require the approval of the \nrelevant planning authority if that authority is a qualifying authority, including the handling \nof re -useable spoil or top soil, storage sites, construction camps, screening, artificial lighting, \nand the suppression of dust and mud on the highway. The paragraph also sets out the \ngrounds on which approval can be refused or conditions applied. Under sub -paragraph (7) , \nconditions may only be imposed by the authority on approval for the purposes specified in \nthe table in sub -paragraph (6) (b) in relation to the work in question.  \n324  Paragraph 5  enables the Secretary of State, after consulting the affected planning authorities, to \nissue a class approval for these construction arrangements, except in relation to construction camps. Where a class approval is in effect, by virtue of P aragraph 5(5)  the nominated \nundertaker does not need to seek specific approval from the planning authority under \nParagraph 4 , although if the circumstances of the case require it the nominated undertaker can \nstill apply for that approval by virtue of P aragraph 5(6)  and (7). \nConditions relating to road transport  \n325  Under Paragraph 6 , if the relevant authority (which is the county council in a non- unitary area) \nis a qualifying authority, it has some control over the routes by which large goods vehicles \ntravel by road to and from working, storage , and waste disposal sites which are used under \nthe planning permission conferred by the Bill. Paragraph 6(3) and (7) provide that this applies \nonly to the part of the route between the site and the nearest special road or trunk road and on \ndays on which there are 24 or more large goods vehicle movements in a day. The paragraph \nalso sets out the grounds on which approval can be refused or conditions applied. Under \nParagraph 6( 6), conditions require the agreement of the nominated undertaker.  \nConditions relating to waste and spoil disposal and evacuation  \n326  Where the relevant planning authority is a qualifying authority, Paragraph 7 requires waste \nand spoil disposal and the excavation of bulk materials from borrow pits to be done in \naccordance with plans and specifications approved by that authority (which in a non- unitary \narea is the county council). Paragraph 7(4)  and (5) enable the authority, when approving these, \nto require plans and specifications showing additional details to be submitted, in order to \npermit approvals of the plans and specifications to be staged. Paragraph 7(6)  to (9) sets out the \ngrounds on which approval can be refused or conditions applied. Under P aragraph 7(10) , \nconditions require the agreement of the nominated undertaker.   \n327  Paragraph 8  further provides that before development to which P aragraph 7  applies is begun, \n38 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Under P aragraph 8(3)  approval \nmay only be refused on the ground that the scheme ought to be and is reasonably capable of \nbeing modified. Paragraph 8(5)  enables the scheme to make provision about aftercare. \nConditions on bringing scheduled works and depots into use  \n328  Paragraph 9  provides that where the relevant planning authority (which is the district council \nin non- unitary areas) is a qualifying authority, scheduled works which are not underground \nand certain depots cannot be brought into use without the approval of the of the authority. \nUnder Paragraph 9(4) , approval must be granted if no further environmental mitigation is \nrequired or the authority has approved a mitigation scheme submitted by the nominated \nundertaker. Paragraph 9(5)  sets out the grounds on which approval of such a scheme may be \nrefused or conditions imposed.  \n329  Paragraph 10 requires such a mitigation scheme to be implemented in accordance with any \nconditions subject to which approval was given.  \nConditions relating to discontinuation of ancillary operations  \n330  Paragraph 11 requires operations on ancillary works sites to cease as soon as reasonably \npracticable after the scheduled works to which they relate have been completed.  \nConditions relating to site restoration  \n331  After such cessation, P aragraph 12 requires a site which has been materially altered by the \nconstruction operations  to be restored in accordance with a scheme agreed with the relevant \nplanning authority (which is the district council in a non -unitary area). Under Paragraph 12(3)  \nthis must be submitted by the nominated undertaker within four months of the cessation. By \nvirtue of P aragraph 12(6) , a scheme may reserve particulars for subsequent agreement.  \n332  If no restoration scheme or reserved particular is agreed within the period required (or as \nextended by agreement by the nominated undertaker and planning authority), under \nparagraph 12(4)  and (7) it is determined by the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing \nand Communities and Secretary of State for Transport acting jointly. Paragraph 12(8)  makes \nprovision about costs if that happens.  \n333  Under paragraph 12(9) , the requirement for a restoration scheme does not apply where the Bill \nimposes other requirements with respect to restoration. \nPart 2 – Qualifying  authorities  \nSpecification of qualifying authorities  \n334  Paragraph 13 requires the Secretary of State, by means of regulations, to name “qualifying \nauthorities” for the purposes of Schedule 17. These are the local planning authorities which, by \nthe time the Bill is reported from the Select Committee in the House of Lords, have given the \nSecretary of State satisfactory undertakings about the handling of planning requests.  \n335  Paragraph 13 also allows the Secretary of State to make orders revoking “qualifying authority” \nstatus and to make subsequent naming orders in certain circumstances. Before making such an order, the Secretary of State is to consult the nominated undertaker and, if it is not the body \nrequesting the order, the relevant local planning authority.  \nTransition  \n336  Paragraph 14 allows for any order under P aragraph 13 to set out any transitional arrangements \n39 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n that may be necessary (for example, were a local planning authority to cease to be a qualifying \nauthority for the purposes of the Bill whilst a number of undetermined planning applications \nwere before it). \nPart 3 – Approvals: Supplementary  \n337  This part of the Schedule deals with supplementary matters concerning the giving of \napprovals under Part 1, including appeals.  \nRequests for planning approval  \n338  Paragraph 15 provides that any approval under Part 1 may only be given at the request of the \nnominated undertaker. \n339  Paragraph 16  provides that the local planning authority is not required to consider  a request \nfor approval unless the nominated undertaker has first submitted a programme of the \napprovals it intends to seek from the authority, and an explanation of how the matters dealt \nwith in the request fit into the wider Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  scheme. This does not \napply to a request for approval of additional details.  \nFees for requests for approval  \n340  Paragraph 17 enables the Secretary of State for Transport and the Secretary of State for \nLevelling Up, Housing and Communities  jointly to make regulations about fees payable by \nthe nominated undertaker when making requests for approval. \nConsultation on requests for approval  \n341  Paragraph 18 sets out requirements for consultation where a request relates to things which \nmay affect certain conservation, recreational or heritage matters. Where this is the case, the \nplanning authority must consult Natural England, the Environment Agency, the Canal & \nRiver Trust, or Historic England, as appropriate, before giving an approva l. The description of \nthe matters on which Historic England is to be consulted may be updated by regulations to \nreflect a change in the regime for designating matters of heritage or historic interest . \nEnvironmental requirements  \n342  Paragraph 19 requires planning authorities making decisions as to approvals under this \nSchedule to have regard to environmental requirements which the Secretary of State has \nimposed on the nominated undertaker and given an undertaking to Parliament to enforce. \nDirections restricting powers of approval and compulsory reference of requests for \napproval  \n343  Paragraphs 20 and 21 set out a mechanism for the Secretary of State for Transport and the \nSecretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities to issue directions restricting a \nplanning authority’s power to approve under the Schedule and to “call in” a particular \nrequest for approval. Paragraph 21( 5) makes clear that any challenge to a determination of a \n“called -in” application may only be made by way of judicial review and must be made within \n6 weeks of notification of the determination.  \nNon- material changes to approvals  \n344  Paragraph 2 2 enables a planning authority at the request of the nominated undertaker to make \na non- material change to any approval it has previously given under Part 1. This is to allow \nchanges which do not have material planning significance to be made without the necessity \n40 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n for the nominated undertaker to make a fresh request for approval. It is similar to the power \navailable to planning authorities in respect of “normal” planning permissions in section 96A \nof the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.  \nTermination of approva l relating to road transportation arrangements  \n345  Under paragraph 2 3, arrangements relating to transportation under P aragraph 6  cease to have \neffect at the end of the relevant period, provided that the nominated undertaker gives a termination notice to the planning authority which approved the arrangements.  \nAppeals  \n346  Paragraphs 2 4 to 27 make provision about appeals to the Secretary of State for Transport and \nthe Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities  acting jointly, where the \nnominated undertaker is aggrieved by a decision of the planning authority on a request for approval.  The nominated undertaker may appeal within 42 days of the decision or of the \nperiod for making a decision having ended. The period for making a decision is 8 weeks unless a longer period is agreed between the nominated undertaker and the planning \nauthority  or a longer period is notified to the planning authority by the nominated \nundertaker. The Secretaries of State may make regulations prescribing the form to be used when appealing, and about the decision period in cases where fees are paid by cheque. \n347  Paragraph 26 provides that a decision on an appeal is final. It may only be challenged by way \nof judicial review proceedings which must be brought within six weeks of notification of the \ndecision.  \n348  An appeal is determined by an appointed person unless the Secretaries of State direct that \nthey should decide it. An appeal is decided by written representations unless the person \ndeciding it thinks a hearing is required.  \n349  Under Paragraph 2 7(2) to (4), the Secretary of State for Transport and the Secretary of State for \nLevelling Up, Housing and Communities may make regulations about the procedure to be \nfollowed with respect to appeals.  \nGuidance by Secretary of State  \n350  Paragraph 2 8 enables the Secretary of State for Transport and the Secretary of State for \nLevelling Up, Housing and Communities  to give guidance to planning authorities about the \nexercise of their functions under the Schedule. The authorities must have regard to the guidance.  \nPart 4 – Supplementary and general  \nRegulations  \n351  Paragraph 2 9 makes supplementary provision about regulations and orders under the \nSchedule. These are to be made by statutory instrument. Regulations, and orders changing the \nlist of qualifying authorities after the first order specifying them has been made, are subject to \nannulment by resolution of either House of Parliament.  \nInterpretation  \n352  Paragraph 30 defines terms used in this Schedule.   \nClause  19: Time limit on deemed planning permission  \n353  Clause  19 Subsection (1)  provides that, for scheduled works, the deemed planning permission \n41 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

A  requirement for development consent under the 2008 Act \nwould be inappropriate for works which already have the specific authorisation of Parliament.  \nPart 6: Deregulation  \nClause  22: Listed buildings and Ancient Monuments  \n359  Clause  22 introduces Schedule 18, which disapplies and modifies various controls relating to \nlisted buildings and Schedule 19 , which disapplies and modifies various controls relating to \nancient monuments.  \nSchedule 18: Listed buildings  \n360  Schedule 18 concerns how legislation in respect of listed buildings under the Planning (Listed \nBuildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”) applies to the Phase 2b works.  \nBuildings authorised to be demolished, altered or extended  \n361  Paragraph 1(2)  disapplies some of this legislation, and in particular the requirement for listed \nbuilding consent, from the Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  works in respect of the listed \nbuildings set out in table 1 , or which are listed after 24 January 2022.  \n362  Paragraph 1(3)  provides that for the buildings specified in table 1  which have a description of \nworks in column (3)  of the table, the disapplication of the requirement for listed building \nconsent only applies, as regards works of demolition or alteration which do not comprise \nworks to maintain or restore their character or for the affixing of monitoring apparatus, to \nworks falling within that description.  \nBuildings authorised to be altered or extended for heritage or monitoring purposes  \n363  Paragraph 2  disapplies legislation from the Phase 2b works in respect of those listed buildings \n42 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Under P aragraph 7(3) , these rights are not to be exercised if the \nnominated undertaker considers that it is not safe to do so. Paragraph 7(4)  provides that any \nperson exercising the rights will have to comply with directions from the nominated \nundertaker in respect of compliance with health and safety requirements.   \nRecording of buildings  \n369  Paragraph 8  requires the nominated undertaker to give notice to Historic England of the \ndemolition of a building that would require listed building consent, to allow recording prior to demolition. Under P aragraph 8(2) , at least eight weeks’ notice is required, or longer if agreed \nby the nominated undertaker . However, in cases of emergency , shorter notice can be given, \nunder paragraph 8(3) .   \n370  Paragraph 9 (1) provides that where notice has been given under P aragraph 8  anyone authorised \nby Historic England may enter the building concerned to do the recording during the notice \nperiod.   \n371  Paragraph 9(2)  and (3) provide that this right is not to be exercised if the nominated undertaker \nconsiders that it not safe to do so, and any person exercising the right will have to comply \nwith directions from the nominated undertaker in respect of compliance with health and \nsafety requirements.  \nInterpretation  \n372  Paragraph 10(1)  contains definitions of terms used in Schedule 18 and the ways in which they \nshould be applied.

This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n Schedule 19: Ancient monuments  \n373  Schedule 19 concerns how legislation in respect of ancient monuments applies to Phase 2b \nworks.  \nDisapplication of controls  \n374  Paragraph 1  modifies the application of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act \n1979 (“the 1979 Act”) in respect of Phase 2b works.  \n375  Paragraph 1(2)  provides that section 2 of the 1979 Act does not apply to works authorised by \nthe Bill.  \n376  Paragraph 1(3)  provides that the powers of entry conferred by sections 6(1), 6A(1) and 26 of the \n1979 Act are not to be exercisable in relation to land used for or in connection with the \ncarrying out of such works.  \n377  Paragraph 1(4)  provides that the functions of a guardian under the 1979 Act and the provisions \nof an agreement under section 17 have effect subject to the powers of the Bill.   \n378  Paragraph 1(5)  disapplies section 19 of the 1979 Act where a monument is closed by the \nnominated undertaker for works authorised under the Bill, meaning that public access will no longer be available.   \n379  Paragraph 1(6)  disapplies regulations under section 19(3) or (4A) of the 1979 Act in relation to \nPhase 2b works, so removing restrictions on things which may injure or disfigure the \nmonument in question for Phase 2b. Paragraph 1(7)  provides that the power conferred by \nsection 19(6) of that Act to restrict access is not to be exercisable so as to prevent or restrict the \nundertaking of the works authorised by this Bill.    \n380  Paragraph 1(8)  prevents superintendence under section 25 of the 1979 Act of the carrying out \nof any of the Phase 2b works, and provides that English Heritage may not charge for advice in relation to the undertaking of these works.    \n381  Paragraph 1(9)  to (13) disapplies sections 28 (offence of damaging certain ancient monuments), \n35 (notice of operations in areas of archaeological importance), 39(1) (power to investigate in \nadvance of operations notice), 42(1) (use of metal detectors) and 42(3) (removal of objects \ndiscovered by metal detector) of the 1979 Act, in relation to the works authorised by this Bill.   \n382  Paragraph 2  modifies the application of the National Heritage Act 1983 to the Phase 2b works. \nThe power of entry conferred by section 36(1) of the 1983 Act is only to be exercisable in \nrelation to land used, or intended for use, for or in connection with the Phase 2b works with \nthe consent of the nominated undertaker, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Such consent may be given subject to compliance with any reasonable requirements or conditions \nimposed for reasons of safety or for the purpose of preventing interference with or delay to \nthe works. Section 36(6) of the 1983 Act, which regulates the right to enter land for the \npurposes of record keeping, will not apply to land on which works authorised by the Bill are \nbeing carried out. Any disputes about this are to be determined by the Secretary of State for \nTransport and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, acting jointly.  \nPower to disapply provision made by P aragraphs 1 and 2  \n383  Paragraph 3  allows the Secretary of State, once the initial construction phase is over, by \nregulations made by statutory instrument, to restore the operation of some of the provisions \nof the 1979 and 1983 Acts referred to in P aragraphs 1  and 2 for subsequent maintenance and \n44 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Paragraph 4(2)  and (3) provide that \nthis right is not to be exercised if the nominated undertaker considers that it not safe to do so. \nAny person exercising the right will have to comply with directions on the health and safety \nrequirements given by the nominated undertaker.   \nInterpretation  \n385  As stated in P aragraph 5 , references to “the Commission” in Schedule 19 are to the Historic \nBuildings and Monuments Commission for England.  \nClause  23: Burial grounds  \n386  Clause  23 Subsection s (1) and (2)  state that no conditions or restrictions appl y to the use of any \nland comprised in a burial ground for the purpose of constructing any of the  Phase 2b (Crewe \n– Manchester)  works , except in such cases where the use of the land would involve disturbing \nany human remains or monuments to the deceased that have not been dealt with in accordance with Schedule 20 . \n387  Subsection (3)  defines the terms “burial ground” and “monument” for both Clause 23 and \nSchedule 20.  \nSchedule 20: Burial grounds  \nNotice of removal of remains or monument  \n388  Paragraph 1  requires the nominated undertaker to publish and display notice of the intention \nto remove any human remains or monuments before any such removal, and sets out what such a notice should contain,  including an explanation that a personal representative or \nrelative may within 56 days apply, as per P aragraph 2(1) , for a licence to remove the remains \nand monument themselves. No notice is required in cases where the Secretary of State has notified the nominated undertaker that the Secretary of State is satisfied that the remains were \nburied more than 100 years ago and that no relative or representative of the deceased is likely \nto object  (Paragraph 1(3)) . Nor is a notice required in cases where the nominated undertaker \nhas been granted a faculty in relation to the remains by a court, or already holds a licence to \nremove human remains under section 25 of the Burial Act 1857. “Relative” is defined in \nParagraph 11.   \nRemoval of remains under licence  \n389  Paragraph 2  sets out the circumstances in which the nominated undertaker must, upon written \napplication by a relative or personal representative of the deceased, issue a licence to \nauthorise the removal and reburying or cremation of the remains. The reasonable costs of \nremoval and reburial or cremation must be paid by the nominated undertaker.  \nRemoval of remains by nominated undertaker  \n390  Paragraphs 3  and 4 allow the nominated undertaker to remove human remains where no \nwritten application for a license by a relative or personal representative is received, or where a \nlicense has been issued but the remains have not been removed within 28 days. For remains  in \nrelation  to which Paragraph 1 (1) applies, the remains must, within 2 months, be buried in a \n45 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

The meaning of “the relevant day” is defined in \nParagraph 12.  \n392  However, if remains  (to which P aragraph 1(3)  applies)  are identified in consultation with the \nHistoric Buildings and Monuments Commission for England  (the Commission)  or the \nArchbishop s’ Council as being of historical or archaeological interest , then the period is \nextended to 5 years ( beginning with the relevant day)  to enable archaeological or other studies \nto be carried out where appropriate. In addition, for remains removed from non -consecrated \nland,  the nominated undertaker may  make arrangements in consultation with the \nCommission to have the remains transferred to a museum, archive, or similar institution \ninstead of having the remains buried or cremated within this period.   \n393  Provision is made under P aragraphs 3(3)  and (4) and 4(6) and (7) for cases where a question as \nto an applicant’s entitlement to be granted a license has been referred to a court but has not \nyet been determined. \n394  Paragraph 5  applies where the nominated undertaker already holds a licence to remove \nremains under section 25 of the Burial Act 1857. In such a case , the nominated undertaker may \nremove the remains but is subject to the same requirements as under Paragraph s 3 and 4 to \nbury them, cremate them or, for remains to which P aragraph 1(3)  applies, to  arrange for them \nto be transferred to a museum, archive or similar institution (if they are of archaeological or historical interest), or  deal with them in another manner specified by the Secretary of State. \nRemoval of monuments  \n395  Paragraph 6  sets out the arrangements to apply to the removal of any monument associated \nwith human remains removed under the Schedule. Where a licence has been issued to the \nrelative or personal representative of the deceased, the licensee may also remove any \nmonument to the deceased, re- erect it elsewhere or dispose of it. The reasonable costs of doing \nso must be paid by the nominated undertaker.  \n396  Paragraph 7  allows the nominated undertaker, where human remains have been removed by \nthe nominated undertaker under the Schedule, also to remove any monument to the deceased. Where remains have been removed under a licence but a monument to the deceased has not \nbeen removed within 28 days, the monument may be removed by the nominated undertaker. \nThe nominated undertaker can also remove any monument to a deceased person whose \nremains have been removed under a licence under section 25 of the Burial Act 1857 which is not removed by the licensee. Monuments which are removed by the nominated undertaker \nmay be re- erected at the place where the remains are reburied or removed to some other \nappropriate place. If that is not done, they are to be broken up and defaced to prevent \ninappropriate use.  \nRecords  \n397  Paragraph 8  sets out the records required to be kept by the nominated undertaker as respects \nhuman remains or monuments removed under the Schedule. Records as to the removal of \nremains must be provided to the Registrar General within two months of their removal and \nrecords of the removal of a monument must be provided both to the Registrar General and to \n46 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

In the case of remains to which Paragraph 1 (3) applies, the period \nof two months is extended to 24 months, or such longer period as the Secretary of State may \ndirect, to enable archaeological or other studies to be carried out where appropriate. \nDischarge of functions by nominated undertaker  \n398  Paragraph 9  requires the nominated undertaker, in removing remains or monuments, to \ncomply with any reasonable request of a relative or personal representative of the deceased to \nwhom a license  has been granted under the Schedule. This is intended to apply to cases where \na license  has been issued to a relative or personal representative but, because the right to \nremove the remains or monument has not been exercised, the nominated undertaker does so. Provision is made for cases where more than one license  has been granted under the Schedule . \n399  Paragraph 10 enables the Secretary of State to make directions to the nominated undertaker \nwith respect to the carrying out of functions under the Schedule . \n400  Paragraphs 11 and 12 define terms used in this Schedule.  \nClause  24: Consecrated land  \n401  Clause  24 Subsection (1)  provides that no law, either ecclesiastical or otherwise which applies to \nconsecrated ground, is to restrict the works authorised by the Bill.  \n402  Subsection (2) makes clear that this provision does not apply to burial grounds, which are \ncovered by Clause 22 and Schedule  20.  \n403  Subsection  (3) states that “burial ground” has the same meaning as in Clause  23.  \nClause  25: Commons and open spaces  \n404  Clause  25 disapplies enactments which regulate the use of commons, town or village greens, \nopen spaces , or allotments. It provides that no such enactment prevents or restricts the doing \nof anything for Phase 2b (Crewe – Manchester) purposes on land held by the Secretary of \nState or the nominated undertaker for those purposes, the exercise of any right of entry under \nthe Bill or the doing of anything in exercise of any other power of the Bill. This allows the \ncarrying out of works for Phase 2b (Crewe – Manchester)  purposes which would otherwise be \nin breach of such enactments.  \nClause  26: Trees  \n405  Clause  26 Subsection  (2) specifies that  tree preservation orders made under section 198(1) or \n202(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and regulations made under section 202A \nof that Act, and the provisions of section 211 of that Act dealing with trees in conservation \nareas, are disapplied  in relation to certain tree works.  \n406  Subsection (1) specif ies that these disapplications are specifically for  works on trees within the \nAct limits that are carried out for the purposes of the construction of Phase 2b, and also to \nworks on trees growing on any other land used for Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  purposes \nwhich are necessary for the maintenance or operation of Phase 2b, or for safety reasons.  \n407  Subsection (3)  sets out what is meant by “tree works” in this context.  \nClause  27: Overhead lines  \n408  Clause  27 relates to the installation and diversion of overhead lines.  \n409  Subsection (1)  removes the need for the Secretary of State’s consent under the Electricity Act \n1989 where the overhead line work concerned is within the Act limits, is work authorised by \n47 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Instead, the decision whether to hold a public \ninquiry is to be a matter for the Secretary of State after considering whether the number and \nsubstance of any objections require one.  \n411  Under Subsection (3) , Subsection (1)  applies where the work concerned is done by a person \nother than the nominated undertaker if the work would be authorised by the Bill and would \nhave deemed planning permission if carried out by the nominated undertaker.   \n412  Under Subsection (4) , development consent under the Planning Act 2008 is not required for \nelectric line work done in consequence of the Phase 2b (Crewe – Manchester) works, even if \ncarried out by the electricity undertaker.  \nClause  28: Water  \n413  Clause  28 introduces Schedule 21  which provides for the disapplication of certain legislation \nrelating to water.  \nSchedule 21: Water  \n414  Schedule 21 contains provisions relating to the treatment of water sources and features in \nrelation to this Bill. These generally disapply a restriction or requirement to obtain a further \nconsent for works which are authorised by the Bill.    \nWater abstraction and impounding  \n415  Paragraphs 1 and 2 disapply sections of the Water Resources Act 1991 with regards to works \nauthorised by this Bill. These provisions require consent for the abstraction or impoundment \nof water. The requirement for consent for abstraction is disapplied in relation to the \nconstruction of works and the requirement for consent for impoundment is disapplied in \nrelation to the exercise of any powers with respect to works. \n416  Paragraph 3  relates to loss or damage caused by the abstraction of water. Section 48A(1) of the \nWater Resources Act 1991 is disapplied in relation to any power authorised by this Bill. If the \nnominated undertaker does cause loss or damage and the conditions around this would have \nbreached the duty in section 48A(1), then the nominated undertaker must compensate the \naffected party, under P aragraph 3(2) . Paragraph 3(3)  states how such compensation should be \ndetermined.   \n417  Paragraph 3(4)  disapplies the prohibition under section 48A(5) of the Water Resources Act 1991 \non making claims in respect of loss or damage. This allows for claims for compensation to be \nmade under this paragraph of this Bill and those others listed.   \nNo environmental permit required for operating regulated facility etc  \n418  Paragraph 4  disapplies the requirement for an environmental permit for flood risk activities, \nwater discharges or groundwater activities carried out in the exercise of the powers of this Bill.   \nFloods  \n48 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

For any which refer to another Act, please see the definition in \nthe relevant piece of legislation.  \nClause  29: Buildings  \n424  Subsection (1)  introduces Schedule 22 which provides for the disapplication or modification of \nvarious provisions of the Building Act 1984 and building regulations.  \n425  Subsection (2)  introduces Schedule 23 which provides for the modification of the Party Wall etc. \nAct 1996.  \nSchedule 22: Building s \n426  Schedule 22 disapplies and modifies provisions in the Building Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act”) and \nin building regulations where they would impede the use of powers for Phase 2b (Crewe – \nManchester) purposes.  \nBuilding regulations  \n427  Paragraph 1 (1) disapplies Part 1 of the 1984 Act with respect to other building regulations  \nunder section 1 of that Act  in relation to certain buildings held by the Secretary of State or by \nthe nominated undertaker and used for the purpose of the nominated undertaker’s undertaking under the Bill.  \n428  Under Paragraphs 1(2) and  1(3), sub-paragraph (1)  does not apply to houses, hotels, or offices or \nshowrooms, unless the offices or showrooms are part of a railway station or other railway \nfacility.  \n429  Paragraph 1(4) defines a “railway facility” as including a maintenance depot, electrical supply \nfacility or stabling facility.  \n430  Paragraph 1(5)  excludes certain requirements of the building regulations listed in regulation \n34(1) of the Building Regulations 2010 which relate to energy efficiency from the \ndisapplication.  \nDrain repairs  \n49 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 431  Paragraph 2  exempts works to drains carried out for Phase 2b (Crewe- Manchester) purposes \nfrom certain requirements under section 61 of the 1984 Act relating to the carrying out of \nworks to underground drains.  \nDrain disconnections  \n432  Paragraph 3  modifies section 62 of the 1984 Act which enables the local authority to impose \nrequirements as regards the reconstruction or disconnection of drains  and other drain  works \nthat are carried out for Phase 2b (Crewe –  Manchester) purposes , and substitutes a \nrequirement to give at least 48 hours’ notice to the local authority before carrying out the \nworks.  \nRaising of chimneys  \n433  Paragraph 4  modifies section 73 of the 1984 Act which makes provision for the protection of an \nowner (“the adjoining owner”) where a person (“the building owner”) erects or raises a building to a greater height than the chimney of an adjoining building. It applies where the \nnominated undertaker or Secretary of State own the taller building for the purpose of the \nnominated undertaker’s undertaking under the Bill and the nominated undertaker or \nSecretary of State is served a counter- notice by the adjoining owner.  \n434  Under sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) , the adjoining owner may not enter onto Phase 2b  (Crewe – \nManchester)  land to carry out the work without the consent of the Secretary of State or \nnominated undertaker.  \n435  Under Paragraph 4(5) , references to “the taller building” and “counter -notice” have the same \nmeaning as in section 73 of the 1984 Act.  \nConstruction of cellars and rooms below subsoil water level \n436  Paragraph 5(1)  extends the exemption in section 74(2) of the 1984 Act so that section 74(1) does \nnot apply to the construction of a cellar or room in connection with a shop, inn, hotel or office \nwhich forms part of a railway station or other railway facility which is used, or intended for \nuse, for the purpose of the nominated undertak er’s undertaking under the Bill.  \n437  Paragraph 5(2)  defines “railway facility” as a maintenance depot, electrical supply facility, or \nstabling facility used for railway purposes.  \nDemolition of whole or part of building  \n438  Paragraph 6  disapplies sections 80(2)(b), 81 and 82 of the 1984 Act (which allow a local \nauthority to impose requirements as to the demolition of a building)  to the demolition of the \nwhole or part of a building which is carried out under the powers in this Bill and to which \nsection 80 of the 1984 Act otherwise applies.  \nInterpretation  \n439  Paragraph 7  contains definition of terms used in Schedule 22 and the ways in which they should \nbe applied.   \nSchedule 23: Party  walls etc.  \n440  Schedule 23 disapplies or modifies various provisions of the Party Wall etc. Act 1996 (“the 1996 \nAct”) which affect Phase 2b  (Crewe to Manchester)  works.  \n50 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 441  Paragraph 2  modifies section 1 of the 1996 Act following service by the nominated undertaker \non an adjoining owner of a notice under section 1(2) of the 1996 Act.  For section 1(3) of the \n1996 Act is substituted a new subsection (3) which provides that a wall can be built half on the \nadjoining owner’s land at the expense of the nominated undertaker. Two new subsections are \nalso inserted after (3), namely (3A) and (3B) which provide for the placing of footings and \nfoundations  under the wall within a specified time after service of a notice in section 1(3) and \nthat the nominated undertaker must compensate the adjoining owner for any damage caused \nby the construction of the wall or the placing of footings and foundations referred to in \nsubsection (3A).     \n442  Paragraph 3  ensures that an adjoining landowner does not acquire any rights over Phase 2b  \n(Crewe to Manchester)  works under the 1996 Act.   \n443  Paragraph 4  removes the requirement under section 3 of the 1996 Act for the nominated \nundertaker to give notice to the adjoining landowner before carrying out works to certain \nwalls or other structures at the boundary of adjoining land. This applies where the works are \ncarried out in connection with the construction of Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  works or \nthe maintenance of such works within five years of Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  being \nbrought into general use.  \n444  Paragraph 5  removes the requirement under section 6 of the 1996 Act to obtain the consent of \nthe adjoining owner before carrying out any excavation or erection for Phase 2b  (Crewe – \nManchester)  purposes.   \n445  Paragraph 6  modifies section 6 of the 1996 Act where a landowner proposes to undertake any \nexcavation or erection near a building or structure which has been erected for Phase 2b \npurposes or which is on land held by the Secretary of State or the nominated undertaker for \nPhase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  purposes. This modification allows the Secretary of State or \nthe nominated undertaker to decide that works for the protection of the building or structure \nshould be carried out by the Secretary of State or the nominated undertaker at the expense of \nthe landowner, instead of by the landowner.  \n446  Paragraph 7  provides a new procedure for the resolution of disputes which relate to works \nrequired for Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  purposes, or to a building or structure on land \nheld by the Secretary of State or the nominated undertaker for Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  \npurposes, rather than the procedure provided by section 10 of the 1996 Act. The disputes are \nto be determined by a single arbitrator appointed, if no agreement can be reached, by the \nPresident of the Institution of Civil Engineers.   \n447  Paragraph 8  modifies sections 13 and 14 of the 1996 Act regarding works carried out by an \nadjoining owner, if that work is given notice under section 6(5) of that Act.  \nClause  30: Street Works  \n448  Clause  30 introduces Schedule 24  which disapplies various controls relating to works in or near \nstreets and highways.  \nSchedule 24: Street Works  \n449  Schedule 24 disapplies a number of provisions of highways legislation which relate to works \naffecting highways and streets, where they intersect with Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  \nworks. The disapplications do not apply to highways and streets for which the Secretary of State or a strategic highways company is the highway or the street authority, unless the \nSecretary of State or the strategic highways company consents. In the case of each of the \n51 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

These refer to street \nauthorities’ ability to ask for apparatus placed in a street to be moved if the street is later \ndesignated a protected street and direct the nominated undertaker regarding ongoing works if \na street is either designated or removed as protected.   \n456  Paragraph 2(7)  disapplies section 63(1) of the 1991 Act which provides that a street with special \nengineering difficulties cannot be worked on until plans and sections of works are agreed \nbetween the nominated undertaker and street authority.  \n457  Sub-paragraphs (8)  and (10) disapply sections 73A(1) and 78A(1)(b) of that Act. These relate to \nthe requirement to re- surface streets after carrying out street works. These sections have been \ndisapplied as these works are addressed by provision in Part I of Schedule 32 to the Bill.   \n458  Paragraph 2(9)  disapplies section 74A of the 1991 Act and regulations made under that section \nwhich allow a highway authority to make charges for occupying highways to carry out street \nworks.   \n459  Sub-paragraphs (11)  to (15) disapply the restrictions which apply under Schedule 3A to the \n1991 Act where a street authority receives notice that substantial street works are proposed in \na highway. These paragraphs remove the right of the street authority to require notification of \nother street works in such a highway and to give directions as to when street works may \ncommence, and also remove restrictions on the construction of further street works during or \nafter the completion of street works.  \n460  Under Paragraph 2(16) these provisions only apply to a street for which the Secretary of State \n52 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

This consent may be subject to conditions.   \nPermit schemes  \n461  Paragraph 3  includes provisions that make clear that nothing in Part 3 of the Traffic \nManagement Act 2004, and nothing in any scheme or regulation made under that Part, applies \nto works authorised by the Bill. This is because these provisions would require further \nconsent for works which have already been authorised by the Bill and are necessary for the \nimplementation of Phase 2b (Crewe – Manchester) of High Speed 2.  \n462  Under Paragraph 3(2) , this disapplication does not apply to streets for which the Secretary of \nState or a strategic highways company is the highway authority unless the Secretary of State \nor the strategic highways company consents. Consent may be subject to conditions.  \nClause  31: Lorries  \n463  Clause  31 introduces Schedule 25, which contains provisions relating to the use of heavy \ncommercial vehicles.  \nSchedule 25: Lorries  \n464  Schedule 25 modifies the application of lorry ban orders (as defined in the Schedule ) in respect \nof works for Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  of HS2. The provisions of the Schedule  apply to an \norder made at any time under section 1, 9 , or 14 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 which \nimposes restrictions on the use of roads by heavy commercial vehicles.  \nLorry ban orders  \n465  Paragraph 1  defines the orders to which Schedule 25 applies. Paragraph 1  only applies to lorry \nban orders made by the Secretary of State or a strategic highways company if the Secretary of \nState or strategic highways company consents. Consent may be subject to conditions.  \nRequired provision in lorry ban orders  \n466  Paragraph 2  sets out a provision that is to be treated as included in any  orders made under \nParagraph 1 . \nIssue of emergency permits  \n467  Paragraphs 3  and 4 make provision for the grant of emergency permits under lorry ban orders \nin cases where a permit is required for a journey to be undertaken within eight working days \nof the application including provision to enable applications to be made at any time by \ntelephone or by electronic means.  \nGrant of applications for permit  \n468  Given  that the routing  of heavy  commercial  vehicles  is intended  to be one of the areas  of \ncontrol  that planning  authorities will have  under  the planning  regime established  under  the \nBill, paragraph 5  applies where an application for the issue of a permit is made under P aragraph \n3, or is otherwise connected to authorised works. It restricts the right to refuse or condition a \npermit under a lorry ban order.  \n469  Under Paragraph 5(4) , an applicant who disagrees with a decision of the authority not to grant \na permit or to grant it subject to conditions may appeal the decision within 28 days.

For those which refer to another Act, please see the definition in the \nrelevant piece of legislation.  \nClause  32: Noise  \n471  Clause  32 introduces Schedule 26 , which contains provisions regarding noise on construction \nsites or which constitutes a statutory nuisance.   \nSchedule 26: Noise  \nControl of noise on construction sites  \n472  Paragraph 1(1)  modifies the operation of sections 60 and 61 of the Control of Pollution Act \n1974, so that appeals under those provisions are determined by the Secretary of State or, if the \nparties agree, by arbitration, rather than by a magistrates’ court.   \n473  Paragraph 1(2)  enables the Secretary of State for Transport and the Secretary of State for the \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs, acting jointly, to make regulations about procedure in \nrelation to such arbitrations.  \n474  Under Paragraph 1(3) , the regulations are to be made by statutory instrument subject to the \nnegative resolution procedure.    \nDefences to proceedings relating to statutory nuisance  \n475  Paragraph 2  provides a defence to proceedings for failure to comply with an abatement notice \nunder section 80 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, where the subject of the abatement \nnotice concerns noise caused by the construction, maintenance or use of the works authorised \nby the Bill or the operation of Phase 2b (Crewe – Manchester), and the noise cannot \nreasonably be avoided.  \n476  Paragraph 3  provides that an order under section 82(2) of the Environmental Protection Act \n1990 may not be made for noise emitted from premises, or from a vehicle, machinery and \nequipment in a street, where the noise is a consequence of the construction, maintenance, use \nor the operation of Phase 2b (Crewe –  Manchester).  \n477  Paragraphs 3  and 4 provide that an order under section 82(2) of the Environmental Protection \nAct 1990 may not be made by a magistrates' court in connection with noise emitted from \npremises, or from a vehicle, machinery and equipment in a street, where the nominated \nundertaker can show that the premises, or the vehicle, machinery or equipment, are or is \nbeing used  in connection with the carrying out of works authorised by the Bill, is a \nconsequence of the construction, maintenance or use of the works authorised by the Bill or the \noperation of  Phase 2b and the works concerned are being carried out in accordance with a \nnotice or consent issued by the local authority under section 60, 61 or 65 of the Control of \nPollution Act 1974 or the noise cannot reasonably be avoided. These provisions of the 1974 \nAct address control of noise on construction sites (section 60), consent for work on \nconstruction sites (section 61) and consent to exceed noise limits (section 65) . \nClause  33: Local Acts  \n54 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 478  Clause  33 introduces Schedule 27, which disapplies elements of certain local acts in Cheshire \nand Greater Manchester. Those elements will not apply in relation to premises or vehicles \nauthorised by the Bill.   \nSchedule 27: Local Acts  \n479  Schedule 2  sets out particular elements of local acts in Cheshire and Manchester which will not \napply to the works authori sed by this Bill.  \n480  Paragraph 1  disapplies Section 12 of the Cheshire County Council Act 1968, which prohibits \nthe parking of heavy goods vehicles.  \n481  Paragraph 2 disapplies aspects of the  Cheshire County Council Act 1980, in relation to plans \nfor new streets , the storage of flammable material , building plans and prescriptions of signs.  \n482  Paragraph 3  disapplies aspects of the Greater Manchester Act 1981, in relation to parking of \ngoods vehicles in residential streets, control of verges, dust, powers of entry for prevention of \ndamage by pests, building plans, and the storage of flammable material.  \nClause  34: Community Infrastructure Levy  \n483  Clause  34 provides that liability to the Community Infrastructure levy under Part 11 of the \nPlanning Act 2008 or under regulations made under section 54 of the Planning (Scotland) Act 2019 does not apply or arise in relation to any development authorised by this Bill.  \nPart 7: Railway Matters  \nClause  35: Objectives of Office of Rail and Road  \n484  The Railways Act 1993 imposes on the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) a duty to address certain \nobjectives in the execution of its non- safety functions. These objectives do not currently \ncontain any explicit requirement for the ORR to facilitate the construction of Phase 2b (Crewe \n– Manchester) of High Speed 2.  \n485  Clause  35 Subsection (1)  adds such a requirement and thereby clarifies the ORR’s role for the \nbenefit of the ORR and rail operators.  \n486  Subsection (2)  instructs the ORR to consult the Secretary of State about how it should carry out \nthis duty. The duty will sit alongside the ORR’s existing duties and is not intended to override \nits existing duties.  \n487  Subsection s (3) and (4) enable the Secretary of State to make an order by statutory instrument  \nrepealing this Clause . This power enables the objective to be removed from the remit of the \nORR when it is no longer relevant.  \nClause  36: Disapplication of licensing requirement in pre -operational phase   \n488  Subsection (1)  provides that section 6(1) of the Railways Act 1993 does not apply to a network \nconstructed under this Bill, or any trains running on such a network, if it is not ready for \ncommercial use. This allows for operational testing in the pre -commercial phase.  \n489  Under Subsection (2) , a network will be deemed ready for commercial use if the Secretary of \nState lays a notice before Parliament to that effect.  \n490  Subsection (3)  provides that such an exemption under this Clause  is an appropriate licence \nexemption for the purposes of section 122 of the Railways Act 1993. This means that a defence is available in the case of any proceedings for nuisance.  \n55 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 491  Subsection (4)  defines terms used in the Clause .  \nClause  37: Disapplication of statutory closure provisions  \n492  Subsection (1)  provides that the Secretary of State may at any time before a railway authorised \nby the Bill is ready for commercial use  disapply the closure provisions of the Railways Act \n2005 in the case of closures which are necessary or expedient because of the construction or \noperation of that railway . The disapplied closure provisions set out what must be done, in \nterms of notice, consultation and provision of information, in the event of a proposal to close \nexisting services, stations or parts of the rail network.  \n493  Subsection (2) defines statutory closure provisions.  \n494  Under Subsection  (3), a railway is only ready for commercial use if the Secretary of State has \nnotified Parliament that this is the case.  \nClause  38: Other railway legislation etc.  \n495  Clause  38 introduces Schedule 28, which provides for the ways in which other railway \nlegislation applies to Phase 2b (Crewe – Manchester) of High Speed 2.   \nSchedule 28 : Application of other railway legislation etc.  \n496  Schedule 28 contains a number of provisions which relate to how other legislation pertaining to \nrailways applies to Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester) .  \nHighway (Railway Crossings) Act 1839  \n497  Paragraph 1  disapplies the Highway (Railway Crossings) Act 1839, concerning the gating of \ncarriageways crossed on the level. This is because it is not proposed that level crossings for carriageways will be provided under the Bill.  \nRailway Regulation Act 1840  \n498  Paragraph 2  modifies section 16 of the Railway Regulation Act 1840 as it relates to Phase 2b \n(Crewe – Manchester) or trains that travel wholly or partly on Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester) , \nby increasing the maximum penalty for offences relating to obstruction and trespass to a fine \non summary conviction at level 3 on the standard scale or imprisonment for 51 weeks (in \nEngland and Wales) or 12 months (in Scotland).  \n499  By virtue of P aragraph 2(2)  however, the maximum term of imprisonment in England and \nWales is to be read as one month for offences committed before section 281(5) of the Criminal \nJustice Act 2003 is brought into force.  \nRailway Regulation Act 1842  \n500  Paragraph 3  disapplies section 9 of the Railway Regulation Act 1842, concerning the gating of \ncarriageways crossed on the level, for the same reason that paragraph 1 disapplies the \nHighway (Railway Crossings) Act 1839  \nRailway Clause s Consolidation Act 1845  \n501  Paragraph 4 incorporates the specified sections of the Railways Clause s Consolidation Act 1845 \ninto this Bill.  \nRegulation of Railways Act 1889  \n502  Paragraph 5  modifies section 5 of the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 as it relates to Phase 2b \n56 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

This does not allow the Secretary \nof State to set the terms of any agreement, but protects against the arbitration process \ndelivering an outcome that hampers the delivery or operation of Phase 2b (Crewe – \nManchester) of High Speed 2.  \n513  Paragraph 1(5)  provides that the Secretary of State may be asked by either party, or the \narbitrator, to provide a direction, but does not have to be asked to do so. Paragraph 1(4)  states \nthat a direction may be provided even if the Secretary of State is directly or indirectly a party \nto the arbitration.  \n514  Paragraph 1(6)  considers the circumstances in which the arbitrator must comply with the \n57 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

The arbitrator must do so if the direction is both relevant to the determination \nof the terms of the agreement and is given before the arbitrator has reached a decision. \n515  Paragraph 1(7)  sets out what the arbitrator must do in complying with a direction. Broadly, the \narbitrator must try to ensure that the agreement reached through arbitration achieves the outcome set out by the direction from the Secretary of State, as far as is reasonably possible.  \nDirections as to consolidation and grouping of proceedings  \n516  Paragraph 2  sets out the ways in which the proceedings for arbitration are to be conducted.  \n517  Paragraph s 2(1) and 2(2) provide that the Secretary of State will have the power to request, or \nto direct, that a group of proceedings, for example on a similar matter, should be included in \nthe same arbitration process, or should be arbitrated at the same time.  \n518  Paragraph 2(3)  provides that the arbitrator may make a request for such direction, while \nparagraph 2(4)  sets out that such a direction must establish the terms for consolidating or \ntiming hearings.  \n519  Paragraph 2(5)  contains provisions for cases where hearings with different arbitrators are \nconsolidated. These allow the direction for such hearings to both specify the person who will \nbe the arbitrator and how that person shall be determined.  \n520  Paragraph 2(6) defines the terms used in Schedule 29.  \nClause  40: Transfer  of functions relating to works  \n521  Subsections (1)  to (4) provide that the Secretary of State may by order transfer the authority to \ncarry out works on railway land where the land is also being transferred. This Clause  is \nincluded in the Bill because, during the construction of Phase 2b  (Crewe – Manchester)  of \nHigh Speed 2, works may be required on or close to other railways where unrelated work, \napproved under other legislation, is also due to be carried out and will still be necessary.  \n522  Subsections (5) and (6) define terms used in the Clause .  \nPart 8: Traffic  \nClause  41: Traffic  \n523  Clause  41 introduces Schedule 30, which contains provisions relating to traffic regulation.  \nSchedule 30 : Traffic regulation  \nTraffic authority to consult Secretary of State before making traffic regulation order \n524  Paragraph 1  requires a traffic authority to consult the Secretary of State before making an order \nunder section 1,9 or 14 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (a “TRO”) which could affect the construction of the works authorised by the Bill.  \n525  The consultation requirement set out in P aragraph 1(2)  applies where the order relates to a \nroad which is within the Bill limits or is, or may become, part of a construction traffic route for the authorised works, and the authority considers that the provisions of the traffic order could \nsignificantly interfere with the use of the road for the construction of the authorised works by \nheavy commercial vehicles.  \n526  Paragraphs 1(3)  sets out the definitions of certain terms used within Schedule 30.  \n58 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n 527  Paragraph 2  enables the Secretary of State to designate a road or a part of a road to which the \nconsultation requirement in  Paragraph 1(2)  does not, until further notice, apply because the \nroad is not being used for the construction of the authorised works. The Secretary of State can \nalso designate types of TRO in relation to which the consultation requirement is not to apply.  \n528  Paragraph 3  provides that the consultation requirement under P aragraph 1(2)  will cease to \napply in relation to the whole or part of the area of a traffic authority if the Secretary of State gives notice to the authority that no further works under the Bill are to be constructed in that area or part, and that the use of relevant roads in that area or part are no longer required for \nthe construction of the Bill works.  \n529  Under Paragraph 3(3) , the Secretary of State must give notice in a timely manner  if they \nconsider this to be the case.  \nPower of Secretary of State to direct traffic authority to make traffic regulation order \n530  Paragraph 4  enables the Secretary of State to direct a traffic authority to make a TRO if it is \nnecessary for the purposes of the timely, efficient and cost -effective construction of the works \nauthorised by the Bill and is reasonable in the circumstances. In this case, the relevant traffic \nauthority may not make a further TRO varying or revoking that orders.  \n531  Paragraphs 5  and 6 contain supporting provisions where a traffic authority is required by \nparagraph 4 to make an order under section 1,4 or 9 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.  \nFurther powers of Secretary of State (including in relation to variation or revocation of orders)  \n532  Paragraph 7  enables the Secretary of State to direct a traffic authority to revoke or vary a TRO \nmade in pursuance of a direction under P aragraph 4 .  \n533  Paragraph 8  gives default power to the Secretary of State to make, revoke or vary a TRO where \na traffic authority has failed to comply with a direction under P aragraph 4  or 7 requiring the \ntraffic authority to do so.  \n534  Paragraph 9  enables the Secretary of State by means of a statutory instrument  to vary or revoke \na TRO made by a traffic authority if he considers that it is necessary for the purposes of the \ntimely, efficient and cost -effective construction of the works authorised by the Bill and is \nreasonable in the circumstances.  \n535  Paragraph 10 makes additional provisions relating to an order made by the Secretary of State \nunder paragraph 8  or 9. \nPower to restrict traffic authority from making or implementing traffic regulation order  \n536  Paragraph 11 enables the Secretary of State to direct a traffic authority not to make or bring \ninto operation a TRO if the Secretary of State considers that the TRO could significantly \ninterfere with the use of any road for the construction of the works authorised by the Bill.  \nConsultation requirements applicable to the Secretary of State  \n537  Paragraph 12(1) requires the Secretary of State to consult a traffic authority before giving a \ndirection under P aragraph s 4, 7 or 11 to make, vary or revoke a TRO, or not to make a TRO, or \nbring the TRO into force. The Secretary of State must also consult a traffic authority before \nmaking an order under P aragraph 8(2)  or 9 revoking or varying a TRO made by the authority.  \n538  Paragraph 12(2)  sets out the purposes of consultation , which are to ensure public safety and to \n59 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

This Schedule extends the planning permission available for \ncertain works of statutory undertakers, carried out in consequence of Phase 2b  (Crewe – \nManchester) , which have been environmentally assessed in connection with the Bill.  This \nenvironmental assessment , referred to in Clause 43 and Schedule 31 is carried out in the \ndevelopment and publication of the Environmental Statement.  \nSchedule 31 : Extension of planning permission for statutory undertakers  \nCase where planning permission extended  \n552  Paragraph 1  disapplies the provisions of article 3(10) of the Town and Country Planning \n(General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 to allow certain statutory \nundertakers (such as sewerage and electricity undertakers) to rely on their own permitted \ndevelopment rights where the likely significant effects of their works are covered by a Phase \n2b (Crewe –  Manchester) environmental assessment.  \nCondition of extended planning permission  \n553  Paragraph 2  contains provisions enabling the Secretary of State to impose requirements in \nrelation to the extended planning permission provided by this Schedule. This can be either to \nensure compliance with an undertaking given to the Select Committees of either House of \nParliament , or to ensure the environmental impacts of the development do not materially \ndiffer from those set out in the Environmental Statement.  \nControls on proposed development  \n554  Paragraphs 3  and 4 enable the Secretary of State to give notice disapplying the planning \npermission given by P aragraph 1  where it appears that proposed development is not covered \nby the Phase 2b (Crewe – Manchester) Environmental Statement, or in order to avoid the \nbreach of an undertaking given to the Select Committees of either House of Parliament.  \nNotices  \n555  Paragraph 5  specifies the content of a notice issued under Schedule 3 1.  \nClause  44: Protective Provisions  \n556  Clause  44 introduces Schedule 32, which protects the interest of certain persons affected by the \nBill.  \nSchedule 32 : Protective provisions  \n557  Schedule 32 contains provisions setting out the necessary protections for various bodies with \nstatutory responsibilities likely to be affected by the works.  \nPart 1 – Highways and Traffic  \n558  The provisions of Part 1 contain protection s for highway authorities (which are defined for the \n61 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

This applies to the \nnominated undertaker in relation to powers to stop up streets and to construct works.  \n564  Paragraphs 4  and 5 relate to works constructed under highways. Approval of plans by the \nhighway authori ty is required for the construction of tunnels, subways,  or other structures \nwithin eight metres of the surface (excluding street works  or road works  within the meaning \nof Part 3  and Part 4 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991). Consent  is required if the \ncompleted  structure  will interfere with  drainage  or will be within  two metres  of the surface.  \n565  Paragraph 6  applies to the construction of a new bridge, or an extension or alteration of an \nexisting bridge.  Before work begins, the highway authority must approve plans of the works \ntaking place.  A bridge must be constructed in such a way as to avoid water dripping onto a \nhighway and the highway authority may place lamps or other apparatus at the cost of the \nnominated undertaker to light any highway under the bridge.  \n566  Under  Paragraph 7,  the nominated undertaker must ensure that works under a highway are \ndesigned, constructed , and maintained to carry the appropriate loading for highway bridges. \nThe nominated undertaker must also indemnify the highway authority against expenses \nreasonably accrued in the maintenance or repair of works caused by non -compliance with the \nprovisions of Paragraph 7  by the nominated undertaker. \n567  Paragraph 8  allows a highway authority or its officers to inspect the construction of works \nwhich may affect the highways of the highway authority.  \n568  Paragraphs 9  to 15 contain miscellaneous provisions governing the way that works are \nconstructed in highways, together with provision for reinstating streets after completion of \nthe work, making good damage caused to highways and street furniture, and providing for \nreimbursement of costs incurred by highways authorities in connection with road diversions \nrequired for the works.  \n569  Paragraph 16  provides that the nominated undertaker will not be exempt from liability, under \nthis Part of this Schedule or otherwise, by the fact that an act or thing was done in accordance \nwith plans approved by the highway authority.  \n570  Paragraph 17 sets out  how to resolve disputes arising between the nominated undertaker and \nthe highway authority regarding matters under this Part. If both parties agree, or the dispute relates to the amount of compensation payab le, the matter should be referred to arbitration. \nOtherwise, the dispute must be determined by a person appointed by the Secretary of State, who must have regard to any such matters specified by the Secretary of State when the \nappointment is made.  In Scotland the appointment is to be made in consultation with the \nScottish Ministers.  \n62 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

This principle applies except in exceptional circumstances where a certificate is issued by the appropriate \nMinisters allowing this requirement to be dispensed with. The appropriate Ministers, in \nrelation to England,  are the Secretary for State for Transport acting jointly with either the \nSecretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , or the Secretary of State for \nBusiness, Energy and Industrial Strategy , and in relation to Scotland, the Secretary of State \nacting in consultation with the Scottish Ministers . \n577  Paragraphs 20 to 24 set out a procedure for dealing with diversion of apparatus (which can be \nrequired by either the nominated undertaker or the undertaker concerned) in consequence of \nthe Phase 2b (Crewe- Manchester) works. This requires the nominated undertaker or the \nSecretary of State to provide rights and facilities for the replacement apparatus when it  can do \nso, but otherwise the statutory undertaker is required to use its best efforts  to obtain these. \nThe terms relating to any such replacement apparatus are to be agreed or otherwise \ndetermined in accordance with the  disputes procedure under Paragraph 3 1, and any \nperson  making a determination  under  Paragraph 3 1 must have regard to any template \nprovisions issued by the appropriate Ministers (following consultation with the undertake rs). \nParagraph 20(3)  deals specifically with the position where replacement apparatus is to be \nconstructed in land which is temporarily occupied by the nominated undertaker and makes it \nclear that the statutory undertaker may enter onto the land and construct and bring into use \nthe replacement apparat us in advance of being granted permanent rights.  \n578   Paragraph 25 applies to apparatus which is not proposed to be removed by the nominated \nundertaker. Plans of the proposed works near to the apparatus  must be provided by the \nnominated undertaker which include any proposed protective measures. The statutory \nundertaker can require any reasonable protective measures to be undertaken, or require the  \nremoval  of the apparatus.  \n579  Paragraphs 26 and 27 protect access to apparatus for statutory undertakers. The statutory \nundertaker is entitled to enjoy  the same rights for the purpose of maintaining apparatus in \nstreets which have been permanently stopped up under the powers of the Act  as was the case \nbefore the Act came into force.  \n63 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

If the relocation works cost more than the cost of placing apparatus \nof the existing type or at the existing depth, the amount payable to the operator under \nsub-paragraph (1)  is to be reduced by that amount of excess. \n582  Under Paragraph 28(5),  an extension of apparatus is not to be counted as placing apparatus of \ngreater dimensions except where the apparatus provides a more than equivalent service. \nWhere a joint in a cable is necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or \nmanhole is to be treated as if it had been agreed originally.  \n583  Paragraph 28(6)  provides that if apparatus is substituted for apparatus placed more than seven \nand a half years earlier, any conferred financial benefit by replacing the apparatus should be \ndiscounted from the amount payable to an operator under sub -paragraph (1).  \n584  Paragraph 29 provides an indemnity in respect of damage to apparatus or interruption to the \nundertakers’ service, caused by the construction of the works. This indemnity includes \nprovision for reasonable compensation for any losses suffered by the undertaker. \n585  Paragraph 30 provides that, where Network Rail Infrastructure Limited (“Network Rail”) is the \nnominated undertaker, this Part of the Schedule  will apply,  subject to any existing agreements \nNetwork Rail may have with undertakers.   \n586  Paragraph 3 2 sets out how to resolve disputes arising between the nominated undertaker and a \nstatutory undertaker regarding matters under this Part. If both parties agree, or the dispute \nrelates to the amount of compensation payable, the matter should be referred to arbitration. \nOtherwise, the dispute must be determined by a person appointed by the appropriate \nMinisters, who must have regard to any such matters specified by the appropriate Ministers \nwhen the appointment is made.  The appropriate Ministers are, in relation to England,  the \nSecretary for State for Transport acting jointly with either the Secretary of State for \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs, or the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and \nIndustrial Strategy and , in relation to Scotland, the Secretary of State acting in consultation \nwith the Scottish Mini sters . \nPart 3 – Electronic Communications Code Networks  \n587  Under Paragraph 33(1),  the arrangements set out in this Part of the  Schedule  are to apply unless \nthe nominated undertaker and the operators concerned agree to vary them.  \n588  Paragraph 3 3(2) sets out the meaning of various terms used within this Part.  \n589  Paragraph 3 4(1) applies paragraph 23 of the electronic communications code for the purposes \nof the authorised works, subject to Paragraph 33(2).  \n590  Paragraph 34(2) disapplies Paragraphs 21 and 23 of the electronic communications code where: \nthe authorised works are regulated by the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, the \nnominated undertaker exercises powers under subsection (4)(b) of section 272 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (or the equivalent legislation in Scotland), or regarding any \nmatter regulated by P aragraph 36(3) to 36(8) of this Part.  \n591  Paragraph 35 provides that the temporary stopping up or diversion of highways does not \naffect the statutory rights of operators to use that street for the purpose of installing or \n64 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

This does not \naffect the rights of nominated undertaker or the operator to require removal of the apparatus \nunder this Part.  \n593  Paragraphs 3 6(3) and 36(4) require the nominated undertaker to give no less than 28 days’ \nnotice of its intention to stop up any highway under Paragraph 2  or 3 of Schedule 5. After \nservice of the notice, the operator, if it considers it is necessary, may remove the apparatus \nand place it or other apparatus in substitution in any position the operator has power to place \nit. \n594  Under Paragraph 3 6(5), the nominated undertaker must pay the operator reasonable costs \nincurred by the operator in connection with apparatus relocation works.  \n595  Paragraphs 36(6)  and 36(7)  apply where apparatus of a better type or greater dimensions is \nplaced or where apparatus placed at a greater depth than the existing apparatus in the course \nof works under sub -paragraph (4).  If the relocation works cost more than the cost of placing \napparatus of the existing type or at the existing depth, the amount payable to the operator \nunder sub-paragraph (5)  is to be reduced by that amount of excess. \n596  Under Paragraph 36(8),  an extension of apparatus is not to be counted as placing apparatus of \ngreater dimensions except where the apparatus provides a more than equivalent service. \nWhere a joint in a cable is necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or \nmanhole is to be treated as if it had been agreed originally.  \n597  Paragraph 36(9)  provides that if apparatus is substituted for apparatus placed more than seven \nand a half years earlier, any conferred financial benefit by replacing the apparatus should be \ndiscounted from the amount payable to an operator under sub -paragraph (5).  \n598  Paragraph 36(10)  disapplies Paragraphs 36(5) to  (9) where the authorised works constitute \nmajor transport or highway works under Part 3 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, \nor, in Scotland, Part 4 of that Act. Instead, allowable costs are to be determined in accordance \nwith section 85 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 or section 144, and the allowable \ncoasts are to be paid by the nominated undertaker and the operator in the proportions set out \nby regulations.  \n599  Paragraphs 37(1) and (2) provide that rights given by the Secretary of State or nominated \nundertaker to an operator to construct, maintain, repair, or inspect alternative apparatus must either have agree terms and conditions, or must be agreed in accordance with Paragraph 41. A \ndecision under Paragraph 41 must have regard to template provisions issued  by the \nappropriate  Ministers.  Such  a determination  must  consider  all reasonable  health and safety  \nrequirements  and have  regard to the operator’s  ability  to fulfil its service  obligations.  \n600  Paragraphs 37(3) and 37(4)  state that when determining the matters under sub -paragraph (2) , the \nappropriate Ministers must consult the operators on the form of the proposed template provisions. Any objections not resolved within six months of the date on which this Act comes \ninto force must be referred for independent adjudication. The independent adjudicator is to be \nappointed by the President of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.  \n601  Under Paragraph 37(5),  if the rights given by the nominated undertaker or the Secretary of \nState regarding alternative apparatus are more or less favourable to the operator than the \n65 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

This does not apply to apparatus governed by \nPart 3 or Part 4 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.   \n603  Paragraph 3 9 provides that, where Network Rail Infrastructure Limited is the nominated \nundertaker, this Part of the Schedule  will have effect subject to any existing agreements \nNetwork Rail may have with operators.   \n604  Paragraph 41 sets out how to resolve disputes arising between the nominated undertaker and a \nstatutory undertaker regarding matters under this Part. If both parties agree, or the dispute \nrelates to the amount of compensation payable, the matter should be referred to arbitration. \nOtherwise, the dispute must be determined by a person appointed by the appropriate \nMinisters, who must have regard to any such matters specified by the appropriate Ministers \nwhen the appointment is made. The cost of the dispute is to be allocated between the parties \nas directed by the appointed decision -maker.  \nPart 4 – Land drainage, flood defence, water resources and fisheries  \n605  These provisions contain protection for authorities (referred to as drainage authorities) which \nhave functions in connection with land drainage, flood defence, fisheries and water resources. \nThese bodies are, in England, the Environment Agency and the local drainage authorities (i.e. \nlocal authorities which are given drainage functions as lead local flood authorities as a result \nof the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 and internal drainage boards) and , in Scotland, \nthe Scottish Environment Protection Agency (“SEPA”). Under these provisions, protection is \ngiven to each drainage authority in relation to works affecting their functions.  \n606   In England , functions are divided between the Environment Agency and local drainage \nauthorities. Where works authorised by the Bill affect a main river, groundwater, water \nresources or fisheries, i.e. matters affecting the functions of the Environment Agency, the \nprotection applies to the Environment Agency. Where works affect ordinary watercourses (i.e. \nwatercourses which are not main rivers) or flood defence features for which a local drainage \nauthority is responsible, the protection applies to the relevant local drainage authority. In \nScotland , all functions are exercised by SEPA.  \n607  Paragraph 42(1) , provides that the arrangements set out in this Part of the  Schedule  are to \napply unless the nominated undertaker and the drainage authority concerned agree to vary \nthem.  It explains which type of drainage authority has responsibility in relation to the \ndifferent types of works and also provides, given the strategic role of the Environment \nAgency, for local drainage authorities to consult the Agency in exercising their functions and \nfor the Agency to be able to issue model conditions.  \n608  Paragraphs  43 and 45 provide for the drainage authority to approve plans of any specified \nworks and in approving plans to be able to make reasonable requirements (including \nrequiring the nominated undertaker to construct protective works at its own cost). Approval \nof plans under these provisions is not to be unreasonably withheld.   \n609  Paragraph  44 applies obligations under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2016 to the \ndrainage authority in England when exercising its functions under  Paragraph 4 3 to approve \nplans in relation to works affecting groundwater. These obligations relate to avoiding \npollution of groundwater.  Similar obligations under the Water Environment (Controlled \n66 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

It \nprovides  for these works to be constructed to the drainage authority’s reasonable satisfaction, \nfor the drainage authority to have the right to inspect the construction and to require \nalteration or removal of the works where they have not been constructed in accordance with \nthe requirements of this Part.  \n611  Under Paragraph 47,  the nominated undertaker must ensure that any drainage work within \nthe Act limits of deviation is kept in good order and free from obstruction. If any such \ndrainage work is not maintained to the satisfaction of the drainage authority, the drainage \nauthority may require the nominated undertaker to repair and restore the work. In the event \nthat the nominated undertaker does not take steps to rectify the work within 28 days’ of \nreceiving notice, the drainage authority may take necessary steps for compliance.  \n612  Paragraph  48 requires the nominated undertaker to make good any impairment to the \nefficiency of drainage works for flood defence purposes or any other damage. The drainage \nauthority can take remedial action where the nominated undertaker fails to do so.  \n613  Paragraph  49 requires the nominated undertaker to take all reasonably practicable measures to \nprevent interruption of the free passage of fish in any fishery and contains provision for the \nnominated undertaker to prevent or make good damage to fisheries (a fishery is defined as \nany waters containing fish and the fish within or migrating to or from such waters and the \nspawn, spawning grounds or food of such fish). The Environment Agency can take remedial \naction if the nominated undertaker fails to do so.   \n614  Paragraphs  50 to  52 contain a general indemnity for the drainage authority in respect of claims \nagainst it arising from the construction of the specified works in respect of the drainage \nauthority’s functions protected by this Part.   \n615  Paragraph 5 3 requires any dispute between the nominated undertaker and the drainage \nauthority to be referred to arbitration.  \nPart 5 – Canal & River Trust  \n616  Under Paragraph 54(1), the arrangements set out in this Part of the  Schedule  are to apply \nunless the nominated undertaker and the Canal & River Trust agree to vary them.  \n617  Paragraph 54(2) sets out the meaning of various terms used within this Part. The Trust is a \ncharitable trust which was established in July 2012 to replace the British Waterways Board, a \nstatutory corporation. It owns and  manages a network of waterways comprising canal and \nriver navigations, reservoirs, and docks. Several of its waterways may be affected by the \npowers of the Bill. These arrangements apply to “canals” which means any canal or waterway \nowned  or managed by the Trust, including towpaths and other land held or used for the \ncanal. The nominated undertaker’s works to which the provisions apply are any “specified \nworks” defined as works in, across, under or within 15 metres of, or which may affect, any \ncanal.   \n618  Under Paragraph 55,  the Secretary of State cannot compulsorily purchase land belonging to the \nCanal & River Trust, unless the land is necessary for the construction, maintenance, or \noperation of Phase 2b (Crewe –  Manchester) works.  \n619  Paragraph 56 requires the nominated undertaker to give plans of proposed work to the Canal \n& River Trust before any work can begin.

It \nprovides in particular for these to be constructed to the Canal & River Trust’s reasonable satisfaction and with minimum disruption to traffic on the canals and use of towpaths, for the \nTrust to have advance notice of commencement of construction, and the right to inspect the \nconstruction work.  \n621  Paragraphs 5 8 and 59 deal with deposits of materials on, in, or  over canals, and discharge of \nwater into canals. These operations will require the Trust’s consent (which is not to be \nunreasonably withheld). The exercise of the powers under Paragraph 10(5)  of Schedule 2  to \ndischarge water into watercourses is made subject to the terms of any consent given under \nthese provisions.   \n622  Under Paragraph 60, if  access along a towpath  is temporarily obstructed and there is no \nalternative means of access, the nominated undertaker is required (so far as is reasonably \npracticable) to provide a substitute. These requirements are in addition to the obligation \nin Paragraph 8(3)  or (6) of Schedule 5  to ensure reasonable pedestrian access to premises \nadjoining a highway which has been temporarily stopped up and to obtain the consent of the \nhighway authority for such closures.   \n623  Under Paragraph 61,  if canal work is abandoned , or is in such a condition that it does or may \nconstitute a danger or interference with navigation , the Canal & River Trust may require its \nremoval or carry out remedial  works  at the nominated  undertaker’s  expense, if the nominated  \nundertaker does  not take steps to repair the work.  \n624  Paragraph 62  contains a general indemnity for the Trust in respect of claims against it arising \nfrom damage to canals covered by the works and for the costs of making good such damage.   \n625  Paragraph 63  provides that no liability is to fall on the nominated undertaker for damage \nattributable to the action or inaction of the Canal & River Trust. However, work carried out by the nominated undertaker using plans agreed by the Canal & River Trust does not remove liability from the nominated undertaker in the absence of negligence on the part of the Canal \n& River Trust.  \n626  Paragraph 64  provides that any dispute arising between the nominated undertaker and the \nCanal & River Trust should be referred to arbitration if both parties agree or the dispute relates to the amount of compensation payable. Otherwise, the dispute must be determined by \na person appointed by the appropriate Ministers, who must have regard to any such matters \nspecified by the appropriate Ministers when the appointment is made. The reference to the \nappropriate Ministers is to the Secretary of State for Transport and the Secretary of State for \nEnvironment, Food and Rural affairs acting jointly.  \nPart 6 – For the Protection of the Manchester Ship Canal Company Limited  \n627  Paragraph 6 5(1) applies the arrangements set out in this Part of the  Schedule  unless otherwise \nagreed in writing between the nominated undertaker or the Secretary of State and the Manchester Ship Canal Company Limited  (MSCC) . \n628  Paragraph 65(2) defines the terms used in this Part.  \n629  Under Paragraph 66, the Secretary of State must not acquire any MSCC land or rights over \nsuch land, unless that land is reasonably necessary for the construction or operation of works \nauthorised by this Act.  \n68 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Within 14 days of receiving the plans, MSCC \nmay ask for reasonable further information about construction of the work if necessary for \nMSCC to give approval.  The nominated undertaker must only commence construction in \naccordance with the agreed plans or as determined under Paragraph 80.  \n632  Paragraph s 68(2)  states that MSCC must not unreasonably withh old approval. If approval has \nnot been granted  within 28 days of MSCC receiving the plans under Paragraph 68(1),  and \nMSCC has not indicated disapproval, then MSCC is deemed to have agreed to the work being \ncarried out as submitted.  \n633  Paragraph 68(3)  provides for  MSCC to specify conditions of any protective work or other \nrequirements to be carried out by the nominated undertaker or MSCC when giving approval. \nSuch protective work must be carried out without unnecessary delay. \n634  Paragraph 68(4)  provides that approval under Paragraph 68(3)  must not be unreasonably \nwithheld. If MSCC has not disapproved the protective work within 7 days of the protective \nwork being completed, then MSCC is deemed to have approved the protective work. \n635  Under Paragraph 68(5),  MSCC must give reasonable access to the nominated undertaker or its \nagents to protective works constructed by MSCC, and must give the nominated undertaker \nany information reasonably required about the protective works or their construction method.  \n636  Paragraph 69  states that the nominated undertaker must provide and maintai n any temporary \nlighting in the vicinity of any specified work as reasonably required by MSCC . \n637  Paragraph 70(1)  sets out a number of conditions for the construction of specified work.

Where an unauthorised deposit has occurred, the \nnominated undertaker must take reasonable steps to make good any breach of obligation.  \n642  Paragraph 71(4)  sets out conditions that might be impose by MSCC under Paragraph 71, \nincluding conditions requiring the reimbursement of expenses which MSCC would not have \notherwise incurred but for the discharge and additional dredging costs.  \n69 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

MSCC must give notice to the nominated undertaker of \nthe intention to construct such works and the nominated undertaker may make \nrepresentations to MSCC. The cost of such alterations and additions is to be incurred by the \nnominated undertaker. \n646   Paragraph 74(1)  makes provision that on completion of the construction of the specified \nworks all temporary works in, on or over the Canal must be removed.  \n647   Paragraph 74(2)  provides that the removal of temporary works must be undertaken so as to \ncause as little detriment as possible to the Canal and as little interference as possible to the safe passage of vessels along the Canal.  \n648   Paragraph 74(3)  provides for the making good of any damage by the nominated undertaker \nand the payment of compensation to MSCC arising from detriment to the Canal or interference with any vessels on the Canal that is caused by the failure to remove temporary \nworks.  \n649   Paragraph 74(4)  provides that MSCC may remove temporary works in the event of any failure \nby the nominated undertaker to remove those works within a reasonable period after being \ngiven notice by MSCC to remove temporary works that have not been removed in accordance \nwith sub-paragraph (1).  \n650   Paragraph 75 provides that MSCC, following completion of the construction of a specified \nwork, may give notice to the nominated undertaker of the state of maintenance of the work not being a work vested in MSCC, which is causing or likely to cause detriment and which \nrequires the nominated undertaker to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put \nthe specified work in such a state of repair that does not give rise to such detriment.  \n651   Paragraph 76  makes provision for the recovery of costs by MSCC arising in connection with \nthe construction of protective works and bringing the construction of specified works or \nprotective works to the attention of canal users.  \n652   Paragraph 77  provides that in the event of any detriment to the Canal being caused by, or as a \nresult of the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work, the nominated \nundertaker (or MSCC at the nominated undertaker’s expense) must make good such \ndetriment and pay the reasonable expenses to which MSCC is put together with reasonable \ncompensation for any losses sustained by MSCC in making good or otherwise by reason of \nany such detriment.  \n653   Paragraph 78 provides for MSCC to be indemnified from claims, damages and demands \nwhich may be made against, or recovered from MSCC arising from the construction of any \nspecified work or protective work or any act or omission of the nominated undertaker \nincluding any contractor, agent or employee engaged on the works and extends to costs \nreasonably incurred in making good such detriment.

This is \nland held by the Crown as bona vacantia (broadly , land which is held by the Crown in \ndefault, in the absence of any other owner of the land).  \n698  Subsection ( 4) define s ‘Crown land’.  \n699  Subsection (5)  defines the land in relation to which deemed consent is given under subsection \n(3). \n700  Subsection ( 6) indicates who the ‘Crown authority’ is for the purposes of granting consent to \nthe nominated undertaker. This will, in practice, be a Government department, the Crown \nEstate Commissioners or the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster  or a person appointed by \nthe Duke of Cornwall , dependent on the land in question.   \n701  Subsection ( 7) provides that, if there is a question about which body is the ‘Crown authority’, \nthe matter is to be decided by the Treasury.  \n702  Subsection (8)  provides that , where deemed consent is given under S ubsection (3), this does not \nconstitute taking possession of the land, or a waiver of the Crown’s right to disclaim \nownership of the land or notice to Crown that the land may be vested in the Crown ( i.e. \nanything which would prejudice the Crown’s right to disclaim an interest in the land).  \n703  Subsection (9) makes clear that nothing in this section is to affect the exercise of the power in this Bill in relation to land which becomes  subject to escheat. Accordingly, no consent from a \nCrown authority is required in relation to the use of such land . \n704  Subsections ( 10) and (11) apply the same provision s relating to  deemed consent  and in relation \nto land that becomes subject to escheat,  to the High Speed Rail (London –  West Midlands) Act \n2017 and the High Speed Rail (West Midlands –  Crewe) Act 2021.  \n74 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

Clause  53 contains provisions similar  to those in the High Speed Rail (London \n– West Midlands) Act 2017 and the High Speed Rail (West Midlands -  Crewe) Act 2021, \nremoving the restrictions on disposal of land held by the Commissioners which they consider \nmay be required for Phase 2b purposes.  \nPart 14: Deposited Plans and Sections  \nClause  54: “Deposited plans” and “deposited sections”  \n708  Clause  54 defines the meaning of “deposited plans” and “deposited sections” for the purposes \nof the Bill.   \nClause  55: Correction of deposited plans  \n709  Clause  55 contains provisions for correcting the plans or book of reference to the plans which \nhave been deposited in Parliament with this Bill, should this be required. These provisions are \nnormal for hybrid Bills.  \n710  Under Subsection (1) , corrections may be made if the plans are incorrect in describing the land \nto be taken, or its ownership or occupation. In these cases, the Secretary of State can apply to \nhave these corrected by two justices who have jurisdiction over the land. This can be done \nafter giving 10 days’ notice to the owners or occupiers of the land.  \n711  Subsections (2)  to (5) provide for the justices to certify that such an error in the plans was made \nby a mistake or inadvertence, and, in such a certificate, state in what respect the plans or book \nof reference are incorrect. The certificate must then be deposited in Parliament and with each \nlocal authority in whose area any of the land concerned is situated. Once this has occurred, \nthe plans or book of reference are to be treated as corrected, and the Secretary of State may act \nas though the deposited plans had always been as corrected.  \n712  Subsection (6)  provides that, if the land in question is situated in two judicial areas, a justice of \nthe peace with jurisdiction in one of the areas may act with regard to land in either area.  \n713  Subsection (7)  defines “local authority”.  \n Clause  56: Obstruction of construction of works  \n714  Clause  56, Subsection (1)  provides that a person commits an offence, if without reasonable \nexcuse, the person (a) obstructs a relevant undertaker or person acting under the undertaker’s \nauthority in setting out the lines of the relevant works, constructing any relevant works, or \ntaking any steps reasonably necessary for the purposes of facilitating, or in connection with \nthe construction of relevant works, or (b) interferes with, moves  or removes any apparatus \nwhich relates to the construction of any relevant works and belongs to a person specified in \n75 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

The \nProposed Scheme received a CDEL settlement of £1,146m (2019 prices) up to 2024/25 and \nRDEL for one year of £133m for 2021/22. This reflects the ongoing development of the \nProposed Scheme, enabling design refinement and cost estimates to be developed ahead of \nsetting a Funding Envelope. The project will  initially be funded through RDEL  up to  the point \nof second reading of the bill, which will trigger the capitalisation point of the project where \nCDEL will be utilised for spending from this point.    \n792  At Spending Review 2021 an additional £29m (2019 prices) of RDEL funding for 2022 -23 was \nallocated to enable the passage of the bill through Parliament.   \nParliamentary approval for financial costs or for \ncharges imposed  \n793  A money resolution is required for the Bill, to cover potential expenditure by the Secretary of \nState for Transport under various provisions of the Bill. A number of provisions contemplate \nthe payment of compensation where the Secretary of State’s powers of compulsory acquisition \nare exercised. The Bill also confers a range of functions on the nominated undertaker \n(including the power to construct and maintain the main works for the construction of Phase \n2b of HS2, and other miscellaneous obligations to pay compensation).  Since the Secretary of \nState is the nominated undertaker until someone else is appointed, the exercise of such functions may involve expenditure by the Secretary of State. This Bill was previously \nintroduced to Parliament on 24 January 2022 and was considered by the Standing Orders \nCommittees of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Bill was carried over  \nand reintroduced  into the next Parliamentary session on 1 1 May 2022 and then again on 8 \nNovember 2023 . The Bill was re -introduced to Parliament on 25 July 2024.  \n794  The Bill also gives rise to additional functions for the Office of Rail and Road (previously the \nOffice of Rail Regulation). The Office was established by section 15 of the Railways and \nTransport Safety Act 2003. Paragraph 15 of Schedule 1 to that Act provides for expenditure incurred by the Office in connection with the performance of its functions to be paid out of \nmoney provided by Parliament, to the extent that the Office’s expenditure is not met by its \nother income. The exercise of the additional functions conferred on the Office by the Bill may \nlead to an increase in the Office’s expenditure and, as a result, an increase in the payments to \nthe Office out of money provided by Parliament under the 2003 Act.  \nCompatibility with the European Convention on \nHuman Rights  \n795  Section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1988 requires the Minister in charge of a Bill in either \n82 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6). This is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, \ndetails on the cover in the table of corrections ( published 2 August 2024).  \n House of Parliament to make a statement, before S econd Reading, about the compatibility of \nthe provisions of the Bill with the Convention rights (as defined by section 1 of the Act). The  \nSecretary of State has made the following statement: “In my view, the provisions of the High \nSpeed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill are compatible with the Convention rights.”  \n796  The High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill provides powers for the Secretary of State to \npurchase property compulsorily, and for a nominated undertaker to construct and operate a \nnew high speed railway between the Crewe and Manchester (Phase 2b of an intended high speed network called “HS2”).  \n797  As a hybrid bill, the Bill necessarily involves interference with property rights and homes. The \npotential for such effects engages, in particular, Article 1 of Protocol 1 (the right to peaceful \nenjoyment of possessions), Article 8 (the right to respect for private and family life) and, to the \nextent that any places of assembly or places used for religious purposes are affected, Article 9 \n(the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion). I n particular, the Bill contains \nprovisions for compulsory acquisition of land for building the new railway, and rights of \nentry to carry out surveys and works on people’s land. Furthermore, the railway would, by \ncausing noise, vibration, light pollution and visual intrusion, unavoidably reduce the \nenjoyment which owners of neighbouring land have over their property.  \n798  Mitigation of the impact of such interference is provided by the compensation provisions \nrelating to compulsory acquisition and injurious affection to properties under existing \nlegislation, which are applied to the Crewe –  Manchester section of HS2  by the Bill and by \nadditional compensation provisions in the Bill and also by a range of policies relating to \nhardship, land acquisition, business relocation and to mitigate construction impacts of the \nscheme. Taking into account the public and other benefits that will arise from development, \nand mitigation by the arrangements that have been provided, the Secretary of State is of the \nview that the Bill strikes a fair balance between the private interests of owners of property on \nor near the route, and the wider public interest in generating additional capacity on, and \nimproved connectivity through, the national rail network. Furthermore, he considers that any \nremaining interference with property and other rights is proportionate and can be and in the \ncircumstances is, justified.  \n799  The Bill contains provisions that provide for the determination of disputes by arbitration. In \nthe light of the applicability of standard procedures for arbitration and the availability of \njudicial review in relation to any decisions of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State is of \nthe view that the Bill is compliant with the requirement of Article 6 (the right to a fair trial).  \n800  The Bill contains a provision which makes it an offence, without reasonable excuse, to obstruct \nthe construction of the works comprising, or any acts which facilitate the works, or interfere \nwith any apparatus used in the works. The penalty on conviction is a level 3 fine. The \nSecretary of State is of the view that, as this offence will not in any way prevent or impede \npeaceful , non- obstructive  protests against the works, that the Bill is also compliant with article \n10 (freedom of expression) and article 11 (freedom of assembly and association).  \nEnvironment Act 2021  \n801  The Secretary of State has made a statement under sections 20(2)(a) and (3) of the \nEnvironment Act 2021 . This states that the Bill contains provision which, if enacted, would be \nenvironmental law, and that the Bill will not have the effect of reducing the level of \nenvironmental protection provided for by any existing environmental law.  \n83 \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill  as introduced to the House of \nCommons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6).

For example, provisions relating to the treatment of street works, the stopping \nup of highways, the making of rules concerning arbitration of disputes and directions \nregarding the giving of planning permission, would ordinarily be dealt with by Scottish \nMinisters where the issue arises in Scotland.  \n804  Under the Bill, the Secretary of State will make the necessary determinations under the above \nand other similar powers, in consultation with Scottish Ministers. Where the legislative or \nexecutive competence of Scottish Ministers is engaged and a legislative consent motion is \nrequired, these are set out in the table above.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is an updated version of the Explanatory Notes containing revised text, details on the cover in the \ntable of corrections (Published 2 August 2024).  \nBill 6–EN (Corrected)  59/1  \n HIGH SPEED RAIL \n(CREWE- MANCHESTER) BILL    \nEXPLANATORY NOTES \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the High Speed Rail (Crewe- Manchester) Bill Introduced in House \nof Commons  on 25 July 2024 (Bill 6 ).

We recognise the issues faced by GRT \nchildren and young people – and how education can make a positive difference.  \n \nAs mentioned during the debate, my department’s  GRT stakeholder group continues \nto inform the department’s thinking, policy and delivery so that GRT children and \nyoung people can fully reap the benefits of our Opportunity Mission reforms, and the \nbarriers they face are addressed.  \n \nOut of school learning was discussed at the 12th July GRT stakeholder group \nmeeting and group members were invited to submit any related questions or \nconcerns they had on this subject to the secretariat to be passed onto relevant \nteams for consideration and a response.  \n \nEngaging with the D epartment for Education  to ensure wider policies contribute to \nimproving attainment for GRT children and young people is a key area of interest for \nthe group and ensuring the best possible education for the many GRT who do not \nattend school can lead to better outcomes across the se communities.  \n \nOn your question about support for Open Doors Education and Training’s distance \nlearning scheme, this scheme was previously funded by the Department for Levelling \nUp, Housing and Communities  (DLUHC)  (now the Ministry of Housing, Communities \nand Local Government). As part of a wider package of post -pandemic support, in \n2021/22 DLUHC partnered with Bradford, Central Bedfordshire, Essex, Hillingdon, \nand Surrey local authorities and Open Doors Education and Training organisation to \ndeliver the £1.4m programme . This programme provided a wide range of targeted \nsupport for pre -school children, pupils in primary school and those transitioning to \nsecondary school thereby reducing drop -out rates, supporting young people not in \neducation, employment or training.  \nThis programme also helped adults needing literacy support and improved teachers’ \ncultural understanding and knowledge of GRT communities.  \n \nOver 600 GRT children and young people, 150 schools, over 100 staff members and \nlocal authorities were supported and reached during the lifespan of the programme. \nIt is now a matter for the local authorities to determine how they will mainstream the \nlesson s learnt, provide sustainable support to the GRT community in their areas and \nshare knowledge with other local authorities.  \n \nWhile the Department for Education currently has no plans to enter a new funding \npartnership with Open Doors Education and Training, we are committed to ensuring \nthat all children and young people have access to a high standard of education and \nresources t o support this. The Department funds Oak National Academy which gives \nchildren and families access to free and adaptable high -quality digital curriculum \nresources to support improved pupil outcomes and a remote education contingency.  \n \nParents and pupils are free to use Oak's resources outside of the classroom. The \nlevel of supervision needed has been designed to be minimal (dependant on the \nindividual child), and each lesson will have a pre -recorded video that guides children \nand parent s through each section step -by-step, making it a useful resource for all \nhome educated children including those in the GRT community.  \n \nAs I mentioned in the debate, the government has committed to introducing a duty \non local authorities to support home educating children (should their parents request \nit) as part of the Children Not in School proposals to be introduced in the future \nChildr en’s Wellbeing Bill. Where currently no such duty exists, this will ensure that \nmore children benefit from support and advice to promote their education.  \n \nThank you for raising this matter; and I look forward to continuing to discuss how the \ngovernment’s Children Not in School proposals can benefit the GRT community \nfollowing introduction of the Children’s Wellbeing Bill. A copy of this letter will be \ndeposi ted in the House Library.  \n \n \nYours sincerely,  \n \nThe Rt Hon Baroness Jacqui Smith  \nMinister for Skills",

This report sets out the Committee’s observations in relation to a private \nmember’s Bill. It has long been, and remains, the Committee’s approach to \napply the same exacting standards of scrutiny to all bills, whether a government \nbill or a private member’s bill. We acknowledge however that those members \nof the House who sponsor private members’ bills, unlike ministers, do not \nhave the support of departmental officials and Parliamentary Counsel in \nthe preparation of their bills. Our comments on private members’ bills are \nframed in the light of that understanding.\n LITHIUM-ION BATTERY SAFETY BILL [HL]\n2. This private member’s Bill is intended to make provision for the safe storage, \nuse and disposal of lithium-ion batteries. It is due to have its second reading \non 6 September. There is no delegated powers memorandum as the Bill has \nnot been produced with the help of the Government.\n3. The Bill contains five regulation making powers each of which would appear \nto allow for the creation of criminal offences:\n• Two of the regulation making powers are explicit in conferring powers \nto create offences. In those cases, there is also a power to provide for \nthe imposition of civil sanctions (clauses 3 and 4).\n• In one case the power to create an offence appears to be a necessary \nconsequence of the power being conferred (clause 2).\n• In the other two cases, the nature of the regulation making power \nrequires an enforcement mechanism, but without making it explicit \nwhat the nature of the enforcement mechanism is. Such a mechanism \nwould have to be the creation of offences or the imposition of civil \nsanctions (clauses 5 and 6).\n4. All of the powers in the Bill are subject to the negative resolution procedure. \nIn our guidance to Departments1, we make it clear that the use of subordinate \nlegislation to create criminal offences should be treated as exceptional and \nthat it should only be done where there is a compelling justification. We \nalso consider that, where subordinate legislation is used to create criminal \noffences (or where it is used to impose civil sanctions), it should be subject to \nthe affirmative resolution procedure.\n5. In the circumstances, we consider that the Bill should be amended \nso that the regulation making powers conferred by it are all made \nsubject to the affirmative resolution procedure .\n6. Clause 5 requires the Secretary of State to make regulations regarding the \nsafety standards for conversion kits for use with micromobility vehicles that \nrun on lithium-ion batteries, and relating to the use of charging systems for \nelectric-powered micromobility vehicles. Clause 6 requires the Secretary of \n1 Paragraph 12 of the Guidance for Departments , December 2023.\n2\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nState to make regulations with respect to the disposal of lithium-ion batteries. \nIn both cases, although any requirements imposed by the regulations would \nneed to be enforced in order to be effective, nothing is said on the face of the \nBill as to what provision may be made in the regulations for the enforcement \nof their requirements. As noted above, it seems to us that the only possible \nenforcement mechanisms would be either the creation of criminal offences \nor the imposition of civil sanctions.\n7. We consider that clauses 5 and 6 are defective in failing to specify \nthe provision which is to be made in the regulations to enforce the \nrequirements imposed by them. We consider that the failure to \nspecify the enforcement mechanisms is particularly objectionable \nif the intention is that they should include the creation of criminal \noffences, given the constitutional significance of using subordinate \nlegislation in this way.\n ARBITRATION BILL [HL]\n8. There is nothing in this Bill which we would wish to draw to the attention of \nthe House.\n BANK RESOLUTION (RECAPITALISATION) BILL [HL]\n9. There is nothing in this Bill which we would wish to draw to the attention of \nthe House.\n BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY BILL\n10.

Some \npeople know this as being sectioned. \nThis law is only for England and \nWales. \n2 \nWe want to change the law.   \nWhen you want to change the law, you use a Bill. \nWe write our ideas in a Bill and show \nit to Parliament. \nParliament is where people called \npoliticians meet to talk about the work of the Government.  \nThey also talk about and agree \nchanges to the law. \nWhy we want to change  \nthe law \nWe decided to make changes to the \nlaw after there was a big review. \nReview means we looked to see if the \nMental Health Act is still working. \n3 \nWe want to make changes so that you \nhave more choice in: \n•What happens if you have a\nmental health crisis.\n•Who is involved in your care.\n•What treatment you are given andwhy.\nYou will have more rights to say what you want to happen with your care and treatment. \nYour rights are things you are allowed \nto do and how you should be treated. \n4 \nPrinciples \nA principle is an idea or rule that \nexplains or tells you how something happens or works. \nWe worked closely with people who \nuse mental health services to do our review.  \nOur review helped us come up with  \n4 principles that we need to do to make things better. \nOur principles are: \n1. Respect people’s views and \nchoices \nThis means listening to what you \nwant in your mental health care. \nIn the Bill we call this Choice and \nAutonomy. \n5 \n2. Limit peoples freedom as\nlittle as possible\nThis means using the law in the\nright w\nay so you are not taken to\nhospital if you don’t need to be.\nIn the Bill we call this Least\nRestriction.\n3. Give people the help they\nneed to feel better\nThis means helping you get theright treatment and support youneed to feel well.\nIn the Bill we call this Therapeutic\nBeneﬁt.\n4.Respect people as individuals\nThis means treating you withrespect, understanding you andwhat you need.\nIn the Bill we call this The Person\nas an Individual.\n6 \nWe have thought about these \nprinciples in everything we have  done in the Bill. \nThe Code of Practice is a set of rules that services must follow when they use the Mental Health Act.   \nServices like hospitals and social care. \nSocial care is care that you get in your \nown home or in the local community.  This might be in places like a day centre or care home. \nWe will make sure that the principles \nare put in the Code of Practice. \n7 \nChanges to the law that are \nbetter for you \nWe want you to get more care and \nsupport in the community. \nUnder the Bill, doctors or people who \nare in charge of your care will: \n1.List en to what you want in\nyour mental health care.\nYour doctor or other health staff will listen and talk to you and your family and friends. \nThe\ny will ask you about what you \nwant to happen and make sure this is written down.  \n8 \n2. People will only use the \nMental Health Act when   it is needed. \nGoing to hospital should only happen \nif nothing else is working for you. \nThe Bill will: \n• Help people understand you as a \nperson and give you more of a say over your treatment. \nand \n• Make sure you are listened to and \nyour voice is heard.  It will help you \nto make choices about what care \nand treatment you want. \n9 \nYou will only have to go to hospital if \nthere is a very big chance you might: \n• Seriously hurt yourself. \n• Not get better if you don’t go to \nhospital. \n• Seriously hurt other people. \n10 \nGetting the right treatment \nin hospital \nSometimes, people need to be made \nto stay in hospital to keep themselves and others safe. \nIf you are made to go to hospital, the \nBill says there has to be a very good reason for it.  \nBefore coming into hospital, staff have \ngot to decide where is the best place for you to get treatment. \nHospital must be the best place to give you the treatment and support you need. \nWhen you are ready, you might get \ntreatment at home instead of in the hospital.  \n11 \nGetting the right treatment \nThe Bill will say that you can tell \ndoctors the treatment you want. \nBut to do this, you have to be able to \nmake decisions for yourself about what is best for you.  This is called having capacity. \nUnder the Bill, you can talk to your \ndoctor and tell them what you think works best for you. \nThey will listen to what you say.  They will tell you why they want you to have some types of medicine or treatment. \n12 \nThere might be a treatment that you \ndon’t want to have.  If this treatment helps to keep you safe, you will still have to have it. \nThis might be because the medication \nis the only one that w\norks to keep you \nwell. \nIf you do not agree with the doctor, \nyou can get a second opinion. \nA second opinion is when another \ndoctor is asked to check what treatments might be best for you. \n13 \nAdvance Choice Documents \nAn Advance Choice Document lets \npeople say what care and treatment they want before they get ill.  \nThis means doctors can still know \nwhat help you would like if you are too poorly to make decisions. \nPeople can use an Advance Choice \nDocument to say:  \n• What treatment they do and do not want if they became ill.  \n• Who they would want as their Nominated Person.   A nominated person is someone who can make decisions and speak for you. \n14 \nThe Bill says that services must tell \npeople about Advance Choice Documents. \nServices should support people to \nwrite their own Advance Choice Document, if they want one. \n15 \nCare and treatment plans \nThe Bill says everyone should have  \na care and treatment plan. \nYour doctor will write your care and \ntreatment plan with you. \nThe plan should say: \n• What you want to happen with \nyour treatment. \n• Who you want to be involved in decisions about your care. \n16 \nYour doctor or the person who is \nlooking after you will look at your care and treatment to see if it is still working.  \nThey will talk to you about your needs \nand if you want to change anything in your plan.  \nYour doctor will do everything they \ncan to make sure you are not taken  to hospital.   \nThey will only allow this if it the best \nthing for you in your care and treatment plan. \n17 \nMore about care and \ntreatment plans \nYou can ask your advocate or \nnominated person to help with the plan. \nAdvocates help you to speak out for \nyourself and have your say. \nThe plan should link in with your other \ncare plans.  \nThis means that everyone involved in \nyour care knows what is happening.  \n18 \nIf something is not right or you are \nnot happy with your care in hospital, \nyou can tell us.  This is called making a \ncomplaint. \nThe people who care for you must tell you how to do this and give you the right information. \n19 \nNominated person \nA nominated person can speak for \nyou if you are unable to make decisions yourself. \nIt is important that you choose \nsomeone who knows you well and who you can trust.  \nThe Bill says you can: \n• Choose the nominated person you \nwant, so it doesn’t have to be chosen for you. \n• Say that your nominated person must be asked about your treatment and anything that happens to you in hospital.  \n20 \nGoing to a tribunal \nYou might not agree that you need to \nstay in hospital. \nYou might need to use the law to get \na judge to say you can leave hospital. This is called going to a tribunal. \nA tribunal is like a court of law. At a tribunal, people like lawyers, \ndoctors and social workers look at what everyone says and decide what should happen. \nThe tribunal will decide if you should \nbe kept in hospital. \n21 \nThe Bill says there should be more \ntribunals for people. \nThis will make sure you do not have to stay in hospital for longer than you need to be. \n22 \nPeople who have been in \ntrouble with the law \nSome people who need care and \ntreatment for their mental health might be in trouble with the law.  They might be in prison. \nThe Bill says that people should not \nhave to wait a long time to be taken to hospital for treatment. \nThe Bill also says that people cannot \nbe taken to police cells or prisons  as a place of safety. \nA place of safety is a place people are \nmade to stay for their own safety or for other people’s protection.  \nYou do not stay in a place of safety for \nlong. A doctor comes to see you.  They will check to see if hospital is  the best place for you to go. \n23 \nSome people are in hospital because  \na court said they must stay there until they get better. \nAt the moment, some of these people \nmight have to stay in hospital even if it is no longer helping them. \nThis is because it helps to keep other \npeople safe. \nThe Bill says they should have the \nchance to live in the community under very safe rules.   \nWe call these rules conditions. \nIt is better to do this than to keep a \nperson in hospital if it is not helping them anymore.  \n24 \nPeople with a learning \ndisability and autistic \npeople \nThe mental health law can help \npeople to get the right support in hospital for a mental health condition. \nThe Bill says that mental health law \ncannot be used to keep people with  a learning disability or autistic people in hospital for more than 28 days. \nIf they also have a mental health \ncondition that can be helped in hospital, they can be made to stay  for longer.  \nIf a person with a learning disability or \nautistic person is in trouble with the law, they can be sent to hospital instead of prison. \n25 \nSome people people might be told to \nstay in hospital under the mental health law. \nIf they do the Bill says they should have a care education and treatment review. \nA care education and treatment \nreview is a meeting to see how an autistic person or a person with a learning disability is being cared for. \nThe person should only have a review \nif they agree to it. \nThis will help people to leave hospital as soon as they are ready. \n26 \nSupporting people in the \ncommunity \nPeople with a learning disability and \nautistic people don’t always need to be in hospital to get the right support. \nA Dynamic Support Register is a list \nof people who need support. Hospital, health and care staff should use the register to: \n• Understand the needs of people with a learning disability and autistic people in the area \nand \n• Make sure people are getting the \nright support. \nPeople must be asked ﬁrst if they want to be put on the register.  Staff must listen to what the person decides. \n27 \nLeaving hospital \nYou might be able to leave hospital \nwhen: \n• You feel better able to cope with your mental health \nand \n• You do not need to be in hospital \nanymore. \nWhen you leave hospital it is called being discharged. \nThe Bill says that your doctor must \nlook at your care before you leave.   \nYour doctor must speak to another \nperson involved in your care before they decide if you can be discharged. \nTogether they must make sure you \nhave the right treatment and support you need to leave hospital.  \n28 \nGetting care after you leave \nhospital \nYou may have the right to get special \ncare and treatment after you leave hospital. \nThis is to make sure you can manage \nin the community and don’t have to go back to hospital.  This is called after care. \nYou might also be given a Community \nTreatment Order by your doctor. \nThe order says what care and \ntreatment you need to stay safe and well at home. \nThe Bill makes it harder to be put on  a community treatment order if it is not the right thing for you.  \n29 \nThis Easy Read booklet was written by Easy Read UK.  \nThe pictures in this easy read are from Photosymbols and Ing Image. 30",

Th\nis Bill amends the Railways Act 1993 (“the 1993 Act”) to remove the\npresumption in favour of private sector operation of franchised passenger\nservices. It is intended to facilitate the Government’s commitment tobring such train operations back into public ownership when the currentfranchise agreements end. The Bill contains two delegated powers, and theDepartment for Transport has provided a delegated powers memorandum(“the memorandum”).\n1 We draw the attention of the House to one of those\npowers.\n2. Th\ne Bill operates by generally prohibiting both the extension of existing\nprivate sector franchise agreements and the entering into of new suchagreements. However, the Bill also inserts two new sections into the 1993Act (sections 30A and 30B) which will allow the continuation of the existingprivate sector franchise arrangements, where the Secretary of State is thefranchising authority and is satisfied that it will not be reasonably practicableto provide passenger rail services by a public sector company when theexisting private sector franchise agreement comes to an end.\n3.\nSu\nbsection (4) of section 30A enables the Secretary of State by regulations\nto repeal that section and section 30B. Despite being a Henry VIII power,the regulations are subject only to the negative resolution procedure. Theuse of the negative resolution procedure is explained in paragraph 16 of thememorandum on the basis of the limited scope of the power and the fact thatthe power is intended only for the purpose of removing the provisions oncethey become obsolete.\n4.\nWe c\nonsider that the negative resolution procedure would be appropriate if\nthe power could only be exercised once sections 30A and 30B are spent (whichwill be the case when all the existing private sector franchising arrangementshave come to an end). However, that limitation does not appear in section30A(4) as drafted; instead it simply confers a power on the Secretary of Stateto repeal sections 30A and 30B, without limiting the circumstances in whichthe power may be exercised.\n5.\nAc\ncordingly, we recommend that the House seeks clarification from\nthe Minister as to:\n• whether the Government intend that the power to repeal sections30A and 30B should only be exercised once all the existing privatesector franchising arrangements have come to an end; and\n• why, if that is the intention, the power is not limited so that itmay only be exercised in those circumstances.\nWe also take the view that, in the absence of such a limitation, the affirmative resolution procedure should apply.\n1 Memorandum on the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill from the Department for \nTransport to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (5 September 2024): https://\nbills.parliament.uk/publications/56125/documents/5043\n2\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n PRODUCT REGULATION AND METROLOGY BILL [HL]\n6. T\nhis Bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 4 September. Its Second\nReading took place on 8 October.\n7. T\nhe Bill makes provision with respect to:\n• the marketing and use of products;\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether\nof goods or other things); and\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed.\n8. T\nhe Bill contains 14 clauses and one schedule.\n9. T\nhe Department for Business and Trade has provided a Delegated Powers\nMemorandum (“the Memorandum”)2 for the Bill.\n10. W\ne draw the following powers to the attention of the House.\n Clause 1, 2, 3 and 9—powers to make product regulations\n11. T\nhese clauses make provision with respect to the regulation of the marketing\nand use of all products3 (both consumer products and industrial products)\nin the UK save only for the “excluded products” listed in the Schedule tothe Bill. The excluded products include food, products of animal origin,aircraft, military equipment, medicines and medical devices.\n12.\nC\nlause 1 gives the Secretary of State power to make provision by regulations\nin relation to the marketing or use of products in the UK (“productregulations”), for the purpose of:\n• reducing or mitigating risks presented by products;\n• ensuring that products operate efficiently or effectively; or\n• ensuring that products designed for weighing or measuring operateaccurately.\n13.\nC\nlause 1 also gives the Secretary of State power to include in product\nregulations provision which corresponds, or is similar, to a provision of EUlaw\n4 for the purpose of reducing or mitigating the environmental impact of\nproducts.\n14. C\nlause 2 sets out matters in relation to which product regulations may impose\n“product requirements”. It also specifies categories of persons on whom suchrequirements may be imposed. Clause 2(7) allows product regulations toprovide that “product requirements” are to be treated as met if requirementsof EU law specified in those regulations are met.\n2 Memorandum on the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill [HL] from the Department for Business \nand Trade to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (30 August 2024): https://\nbills.parliament. uk/publications/56126/documents/5044\n3 “Product” is broadly defined in clause 1(5) as “a tangible item that results from a method of \nproduction”.\n4 The provision must correspond, or be similar, to a provision of “relevant EU law”, which means EU \nlaw that has the purpose of harmonising the conditions for the marketing or use of products in the EU.\n3\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n15. Clause 3 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of product \nregulations.\n16. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby product regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by Parts \n2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof Acts \n1868 to 1978 and section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights Act \n2015.\n17. The power to make product regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised:\n• to create or widen the scope of a criminal offence;\n• to create powers of entry, inspection or search;\n• to disapply or modify product regulations in cases of emergency;\n• to make provision about the disclosure of information by or to a relevant \nauthority5 carrying out functions under product regulations;\n• to make provision for a relevant authority to impose fees in respect of \ncosts incurred by the authority in carrying out its functions; or\n• to amend or repeal primary legislation.\n Skeleton legislation\n18. Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill are an example of what the Committee refers \nto as “skeleton legislation”. They contain almost no substance about the \nmarketing and use of products but instead give Ministers very broad powers \nwhich confer considerable discretion to legislate in that area by statutory \ninstrument. Almost all of the substance of the regulatory regime that is to \ngovern the marketing and use of products (including product safety) is to \nbe left to regulations. Even existing provision in primary legislation may \nbe replaced by provision in regulations. And the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied.\n19. The concern with “skeleton legislation” is its compatibility with the \nestablished principle that the principal aspects of policy should be on the face \nof a bill and only its detailed implementation left to delegated legislation. As \nwe stated in our Democracy Denied Report6: “Skeleton legislation signifies \nan exceptional shift in power from Parliament to the executive and entails \nthe Government, in effect, asking Parliament to pass primary legislation \nwhich is so insubstantial that it leaves the real operation of the legislation to \nbe decided by ministers”7.\n20. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee8 states that “Skeleton legislation should only be used in the most \nexceptional circumstances”. It adds that, if a Bill contains a skeleton clause, \n5 Under clause 3, product regulations may designate a person as a “relevant authority” with powers to \nenforce product regulations.\n6 12th Report  (Session 2021–22, HL Paper 106)\n7 At para 66.\n8 Guidance for Departments (December 2023): https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/42694/\ndocuments/212126/default/\n4\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nthe Delegated Powers Memorandum that a department must prepare to assist \nthe Committee with its scrutiny of the Bill should provide a full justification \nfor this approach, including why no other approach was reasonable to adopt \nand how the scope of the skeleton provision is constrained.\n21. We consider that the Memorandum fails to meet this requirement in respect \nof clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill.\n22. The first respect in which the Memorandum falls short is in its explanation \nof the existing legislation that could be amended and indeed replaced by \nregulations made under the powers in those clauses.\n23. Both the Memorandum and the Explanatory Notes to the Bill have little to \nsay about that existing legislation beyond high-level statements such as the \nfollowing:\n• the sale and supply of the “huge number” of products to which the Bill \napplies is “underpinned by an extensive body of law”9;\n• “the legal landscape is complex and technical, primarily set out in \nsecondary legislation and based on assimilated law”10 (the body of UK \ndomestic law derived originally from EU obligations); and\n• “The product regulatory framework in the UK covers most consumer \nproducts, for example toys and cosmetics, and a significant number \nof industrial products too, such as lifts and pressure equipment. The \noverwhelming majority of this legislation is assimilated law, transposed \ninto UK law while the UK was part of the EU and then assimilated \nfollowing the EU exit process”11.\n24. The Memorandum fails to identify the legislation in question or to explain \nwhat it does or its significance in policy terms. It even fails to explain in any \ndetail the content and significance in policy terms of the primary legislation \nthat could be replaced by regulations made under the Bill.\n25. This scarcity of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make. This gives rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nthe Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might be considered \nsufficiently important in policy terms to instead merit inclusion in the \nBill itself, where they would be subject to the much greater Parliamentary \nscrutiny afforded to primary legislation.\n26. This most obviously applies to those aspects of the existing regulatory \nregime that are contained in primary legislation that the Bill allows to be \nreplaced and repealed by product regulations12. The fact that the Bill allows \nthis merits a full explanation and a compelling justification. Yet although the \nMemorandum states that the repeal of that primary legislation by regulations \nis sufficiently important to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny, it offers no \nexplanation as to why matters that have hitherto been considered sufficiently \n9 At para 2 of the Memorandum.\n10 At para 13 of the Memorandum. “Assimilated law” includes (a) post-EU Exit UK versions of EU \nRegulations, and (b) UK statutory instruments made to give effect to EU obligations.\n11 At para 5 of the Explanatory Notes.\n12 Consumer Protection Act 1987, parts  2, 4 and 5; Gun Barrel Proof Acts 1868 to  1978 ; Consumer \nRights Act 2015, section 77  and schedule 5 .\n5\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in primary legislation should be \nleft to regulations at all.\n27.  It is also unclear whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nare currently contained in assimilated law (the body of UK domestic law \nderived originally from EU obligations) that might be considered sufficiently \nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in the Bill rather than in \nregulations.\n28. Even where that assimilated law is contained in subordinate legislation, \nthat is not by itself a good reason for any replacement provisions also to be \ncontained in subordinate legislation. This is a point that we have made in \nseveral previous reports, including our report on the Medicines and Medical \nDevices Bill13, where the Government sought to justify wide skeleton powers \non the basis that it was replacing one set of regulations with another. In that \ncase, we emphasised14 that the existing regulations had been made under the \nspecial power in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, the \npurpose of which was to allow EU law requirements to be implemented in \nUK domestic law by subordinate legislation - and that the power in section \n2(2) was subject to “a critical constraint”: it gave Ministers “power to make \nlaws giving effect to EU law–not simply power to make laws that Ministers \nmay wish to make”.\n29. In our report on the Energy Bill, we stated that:\n“the fact that provisions governing a subject area are currently contained \nin regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities \nAct 1972 does not by itself make it appropriate to use a regulation-\nmaking power to amend and extend the provisions in that subject area. \nInstead, the proposal to confer regulation-making powers needs to be \njustified on its own merits, particularly where, as in these cases, they are \nframework powers which are therefore capable of providing a very broad \nscope of regulation-making powers to the Secretary of State.”15\n30. The justification given in the Memorandum for the powers in clauses 1, 2, 3 \nand 9 is that:\n• aspects of the regulatory regime for products may need to be updated \nswiftly and frequently (for example “to respond to emerging hazards \nand risks, and developments in technology and scientific or technical \nunderstanding”16); and\n• the powers will give Ministers the flexibility to legislate to align UK law \nwith EU rules or to diverge from those rules.\n31. We consider that, whilst these may be reasonable arguments for the Bill \nconferring powers that allow some aspects of the regulatory regime for \nproducts to be provided for in delegated legislation, the Government have \nnot explained why the Bill goes so much further and instead provides for \nalmost all of the substance of that regulatory regime to be provided for by \nMinisters in regulations under the new powers, with little or nothing to be \nsettled under the fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions.\n13 19th Report  (Session 2019–21, HL Paper 109).\n14 At para 20.\n15 11th Report  (Session 2022–23, HL Paper 66), para 44.\n16 At para 38.\n6\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n32. The concern with powers of this kind is that they give Ministers maximum \nflexibility to choose the direction that the law will take. Ministers could, \nshould they so wish, use these powers as a mechanism for ensuring that \nUK domestic law on product regulation is completely aligned with EU law. \nAlternatively, they could use the powers to provide for UK domestic law to \ndiverge in significant respects from EU law. Whatever direction Ministers \nmay choose to take the law in - and however significant in policy terms that \nmay be–it is to be done by means of delegated legislation that will be subject \nonly to a relatively low level of parliamentary scrutiny.\n33. The Memorandum also fails to explain why  the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirements for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied - and it fails to say whether this \nrepresents a divergence from the existing regulatory regime. We note with \ninterest that at least one existing regulation-making power that the powers to \nmake product regulations are designed to replace (the power of the Secretary \nof State under section 11 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to make \n“safety regulations” with respect to goods) is, unlike the new powers, subject \nto consultation requirements.\n Power to set the ingredients of criminal offences\n34. Clause 3(9)(a) is particularly worthy of mention. It provides that product \nregulations may create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences for such \nthings as non-compliance with product regulations or obstruction of, or \nfailure to assist or co-operate with, a product safety inspector.\n35. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee states as follows17:\n“Where the ingredients of a criminal offence are to be set by delegated \nlegislation, the Committee would expect a compelling justification”.\nThe Memorandum explains18 why it considers the power in clause 3(9)(a) to \nbe sufficiently significant to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny but it fails \nto provide a justification for taking the power in the first place.\n36. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for products; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n Clauses 5, 6 and 9—powers to make metrology regulations\n37. Clause 5 gives the Secretary of State power to make “metrology regulations”, \nabout:\n17 Guidance for Departments (November 2021), para 12: https://committees.parliament.uk/\npublications/8225/documents/84262 /default/\n18 At para 54.\n7\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether \nof goods19 or other things), including how such units of measurement \nmust or may be calculated;\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed; and\n• the units of measurement that must or may be used to express such \nquantities.\n38. Metrology regulations may impose requirements in relation to matters \nincluding:\n• the marketing or packaging of goods;\n• the monitoring, assessment and verification of the quantities in which \ngoods are marketed and the units of measurement used to express such \nquantities; and\n• the retention of documents and information.\n39. Clause 6 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of metrology \nregulations. The provision made is identical in all material respects to that \nmade in clause 3 with respect to the enforcement of product regulations.\n40. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby metrology regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by \nParts 2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof \nActs 1868 to 1978, section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights \nAct 2015 and the Weights and Measures Act 1985.\n41. The power to make metrology regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised for purposes equivalent to those specified in \nparagraph 17 above with respect to the power to make product regulations.\n42. Clauses 5, 6 and 9 are another example of “skeleton legislation”. They \ncontain almost no substance about units of measurement and the quantities \nin which goods must or may be marketed. Instead, they confer very broad \npowers to make such provision by regulations.\n43. We consider that the concerns set out above with respect to the powers to \nmake product regulations apply equally to the powers to make metrology \nregulations, namely that:\n• almost all of the substance is left to regulations;\n• skeleton legislation is only justifiable in the most exceptional \ncircumstances and the Memorandum fails to provide the full \njustification that we expect where a Bill takes this approach;\n• the Memorandum fails to adequately explain the content—and \nsignificance in policy terms—of the existing legislation that could be \namended and indeed replaced by metrology regulations;\n• this lack of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make, giving rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the existing regulatory \n19 “Goods” are broadly defined in clause 5(4) as “tangible items (including packaging or labels)”.\n8\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nregime that the Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might \nbe considered sufficiently important to merit inclusion in the Bill;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace and repeal primary \nlegislation merits a full explanation and a compelling justification but \nthe Memorandum fails to provide this;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace all aspects of the \nexisting regulatory regime that are currently contained in assimilated \nlaw merits a full explanation and justification but the Memorandum \nfails to provide this;\n• the Government argues that aspects of the regulatory regime may need \nto be updated swiftly and frequently but they have not explained why \nthe Bill provides for almost all of the substance of that regime to be \nprovided for in regulations, with little or nothing to be settled under \nthe fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions;\n• the Memorandum fails to explain why the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or \nfor meaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied; and\n• the Memorandum fails to provide a justification for the power in clause \n6(9)(a) to create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences.\n44. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for metrology; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 5, 6 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n9\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n WATER (SPECIAL MEASURES) BILL [HL]\n45.

Th\nis Bill amends the Railways Act 1993 (“the 1993 Act”) to remove the\npresumption in favour of private sector operation of franchised passenger\nservices. It is intended to facilitate the Government’s commitment tobring such train operations back into public ownership when the currentfranchise agreements end. The Bill contains two delegated powers, and theDepartment for Transport has provided a delegated powers memorandum(“the memorandum”).\n1 We draw the attention of the House to one of those\npowers.\n2. Th\ne Bill operates by generally prohibiting both the extension of existing\nprivate sector franchise agreements and the entering into of new suchagreements. However, the Bill also inserts two new sections into the 1993Act (sections 30A and 30B) which will allow the continuation of the existingprivate sector franchise arrangements, where the Secretary of State is thefranchising authority and is satisfied that it will not be reasonably practicableto provide passenger rail services by a public sector company when theexisting private sector franchise agreement comes to an end.\n3.\nSu\nbsection (4) of section 30A enables the Secretary of State by regulations\nto repeal that section and section 30B. Despite being a Henry VIII power,the regulations are subject only to the negative resolution procedure. Theuse of the negative resolution procedure is explained in paragraph 16 of thememorandum on the basis of the limited scope of the power and the fact thatthe power is intended only for the purpose of removing the provisions oncethey become obsolete.\n4.\nWe c\nonsider that the negative resolution procedure would be appropriate if\nthe power could only be exercised once sections 30A and 30B are spent (whichwill be the case when all the existing private sector franchising arrangementshave come to an end). However, that limitation does not appear in section30A(4) as drafted; instead it simply confers a power on the Secretary of Stateto repeal sections 30A and 30B, without limiting the circumstances in whichthe power may be exercised.\n5.\nAc\ncordingly, we recommend that the House seeks clarification from\nthe Minister as to:\n• whether the Government intend that the power to repeal sections30A and 30B should only be exercised once all the existing privatesector franchising arrangements have come to an end; and\n• why, if that is the intention, the power is not limited so that itmay only be exercised in those circumstances.\nWe also take the view that, in the absence of such a limitation, the affirmative resolution procedure should apply.\n1 Memorandum on the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill from the Department for \nTransport to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (5 September 2024): https://\nbills.parliament.uk/publications/56125/documents/5043\n2\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n PRODUCT REGULATION AND METROLOGY BILL [HL]\n6. T\nhis Bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 4 September. Its Second\nReading took place on 8 October.\n7. T\nhe Bill makes provision with respect to:\n• the marketing and use of products;\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether\nof goods or other things); and\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed.\n8. T\nhe Bill contains 14 clauses and one schedule.\n9. T\nhe Department for Business and Trade has provided a Delegated Powers\nMemorandum (“the Memorandum”)2 for the Bill.\n10. W\ne draw the following powers to the attention of the House.\n Clause 1, 2, 3 and 9—powers to make product regulations\n11. T\nhese clauses make provision with respect to the regulation of the marketing\nand use of all products3 (both consumer products and industrial products)\nin the UK save only for the “excluded products” listed in the Schedule tothe Bill. The excluded products include food, products of animal origin,aircraft, military equipment, medicines and medical devices.\n12.\nC\nlause 1 gives the Secretary of State power to make provision by regulations\nin relation to the marketing or use of products in the UK (“productregulations”), for the purpose of:\n• reducing or mitigating risks presented by products;\n• ensuring that products operate efficiently or effectively; or\n• ensuring that products designed for weighing or measuring operateaccurately.\n13.\nC\nlause 1 also gives the Secretary of State power to include in product\nregulations provision which corresponds, or is similar, to a provision of EUlaw\n4 for the purpose of reducing or mitigating the environmental impact of\nproducts.\n14. C\nlause 2 sets out matters in relation to which product regulations may impose\n“product requirements”. It also specifies categories of persons on whom suchrequirements may be imposed. Clause 2(7) allows product regulations toprovide that “product requirements” are to be treated as met if requirementsof EU law specified in those regulations are met.\n2 Memorandum on the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill [HL] from the Department for Business \nand Trade to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (30 August 2024): https://\nbills.parliament. uk/publications/56126/documents/5044\n3 “Product” is broadly defined in clause 1(5) as “a tangible item that results from a method of \nproduction”.\n4 The provision must correspond, or be similar, to a provision of “relevant EU law”, which means EU \nlaw that has the purpose of harmonising the conditions for the marketing or use of products in the EU.\n3\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n15. Clause 3 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of product \nregulations.\n16. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby product regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by Parts \n2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof Acts \n1868 to 1978 and section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights Act \n2015.\n17. The power to make product regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised:\n• to create or widen the scope of a criminal offence;\n• to create powers of entry, inspection or search;\n• to disapply or modify product regulations in cases of emergency;\n• to make provision about the disclosure of information by or to a relevant \nauthority5 carrying out functions under product regulations;\n• to make provision for a relevant authority to impose fees in respect of \ncosts incurred by the authority in carrying out its functions; or\n• to amend or repeal primary legislation.\n Skeleton legislation\n18. Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill are an example of what the Committee refers \nto as “skeleton legislation”. They contain almost no substance about the \nmarketing and use of products but instead give Ministers very broad powers \nwhich confer considerable discretion to legislate in that area by statutory \ninstrument. Almost all of the substance of the regulatory regime that is to \ngovern the marketing and use of products (including product safety) is to \nbe left to regulations. Even existing provision in primary legislation may \nbe replaced by provision in regulations. And the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied.\n19. The concern with “skeleton legislation” is its compatibility with the \nestablished principle that the principal aspects of policy should be on the face \nof a bill and only its detailed implementation left to delegated legislation. As \nwe stated in our Democracy Denied Report6: “Skeleton legislation signifies \nan exceptional shift in power from Parliament to the executive and entails \nthe Government, in effect, asking Parliament to pass primary legislation \nwhich is so insubstantial that it leaves the real operation of the legislation to \nbe decided by ministers”7.\n20. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee8 states that “Skeleton legislation should only be used in the most \nexceptional circumstances”. It adds that, if a Bill contains a skeleton clause, \n5 Under clause 3, product regulations may designate a person as a “relevant authority” with powers to \nenforce product regulations.\n6 12th Report  (Session 2021–22, HL Paper 106)\n7 At para 66.\n8 Guidance for Departments (December 2023): https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/42694/\ndocuments/212126/default/\n4\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nthe Delegated Powers Memorandum that a department must prepare to assist \nthe Committee with its scrutiny of the Bill should provide a full justification \nfor this approach, including why no other approach was reasonable to adopt \nand how the scope of the skeleton provision is constrained.\n21. We consider that the Memorandum fails to meet this requirement in respect \nof clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill.\n22. The first respect in which the Memorandum falls short is in its explanation \nof the existing legislation that could be amended and indeed replaced by \nregulations made under the powers in those clauses.\n23. Both the Memorandum and the Explanatory Notes to the Bill have little to \nsay about that existing legislation beyond high-level statements such as the \nfollowing:\n• the sale and supply of the “huge number” of products to which the Bill \napplies is “underpinned by an extensive body of law”9;\n• “the legal landscape is complex and technical, primarily set out in \nsecondary legislation and based on assimilated law”10 (the body of UK \ndomestic law derived originally from EU obligations); and\n• “The product regulatory framework in the UK covers most consumer \nproducts, for example toys and cosmetics, and a significant number \nof industrial products too, such as lifts and pressure equipment. The \noverwhelming majority of this legislation is assimilated law, transposed \ninto UK law while the UK was part of the EU and then assimilated \nfollowing the EU exit process”11.\n24. The Memorandum fails to identify the legislation in question or to explain \nwhat it does or its significance in policy terms. It even fails to explain in any \ndetail the content and significance in policy terms of the primary legislation \nthat could be replaced by regulations made under the Bill.\n25. This scarcity of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make. This gives rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nthe Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might be considered \nsufficiently important in policy terms to instead merit inclusion in the \nBill itself, where they would be subject to the much greater Parliamentary \nscrutiny afforded to primary legislation.\n26. This most obviously applies to those aspects of the existing regulatory \nregime that are contained in primary legislation that the Bill allows to be \nreplaced and repealed by product regulations12. The fact that the Bill allows \nthis merits a full explanation and a compelling justification. Yet although the \nMemorandum states that the repeal of that primary legislation by regulations \nis sufficiently important to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny, it offers no \nexplanation as to why matters that have hitherto been considered sufficiently \n9 At para 2 of the Memorandum.\n10 At para 13 of the Memorandum. “Assimilated law” includes (a) post-EU Exit UK versions of EU \nRegulations, and (b) UK statutory instruments made to give effect to EU obligations.\n11 At para 5 of the Explanatory Notes.\n12 Consumer Protection Act 1987, parts  2, 4 and 5; Gun Barrel Proof Acts 1868 to  1978 ; Consumer \nRights Act 2015, section 77  and schedule 5 .\n5\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in primary legislation should be \nleft to regulations at all.\n27.  It is also unclear whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nare currently contained in assimilated law (the body of UK domestic law \nderived originally from EU obligations) that might be considered sufficiently \nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in the Bill rather than in \nregulations.\n28. Even where that assimilated law is contained in subordinate legislation, \nthat is not by itself a good reason for any replacement provisions also to be \ncontained in subordinate legislation. This is a point that we have made in \nseveral previous reports, including our report on the Medicines and Medical \nDevices Bill13, where the Government sought to justify wide skeleton powers \non the basis that it was replacing one set of regulations with another. In that \ncase, we emphasised14 that the existing regulations had been made under the \nspecial power in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, the \npurpose of which was to allow EU law requirements to be implemented in \nUK domestic law by subordinate legislation - and that the power in section \n2(2) was subject to “a critical constraint”: it gave Ministers “power to make \nlaws giving effect to EU law–not simply power to make laws that Ministers \nmay wish to make”.\n29. In our report on the Energy Bill, we stated that:\n“the fact that provisions governing a subject area are currently contained \nin regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities \nAct 1972 does not by itself make it appropriate to use a regulation-\nmaking power to amend and extend the provisions in that subject area. \nInstead, the proposal to confer regulation-making powers needs to be \njustified on its own merits, particularly where, as in these cases, they are \nframework powers which are therefore capable of providing a very broad \nscope of regulation-making powers to the Secretary of State.”15\n30. The justification given in the Memorandum for the powers in clauses 1, 2, 3 \nand 9 is that:\n• aspects of the regulatory regime for products may need to be updated \nswiftly and frequently (for example “to respond to emerging hazards \nand risks, and developments in technology and scientific or technical \nunderstanding”16); and\n• the powers will give Ministers the flexibility to legislate to align UK law \nwith EU rules or to diverge from those rules.\n31. We consider that, whilst these may be reasonable arguments for the Bill \nconferring powers that allow some aspects of the regulatory regime for \nproducts to be provided for in delegated legislation, the Government have \nnot explained why the Bill goes so much further and instead provides for \nalmost all of the substance of that regulatory regime to be provided for by \nMinisters in regulations under the new powers, with little or nothing to be \nsettled under the fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions.\n13 19th Report  (Session 2019–21, HL Paper 109).\n14 At para 20.\n15 11th Report  (Session 2022–23, HL Paper 66), para 44.\n16 At para 38.\n6\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n32. The concern with powers of this kind is that they give Ministers maximum \nflexibility to choose the direction that the law will take. Ministers could, \nshould they so wish, use these powers as a mechanism for ensuring that \nUK domestic law on product regulation is completely aligned with EU law. \nAlternatively, they could use the powers to provide for UK domestic law to \ndiverge in significant respects from EU law. Whatever direction Ministers \nmay choose to take the law in - and however significant in policy terms that \nmay be–it is to be done by means of delegated legislation that will be subject \nonly to a relatively low level of parliamentary scrutiny.\n33. The Memorandum also fails to explain why  the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirements for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied - and it fails to say whether this \nrepresents a divergence from the existing regulatory regime. We note with \ninterest that at least one existing regulation-making power that the powers to \nmake product regulations are designed to replace (the power of the Secretary \nof State under section 11 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to make \n“safety regulations” with respect to goods) is, unlike the new powers, subject \nto consultation requirements.\n Power to set the ingredients of criminal offences\n34. Clause 3(9)(a) is particularly worthy of mention. It provides that product \nregulations may create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences for such \nthings as non-compliance with product regulations or obstruction of, or \nfailure to assist or co-operate with, a product safety inspector.\n35. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee states as follows17:\n“Where the ingredients of a criminal offence are to be set by delegated \nlegislation, the Committee would expect a compelling justification”.\nThe Memorandum explains18 why it considers the power in clause 3(9)(a) to \nbe sufficiently significant to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny but it fails \nto provide a justification for taking the power in the first place.\n36. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for products; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n Clauses 5, 6 and 9—powers to make metrology regulations\n37. Clause 5 gives the Secretary of State power to make “metrology regulations”, \nabout:\n17 Guidance for Departments (November 2021), para 12: https://committees.parliament.uk/\npublications/8225/documents/84262 /default/\n18 At para 54.\n7\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether \nof goods19 or other things), including how such units of measurement \nmust or may be calculated;\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed; and\n• the units of measurement that must or may be used to express such \nquantities.\n38. Metrology regulations may impose requirements in relation to matters \nincluding:\n• the marketing or packaging of goods;\n• the monitoring, assessment and verification of the quantities in which \ngoods are marketed and the units of measurement used to express such \nquantities; and\n• the retention of documents and information.\n39. Clause 6 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of metrology \nregulations. The provision made is identical in all material respects to that \nmade in clause 3 with respect to the enforcement of product regulations.\n40. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby metrology regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by \nParts 2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof \nActs 1868 to 1978, section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights \nAct 2015 and the Weights and Measures Act 1985.\n41. The power to make metrology regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised for purposes equivalent to those specified in \nparagraph 17 above with respect to the power to make product regulations.\n42. Clauses 5, 6 and 9 are another example of “skeleton legislation”. They \ncontain almost no substance about units of measurement and the quantities \nin which goods must or may be marketed. Instead, they confer very broad \npowers to make such provision by regulations.\n43. We consider that the concerns set out above with respect to the powers to \nmake product regulations apply equally to the powers to make metrology \nregulations, namely that:\n• almost all of the substance is left to regulations;\n• skeleton legislation is only justifiable in the most exceptional \ncircumstances and the Memorandum fails to provide the full \njustification that we expect where a Bill takes this approach;\n• the Memorandum fails to adequately explain the content—and \nsignificance in policy terms—of the existing legislation that could be \namended and indeed replaced by metrology regulations;\n• this lack of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make, giving rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the existing regulatory \n19 “Goods” are broadly defined in clause 5(4) as “tangible items (including packaging or labels)”.\n8\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nregime that the Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might \nbe considered sufficiently important to merit inclusion in the Bill;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace and repeal primary \nlegislation merits a full explanation and a compelling justification but \nthe Memorandum fails to provide this;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace all aspects of the \nexisting regulatory regime that are currently contained in assimilated \nlaw merits a full explanation and justification but the Memorandum \nfails to provide this;\n• the Government argues that aspects of the regulatory regime may need \nto be updated swiftly and frequently but they have not explained why \nthe Bill provides for almost all of the substance of that regime to be \nprovided for in regulations, with little or nothing to be settled under \nthe fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions;\n• the Memorandum fails to explain why the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or \nfor meaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied; and\n• the Memorandum fails to provide a justification for the power in clause \n6(9)(a) to create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences.\n44. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for metrology; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 5, 6 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n9\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n WATER (SPECIAL MEASURES) BILL [HL]\n45.

Th\nis Bill amends the Railways Act 1993 (“the 1993 Act”) to remove the\npresumption in favour of private sector operation of franchised passenger\nservices. It is intended to facilitate the Government’s commitment tobring such train operations back into public ownership when the currentfranchise agreements end. The Bill contains two delegated powers, and theDepartment for Transport has provided a delegated powers memorandum(“the memorandum”).\n1 We draw the attention of the House to one of those\npowers.\n2. Th\ne Bill operates by generally prohibiting both the extension of existing\nprivate sector franchise agreements and the entering into of new suchagreements. However, the Bill also inserts two new sections into the 1993Act (sections 30A and 30B) which will allow the continuation of the existingprivate sector franchise arrangements, where the Secretary of State is thefranchising authority and is satisfied that it will not be reasonably practicableto provide passenger rail services by a public sector company when theexisting private sector franchise agreement comes to an end.\n3.\nSu\nbsection (4) of section 30A enables the Secretary of State by regulations\nto repeal that section and section 30B. Despite being a Henry VIII power,the regulations are subject only to the negative resolution procedure. Theuse of the negative resolution procedure is explained in paragraph 16 of thememorandum on the basis of the limited scope of the power and the fact thatthe power is intended only for the purpose of removing the provisions oncethey become obsolete.\n4.\nWe c\nonsider that the negative resolution procedure would be appropriate if\nthe power could only be exercised once sections 30A and 30B are spent (whichwill be the case when all the existing private sector franchising arrangementshave come to an end). However, that limitation does not appear in section30A(4) as drafted; instead it simply confers a power on the Secretary of Stateto repeal sections 30A and 30B, without limiting the circumstances in whichthe power may be exercised.\n5.\nAc\ncordingly, we recommend that the House seeks clarification from\nthe Minister as to:\n• whether the Government intend that the power to repeal sections30A and 30B should only be exercised once all the existing privatesector franchising arrangements have come to an end; and\n• why, if that is the intention, the power is not limited so that itmay only be exercised in those circumstances.\nWe also take the view that, in the absence of such a limitation, the affirmative resolution procedure should apply.\n1 Memorandum on the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill from the Department for \nTransport to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (5 September 2024): https://\nbills.parliament.uk/publications/56125/documents/5043\n2\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n PRODUCT REGULATION AND METROLOGY BILL [HL]\n6. T\nhis Bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 4 September. Its Second\nReading took place on 8 October.\n7. T\nhe Bill makes provision with respect to:\n• the marketing and use of products;\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether\nof goods or other things); and\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed.\n8. T\nhe Bill contains 14 clauses and one schedule.\n9. T\nhe Department for Business and Trade has provided a Delegated Powers\nMemorandum (“the Memorandum”)2 for the Bill.\n10. W\ne draw the following powers to the attention of the House.\n Clause 1, 2, 3 and 9—powers to make product regulations\n11. T\nhese clauses make provision with respect to the regulation of the marketing\nand use of all products3 (both consumer products and industrial products)\nin the UK save only for the “excluded products” listed in the Schedule tothe Bill. The excluded products include food, products of animal origin,aircraft, military equipment, medicines and medical devices.\n12.\nC\nlause 1 gives the Secretary of State power to make provision by regulations\nin relation to the marketing or use of products in the UK (“productregulations”), for the purpose of:\n• reducing or mitigating risks presented by products;\n• ensuring that products operate efficiently or effectively; or\n• ensuring that products designed for weighing or measuring operateaccurately.\n13.\nC\nlause 1 also gives the Secretary of State power to include in product\nregulations provision which corresponds, or is similar, to a provision of EUlaw\n4 for the purpose of reducing or mitigating the environmental impact of\nproducts.\n14. C\nlause 2 sets out matters in relation to which product regulations may impose\n“product requirements”. It also specifies categories of persons on whom suchrequirements may be imposed. Clause 2(7) allows product regulations toprovide that “product requirements” are to be treated as met if requirementsof EU law specified in those regulations are met.\n2 Memorandum on the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill [HL] from the Department for Business \nand Trade to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (30 August 2024): https://\nbills.parliament. uk/publications/56126/documents/5044\n3 “Product” is broadly defined in clause 1(5) as “a tangible item that results from a method of \nproduction”.\n4 The provision must correspond, or be similar, to a provision of “relevant EU law”, which means EU \nlaw that has the purpose of harmonising the conditions for the marketing or use of products in the EU.\n3\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n15. Clause 3 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of product \nregulations.\n16. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby product regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by Parts \n2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof Acts \n1868 to 1978 and section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights Act \n2015.\n17. The power to make product regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised:\n• to create or widen the scope of a criminal offence;\n• to create powers of entry, inspection or search;\n• to disapply or modify product regulations in cases of emergency;\n• to make provision about the disclosure of information by or to a relevant \nauthority5 carrying out functions under product regulations;\n• to make provision for a relevant authority to impose fees in respect of \ncosts incurred by the authority in carrying out its functions; or\n• to amend or repeal primary legislation.\n Skeleton legislation\n18. Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill are an example of what the Committee refers \nto as “skeleton legislation”. They contain almost no substance about the \nmarketing and use of products but instead give Ministers very broad powers \nwhich confer considerable discretion to legislate in that area by statutory \ninstrument. Almost all of the substance of the regulatory regime that is to \ngovern the marketing and use of products (including product safety) is to \nbe left to regulations. Even existing provision in primary legislation may \nbe replaced by provision in regulations. And the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied.\n19. The concern with “skeleton legislation” is its compatibility with the \nestablished principle that the principal aspects of policy should be on the face \nof a bill and only its detailed implementation left to delegated legislation. As \nwe stated in our Democracy Denied Report6: “Skeleton legislation signifies \nan exceptional shift in power from Parliament to the executive and entails \nthe Government, in effect, asking Parliament to pass primary legislation \nwhich is so insubstantial that it leaves the real operation of the legislation to \nbe decided by ministers”7.\n20. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee8 states that “Skeleton legislation should only be used in the most \nexceptional circumstances”. It adds that, if a Bill contains a skeleton clause, \n5 Under clause 3, product regulations may designate a person as a “relevant authority” with powers to \nenforce product regulations.\n6 12th Report  (Session 2021–22, HL Paper 106)\n7 At para 66.\n8 Guidance for Departments (December 2023): https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/42694/\ndocuments/212126/default/\n4\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nthe Delegated Powers Memorandum that a department must prepare to assist \nthe Committee with its scrutiny of the Bill should provide a full justification \nfor this approach, including why no other approach was reasonable to adopt \nand how the scope of the skeleton provision is constrained.\n21. We consider that the Memorandum fails to meet this requirement in respect \nof clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill.\n22. The first respect in which the Memorandum falls short is in its explanation \nof the existing legislation that could be amended and indeed replaced by \nregulations made under the powers in those clauses.\n23. Both the Memorandum and the Explanatory Notes to the Bill have little to \nsay about that existing legislation beyond high-level statements such as the \nfollowing:\n• the sale and supply of the “huge number” of products to which the Bill \napplies is “underpinned by an extensive body of law”9;\n• “the legal landscape is complex and technical, primarily set out in \nsecondary legislation and based on assimilated law”10 (the body of UK \ndomestic law derived originally from EU obligations); and\n• “The product regulatory framework in the UK covers most consumer \nproducts, for example toys and cosmetics, and a significant number \nof industrial products too, such as lifts and pressure equipment. The \noverwhelming majority of this legislation is assimilated law, transposed \ninto UK law while the UK was part of the EU and then assimilated \nfollowing the EU exit process”11.\n24. The Memorandum fails to identify the legislation in question or to explain \nwhat it does or its significance in policy terms. It even fails to explain in any \ndetail the content and significance in policy terms of the primary legislation \nthat could be replaced by regulations made under the Bill.\n25. This scarcity of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make. This gives rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nthe Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might be considered \nsufficiently important in policy terms to instead merit inclusion in the \nBill itself, where they would be subject to the much greater Parliamentary \nscrutiny afforded to primary legislation.\n26. This most obviously applies to those aspects of the existing regulatory \nregime that are contained in primary legislation that the Bill allows to be \nreplaced and repealed by product regulations12. The fact that the Bill allows \nthis merits a full explanation and a compelling justification. Yet although the \nMemorandum states that the repeal of that primary legislation by regulations \nis sufficiently important to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny, it offers no \nexplanation as to why matters that have hitherto been considered sufficiently \n9 At para 2 of the Memorandum.\n10 At para 13 of the Memorandum. “Assimilated law” includes (a) post-EU Exit UK versions of EU \nRegulations, and (b) UK statutory instruments made to give effect to EU obligations.\n11 At para 5 of the Explanatory Notes.\n12 Consumer Protection Act 1987, parts  2, 4 and 5; Gun Barrel Proof Acts 1868 to  1978 ; Consumer \nRights Act 2015, section 77  and schedule 5 .\n5\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in primary legislation should be \nleft to regulations at all.\n27.  It is also unclear whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nare currently contained in assimilated law (the body of UK domestic law \nderived originally from EU obligations) that might be considered sufficiently \nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in the Bill rather than in \nregulations.\n28. Even where that assimilated law is contained in subordinate legislation, \nthat is not by itself a good reason for any replacement provisions also to be \ncontained in subordinate legislation. This is a point that we have made in \nseveral previous reports, including our report on the Medicines and Medical \nDevices Bill13, where the Government sought to justify wide skeleton powers \non the basis that it was replacing one set of regulations with another. In that \ncase, we emphasised14 that the existing regulations had been made under the \nspecial power in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, the \npurpose of which was to allow EU law requirements to be implemented in \nUK domestic law by subordinate legislation - and that the power in section \n2(2) was subject to “a critical constraint”: it gave Ministers “power to make \nlaws giving effect to EU law–not simply power to make laws that Ministers \nmay wish to make”.\n29. In our report on the Energy Bill, we stated that:\n“the fact that provisions governing a subject area are currently contained \nin regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities \nAct 1972 does not by itself make it appropriate to use a regulation-\nmaking power to amend and extend the provisions in that subject area. \nInstead, the proposal to confer regulation-making powers needs to be \njustified on its own merits, particularly where, as in these cases, they are \nframework powers which are therefore capable of providing a very broad \nscope of regulation-making powers to the Secretary of State.”15\n30. The justification given in the Memorandum for the powers in clauses 1, 2, 3 \nand 9 is that:\n• aspects of the regulatory regime for products may need to be updated \nswiftly and frequently (for example “to respond to emerging hazards \nand risks, and developments in technology and scientific or technical \nunderstanding”16); and\n• the powers will give Ministers the flexibility to legislate to align UK law \nwith EU rules or to diverge from those rules.\n31. We consider that, whilst these may be reasonable arguments for the Bill \nconferring powers that allow some aspects of the regulatory regime for \nproducts to be provided for in delegated legislation, the Government have \nnot explained why the Bill goes so much further and instead provides for \nalmost all of the substance of that regulatory regime to be provided for by \nMinisters in regulations under the new powers, with little or nothing to be \nsettled under the fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions.\n13 19th Report  (Session 2019–21, HL Paper 109).\n14 At para 20.\n15 11th Report  (Session 2022–23, HL Paper 66), para 44.\n16 At para 38.\n6\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n32. The concern with powers of this kind is that they give Ministers maximum \nflexibility to choose the direction that the law will take. Ministers could, \nshould they so wish, use these powers as a mechanism for ensuring that \nUK domestic law on product regulation is completely aligned with EU law. \nAlternatively, they could use the powers to provide for UK domestic law to \ndiverge in significant respects from EU law. Whatever direction Ministers \nmay choose to take the law in - and however significant in policy terms that \nmay be–it is to be done by means of delegated legislation that will be subject \nonly to a relatively low level of parliamentary scrutiny.\n33. The Memorandum also fails to explain why  the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirements for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied - and it fails to say whether this \nrepresents a divergence from the existing regulatory regime. We note with \ninterest that at least one existing regulation-making power that the powers to \nmake product regulations are designed to replace (the power of the Secretary \nof State under section 11 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to make \n“safety regulations” with respect to goods) is, unlike the new powers, subject \nto consultation requirements.\n Power to set the ingredients of criminal offences\n34. Clause 3(9)(a) is particularly worthy of mention. It provides that product \nregulations may create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences for such \nthings as non-compliance with product regulations or obstruction of, or \nfailure to assist or co-operate with, a product safety inspector.\n35. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee states as follows17:\n“Where the ingredients of a criminal offence are to be set by delegated \nlegislation, the Committee would expect a compelling justification”.\nThe Memorandum explains18 why it considers the power in clause 3(9)(a) to \nbe sufficiently significant to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny but it fails \nto provide a justification for taking the power in the first place.\n36. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for products; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n Clauses 5, 6 and 9—powers to make metrology regulations\n37. Clause 5 gives the Secretary of State power to make “metrology regulations”, \nabout:\n17 Guidance for Departments (November 2021), para 12: https://committees.parliament.uk/\npublications/8225/documents/84262 /default/\n18 At para 54.\n7\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether \nof goods19 or other things), including how such units of measurement \nmust or may be calculated;\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed; and\n• the units of measurement that must or may be used to express such \nquantities.\n38. Metrology regulations may impose requirements in relation to matters \nincluding:\n• the marketing or packaging of goods;\n• the monitoring, assessment and verification of the quantities in which \ngoods are marketed and the units of measurement used to express such \nquantities; and\n• the retention of documents and information.\n39. Clause 6 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of metrology \nregulations. The provision made is identical in all material respects to that \nmade in clause 3 with respect to the enforcement of product regulations.\n40. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby metrology regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by \nParts 2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof \nActs 1868 to 1978, section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights \nAct 2015 and the Weights and Measures Act 1985.\n41. The power to make metrology regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised for purposes equivalent to those specified in \nparagraph 17 above with respect to the power to make product regulations.\n42. Clauses 5, 6 and 9 are another example of “skeleton legislation”. They \ncontain almost no substance about units of measurement and the quantities \nin which goods must or may be marketed. Instead, they confer very broad \npowers to make such provision by regulations.\n43. We consider that the concerns set out above with respect to the powers to \nmake product regulations apply equally to the powers to make metrology \nregulations, namely that:\n• almost all of the substance is left to regulations;\n• skeleton legislation is only justifiable in the most exceptional \ncircumstances and the Memorandum fails to provide the full \njustification that we expect where a Bill takes this approach;\n• the Memorandum fails to adequately explain the content—and \nsignificance in policy terms—of the existing legislation that could be \namended and indeed replaced by metrology regulations;\n• this lack of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make, giving rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the existing regulatory \n19 “Goods” are broadly defined in clause 5(4) as “tangible items (including packaging or labels)”.\n8\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nregime that the Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might \nbe considered sufficiently important to merit inclusion in the Bill;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace and repeal primary \nlegislation merits a full explanation and a compelling justification but \nthe Memorandum fails to provide this;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace all aspects of the \nexisting regulatory regime that are currently contained in assimilated \nlaw merits a full explanation and justification but the Memorandum \nfails to provide this;\n• the Government argues that aspects of the regulatory regime may need \nto be updated swiftly and frequently but they have not explained why \nthe Bill provides for almost all of the substance of that regime to be \nprovided for in regulations, with little or nothing to be settled under \nthe fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions;\n• the Memorandum fails to explain why the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or \nfor meaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied; and\n• the Memorandum fails to provide a justification for the power in clause \n6(9)(a) to create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences.\n44. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for metrology; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 5, 6 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n9\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n WATER (SPECIAL MEASURES) BILL [HL]\n45.

This Bill, which was introduced in the House of Lords on 17 December \n2024 and had its Second Reading on 8 January 2025, is expected to begin \nCommittee Stage on 28 January.\n2. The Bill makes provision to facilitate the operation of franchise bus services \nby local transport authorities, to safeguard “socially necessary” services \nwhere local transport authorities operate “enhanced partnership” models \nand to make it easier for local authorities to create their own municipal bus \ncompanies. It also makes provision in a number of areas relating to safety \nand accessibility of buses and restricts the use of new non-zero emission \nbuses on registered local bus services.\n3. The Department for Transport is responsible for the Bill and has published \na Delegated Powers Memorandum (“the Memorandum”).1\n4. The Bill includes thirty delegated powers. We draw the attention of the \nHouse to one matter.\n Clause 27—use of zero-emission vehicles for registered local services \nin England\n5. Clause 27 inserts a new section 151A in the Transport Act 2000. The new \nsection 151A(1) prohibits the use of new non-zero emissions vehicles for \nlocal bus services in England which are registered under section 6 of the \nTransport Act 1985. Whether or not a vehicle is new will be determined by a \ndate to be set in regulations.\n6. Non-zero emissions vehicles are those which emit any of the following from \nthe tailpipe: carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide \nand particulates. The restriction of scope to services which are registered \nunder section 6 of the 1985 Act means that franchised services, including \nservices in Greater London, are not affected by the prohibition.2\n7. The prohibition applies to vehicles which have more than 22 passenger seats \nand will affect vehicles that are first registered under the Vehicle Excise and \nRegistration Act 1994 on or after the date set in regulations. That date may \nnot be before 1 January 2030.\n8. The delegated power is in clause 27(3) and is subject to the negative \nprocedure.3\n1 Memorandum on the Bus Services (No. 2) Bill [HL] from the Department for Transport to the \nDelegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (21 January 2024): https://bills.parliament.uk/\npublications/57869/documents/5668 \n2 The Explanatory Notes explain at paragraph 108 that where franchising is in place the decision on \nwhether to phase out non-zero emissions vehicles and its timing would be a local one, with the local \ntransport authority setting the emissions expectations taking into account local needs and franchising \ncosts.\n3 In addition to the power to set the date, the regulations may contain provision specifying the \ndocuments that can evidence the absence of tailpipe emissions and provision exempting services from \nthe prohibition. These additional matters are not relevant to the issue raised in this report.\n2\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n9. The Memorandum explains that this restriction on the use of new non-zero \nemissions buses would deliver significant environmental and air quality \nbenefits and contribute to the UK meeting its interim carbon budget and \nnet-zero emissions targets under the Climate Change Act 2008.\n10. The Explanatory Notes further explain that bus operators have begun to \ninvest in new technology and that local transport authorities have begun \nto move to, or plan for, zero-emission fleets. The prohibition is intended to \nhelp accelerate bus decarbonisation by giving greater certainty of demand \nfor zero-emission buses to manufacturers.\n11. The Memorandum justifies the use of negative resolution procedure on the \nbasis that the content of the regulations will be very limited and that the \nBill setting the earliest possible date means that those affected will have \nsufficient notice.\n12. It is not necessarily the case that regulations with limited content (such as \na date) have a limited effect. Setting a date in this case will likely require \njudgments to be made about issues including the state of technology, readiness \nof the supply chain, the cost and availability of compliant vehicles, and the \nbalance of environmental impacts such as the extent to which old vehicles \nwill be scrapped as well as positive air quality and greenhouse gas emissions \noutcomes. The impacts of the decision on timing are of direct interest to bus \nmanufacturers and others in the supply chain, bus operators, local transport \nauthorities and passengers, and indirect interest to many more. Furthermore, \nthe decision is part of the government’s broader decarbonisation policy and \nmove to phasing out non-zero emissions road vehicles of other types, such as \ncars and vans.\n13. We recommend that in light of the complex judgments to be made \nin setting a date for the phase out of non-zero emissions buses from \nregistered local bus services, the effect on a wide range of people and \norganisations, and the broader interest in decarbonisation policy, the \npower in clause 27(3) is made subject to the affirmative procedure.\n3\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n PRIVATE MEMBER’S BILL: INTRODUCTORY NOTE\n14. T\nhis report sets out the Committee’s observations in relation to one private\nmember’s Bill. It has long been, and remains, the Committee’s approach to\napply the same exacting standards of scrutiny to all bills, whether a government bill or a private member’s bill. We acknowledge however that those membersof the House who sponsor private members’ bills, unlike ministers, do nothave the support of departmental officials and Parliamentary Counsel inthe preparation of their bills. Our comments on private members’ bills areframed in the light of that understanding.\n PERMITTED DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS (EXTENSION) BILL\n[HL]\n15.\n \nThis private member’s Bill, which is expected to have its Second Reading on\n7 February 2025, makes provision for new permitted development rights inrelation to the development of residential property in England and Wales.A permitted development right is a right to develop land that falls within itsscope without the need for planning permission. The Bill uses numerousterms and expressions used in the existing system of planning legislation andtherefore seems intended to form a discrete part of that system. It includesseven delegated powers.\n16.\nW\ne draw the attention of the House to two matters.\n Clauses 2(2), 2(3), 2(4)(b), 2(5) and 4—potentially ineffective delegated\npowers\n17. E\nach of the delegated powers in clauses 2(2), 2(3), 2(4)(b), 2(5) and 4 permit\nthe Secretary of State to set additional technical requirements or standards\nwhich may be required when a new permitted development right is reliedon. They relate, respectively, to slowing rainwater run-off, structural safety,insulation or energy efficiency, offsetting urban heat island effect, and floodresilience.\n18.\nU\nnder existing planning legislation compliance with a permitted development\nright is deemed to be compliance with planning permission, so if a permitteddevelopment right under existing legislation was purportedly relied on fordevelopment outside its scope, or conditions attached to it were not met, thedeveloper would be subject to enforcement action.\n4\n19. H owever, the Bill does not link its central term “new permitted development\nright” in any way to the existing legislation, for example by providing thatthose complying with a new permitted development right are deemed to haveplanning permission for the development.\n20.\nI\nt follows that development that complies with a new permitted development\nright under the Bill would still require planning permission and that any\n4 In England and Wales planning permission is required by section 57(1) of the Town and Country \nPlanning Act 1990 and in England, article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted \nDevelopment) (England) Order (SI 2015/596) provides that planning permission is granted for the classes of development set out as permitted development rights in Schedule 2 to the Order. Equivalent provision for Wales is made in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. Enforcement related powers, procedures and sanctions for breach are set out in Part 7 of the 1990 Act. \n4\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nexercise of the delegated powers to set requirements and standards in relation \nto those rights would be without full legal effect.\n21. We recommend that the Bill is amended so that the delegated powers \nin clauses 2(2), 2(3), 2(4)(b), 2(5) and 4 are capable of having full effect \nif they are exercised.\n Clause 4—permitted development rights: flood zones\n22. Clause 4 confers a power on the Secretary of State to make regulations \nspecifying standards of flood resilience to be required where a new permitted \ndevelopment right is relied on in an area within the clause’s scope. The scope \nof the clause is expressed to be residential buildings within flood zones 2 \nand 3 which are “well serviced by public transport”. The meaning of “well \nserviced by public transport” is left to be defined in regulations made by the \nSecretary of State.\n23. It is not possible to understand the true scope of the power without knowing \nthe meaning of “well serviced by public transport”. In particular it is not \npossible to know whether exercise of the power would affect a significant \namount of flood-vulnerable property or not. A term that significantly affects \nthe scope of a delegated power should be set out fully on the face of the Bill.\n24. We consider that clause 4 inappropriately delegates an essential \nelement of its scope to be defined in secondary legislation and that \nthe meaning of the term “well serviced by public transport” should \nbe set out on the face of the Bill.\n5\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n NON-DOMESTIC RATING (MULTIPLIERS AND PRIVATE \nSCHOOLS) BILL\n25. There is nothing in this Bill which we would wish to draw to the attention of \nthe House.\n6\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nAPPENDIX 1:  MEMBERS’ INTERESTS\nCommittee Members’ registered interests may be examined in the online Register \nof Lords’ Interests at https://www.parliament.uk/hlregister .

    "body": "Baroness Jones  of Whitchurch  \nParliamentary Under Secretary of State  \nDepartment for Science, Innovation & \nTechnology  \n100 Parliament Street  \nLondon SW1A 2BQ  \n \nwww.gov.uk/dsit  \n   \n 6 January  2025 \n \n \nDear Viscount Camrose , \n \nPublic Authority Algorithmic and Automated Decision -Making Systems Bill – Second \nReading Debate  \n \nI am writing in response to the important questions you raised during the deb ate on Lord \nClement -Jones' Public Authority Algorithmic and Automated Decision -Making Systems Bill  on \nFriday 13 December. I  will also place a copy of this letter in the libraries of both Houses.  \n \nI would like to thank you for your thoughtful contributions  and hope you will be pleased to note \nthat we published 14 new records on the Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard \n(ATRS) online Hub  on Tuesday 17 December.  More should follow in the coming weeks . As I \nstated during the debate, we are confident that the ATRS policy mandate, delivered from the \nnew digital centre of government, is sufficient to deliver meaningful transparency in government  \nalgorithmic tools which affect members of the public.  \n \nYou asked what consideration will be given to ensure that public authorities can remain agile \nand responsive given the rapid rate of technological change,  a challenge which the government \ntakes very seriously. You also referenced  the principles -based approach set out in the AI White \nPaper , and suggested that they provide a flexible means for achieving the  goals of Lord \nClement -Jones' Bill ( that is, transparent and trustworthy uses of algorithmic  and automated \ntools  in the public sector).  Finally, you asked what  measures will be considered to build public \ntrust in AI systems, ensuring that the public understand both the decisions made and the \nsafeguards in place around them . \n \nSupporting the public  sector  \n \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is at the heart of the UK Government’s plan to kickstart an era of \neconomic growth, transform how we deliver public services, and boost living standards for \nworking people across the country.     \n \nWhere public bodies are concerned, we are guiding the responsible development, deployment, \nand use of these technologies through a range of policies, frameworks and standards. This \nincludes the Generative AI Framework, the Data Ethics Framework, the Model for Responsible \nInnovation, and the Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS), all of which reflect \nprinciples set out in the AI regulation whitepaper.  \n \n\n   \n \n2 \n The Central Digital & Data Office  (CDDO),  published the Generative AI Framework at the \nbeginning of 2024 to support both decision makers and implementation teams as they examine \nAI and conduct their proof of concepts , potentially leading to scaled adoption in a safe, secure \nand ethical manner . CDDO also worked with Treasury to develop assessment criteria for the \nspending review that help ed departments  to create bids that meet their AI adoption strategies.  \nIts AI and Automation team has continued to work with i.AI (the government’s AI incubator) and \ndepartmental colleagues across government to manage the community of practice and help \ndraft a future update of the Generative AI Framework.  \n \nThe government will soon publish its plan to support  further the effective, safe and ethical \nadoption of AI that will dramatically increase the efficiency of public service delivery and \ncontribute to the government’s  five missions in the new year.  \n \nBuilding public trust  \n \nTransparency is a key driver of responsible innovation and improved public trust in \ngovernments’ use of data and algorithms . It is also one of the core  data protection principle s, \nalong with  other principles such as  fairness  and accountability  which apply  to all processing of \npersonal data, including in AI systems, and must be adhered to by public and private sector \norganisations.  \n  \nThe Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard ( ATRS ) delivers this transparency  by \nestablishing a standardised way for public sector organisations to publish information about \nhow and why they are using algorithmic tools in decision -making with impact on members of \nthe public . It enables these organisations to proactively publish details about the algorithmic \ntools they use , including  the associated  risks that have been identified and how these have \nbeen mitigated , and the governance mechanisms and safeguards that have  been  put in place . \nThis information  is made freely accessible  to the public on GOV .UK together with contact \ndetails to get in touch with the team responsible  for the tool . \n \nThe ATRS is mandatory for government departments and ALBs, for algorithmic tools which \nhave a significant influence on a decision -making process with public effect  or directly interact \nwith the public . This policy mandate is currently being implemented , and we have just added 14 \nnew records to the online repository. M any m ore records will be added over the coming \nmonths.  \n \nThere ar e also specific safeguards set out in the UK’s data protection framework where \nindividuals have been subject to solely automated decision -making (ADM) with a legal or \nsimilarly significant effect on individuals , to ensure that they are aware of, understand, and can \nchallenge  such decisions  if needed. T hese rules apply to public and private sector \norganisations alike . \n \nUK GDPR already require s organisations to provide data subjects with privacy information \nabout the existence of solely automated decision -making, including profiling, meaningful \ninformation about the logic involved, and the significance and envisaged consequences of such \nautomate d processing for the individual  \n   \n \n3 \n  \nFollowing a significant decision based solely on automated processing, the safeguards in  \nArticle 22 of the  UK GDPR apply. These safeguards include notifying data subjects of \ndecisions and providing information on the solely ADM that has been carried out, and the right \nto contest those decisions and to obtain human intervention.  Human intervention should be \ncarried out competently and by a person with the authority to correct a wrongful outcome . This \nwould ensure that under such circumstances, organisations  can review the decisions in \nquestion and  take suitable measures to correct them if they have produced a wrongful \noutcome.  Existing guidance by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) seeks to assist \nindividuals with exercising their rights in relation to solely automated processing .  \nAs you are  aware, the government has introduced reforms to this provision under the Data \n(Use and Access) Bill to allow for the responsible deployment of solely automated decision -\nmaking, and I look forward to continuing our discussions on this topic during the upcoming \nReport stage.  \n \nYours sincerely,  \n \n \n \nBaroness Jones  of Whitchurch  \nMinister for the Future Digital Economy and Online Safety",

falling  any further, \nor \n(ii) take the action  set out in subsection  (2). \n(2) The action  is to— \n(a) \n30transfer  the specified  amount,  or the amount  in the account  if that is \nless than  the specified  amount,  from  the account  into a different \naccount  (a “hold  account”)  created  by the bank  for the sole purpose \nof holding  that transferred  amount,  and \n(b) secure

(1) cease  to apply  when— \n(a) \n5in relation  to a first notice,  a notice  is given  to the bank  under  section \n21(8)) (notice  of decision  not to make  a direct  deduction  order),  or a \ndirect  deduction  order  is given  to the bank  under  section  17; \n(b) in relation  to a direct  deduction  order— \n(i) all the deductions  under  the order  have  been  made,  or \n(ii) the

\n(b) \n20if the other  account  is a joint  account,  each  of the other  account  holders \nconsents. \n(8) Where  a direct  deduction  order  is varied  under  subsection  (7)— \n(a) if the order  is varied  so that it applies  to an account  provided  by \nanother  bank— \n(i) \n25the reference  in subsection  (5) to “the bank”  is to the bank \nwhich  provides  that account, \n(ii) section  23(5) applies  to the order  as varied  as it applied  to the \noriginal  order,  and \n(iii) the Minister  must  notify  the bank  given  the original  order  of \nthe effect  of the variation,  and

(apart  from  this sub-paragraph)  required  to make  the deduction— (1) \n(a) no deduction  is to be made,  and \n(b) the bank  must  notify  the Secretary  of State  as soon  as possible. \n(2) Where  the amount  in an account  is lower  than  the amount  to be deducted \n25in accordance  with  a regular  direct  deduction  order  at the time  that the \nbank  is (apart  from  this sub-paragraph)  required  to make  the deduction— \n(a) the order  is to be read  as requiring  the deduction  and payment  to \nthe Secretary  of State  to take place  on the same  day the following \nweek,  and \n(b) \n30if, on that day,  the amount  in the account  is lower  than  the amount \nto be deducted  in accordance  with  the order— \n(i) no deduction  is to be made,  and \n(ii) the bank  must  notify  the Secretary  of State  as soon  as \npossible. \n(3) \n35References  in this paragraph  to the amount  to be deducted  in accordance \nwith  a direct  deduction  order  include

account  falling  below  the specified  amount \nor, if the amount  in the account  is already  below  that \namount,  falling  any further,  or \n20 (ii) take the action  set out in sub-paragraph  (2). \n(2) The action  is to— \n(a) transfer  the specified  amount,  or the amount  in the account  if that \nis less than  the specified  amount,  from  the account  into a different \n25account  (a “hold  account”)  created  by the bank  for the sole purpose \nof holding  that transferred  amount,  and \n(b) secure  that no transaction  takes  place  (except  for any deduction \nunder  the

\na lump  sum  direct  deduction  order,  the order  is to be read  as if it required \ndeductions  to be made  from  the hold  account. \n(4) A bank  must  ensure  that taking  the action  set out in sub-paragraph  (2) \ndoes  not cause  any disadvantage  to the liable  person,  and in the case of a \n35joint  account,  any other  account  holder,  that the liable  person,  and any \nother  account  holder,  would  not have  experienced  if the bank  had instead \nacted  in accordance  with  sub-paragraph  (1)(b)(i). \n(5) The requirements  in sub-paragraph  (1) cease  to apply  when— \n(a) in relation  to a first notice,  a notice  is given  to the bank  under \n40paragraph  5(8) (notice  of decision  not to make  a direct  deduction \norder)  or a direct  deduction  order  is

(1) \n(2) An immediate  DWP  disqualification  order  is an order— \n(a) setting  out terms  of repayment  with  which  the liable  person  must \ncomply,  and Public  Authorities  (Fraud,  Error  and Recovery)  Bill 112 \nSchedule  6—Disqualification  from  driving \n(b) disqualifying  the liable  person  from  holding  or obtaining  a driving \nlicence  for such  period  as the court  considers  likely  to result  in the \nperson  paying  the recoverable  amount  to the Secretary  of State \n(3) \n5Subject  to sub-paragraph  (5), if the court  is satisfied  on the balance  of \nprobabilities  that the liable  person  has failed,  without  reasonable  excuse, \nto comply  with  terms  of repayment  in a suspended  DWP  disqualification \norder,  the court  must  make  an immediate  DWP  disqualification  order  on \nan application  under  sub-paragraph  (1). \n(4) \n10The period  mentioned  in sub-paragraph  (2)(b) may  not be longer  than  2 \nyears  beginning  with  the day on which  the order  is made. \n(5) The court  may  not make  an immediate  DWP  disqualification  order  if the \ncourt  is of the opinion  that the liable  person— \n(a) needs  a driving  licence  to earn  a living,  or \n(b) has another  essential  need  for a driving  licence. \n15 (6) Where  the terms  of repayment  provide  for repayment  in instalments,  the \nfailure  to pay a single  instalment  is not to be regarded  as a failure  to comply \nwith  the terms  unless  the liable  person  fails to repay  the entire  recoverable \namount  by the time  the final  instalment  is due. \n(7) \n20The Secretary  of State  may  apply  for more  than  one immediate  DWP \ndisqualification  order  in relation  to the same  suspended  DWP \ndisqualification  order. \n(8) Before  determining  an application  under  this paragraph  the court  must \ngive the Secretary  of State  and the liable  person  an opportunity  to be heard. \nTerms  of repayment \n25 3 The court  must  be satisfied  that the terms  of repayment  set out in a \nsuspended  or immediate  DWP  disqualification  order  are ones  with  which \nthe liable  person  has the means  to comply. \nVariation  and revocation  of orders \n4 \n30On an application  by the liable  person  or the Secretary  of State,  the court \nmay,  where  some  of the recoverable  amount  to which  a suspended  or (1) \nimmediate  DWP  disqualification  order  relates  has been  recovered,  make \nan order  varying,  or revoking,  a suspended  or immediate  DWP \ndisqualification  order. \n(2) \n35But the court  may  revoke  a suspended  or immediate  DWP  disqualification \norder  in reliance  on sub-paragraph  (1) only  where  the court  considers  that \nrevoking  the order  will increase  the likelihood  of the remainder  of the \nrecoverable  amount  being  recovered. \n(3) When  considering  an application  under  sub-paragraph  (1), the court  must \ninvite  representations  from— \n40 (a) the Secretary  of State,  where  the application  was made  by the liable \nperson,  and 113 Public  Authorities  (Fraud,  Error  and Recovery)  Bill \nSchedule  6—Disqualification  from  driving \n(b) the liable  person,  where  the application  was made  by the Secretary \nof State, \nor give  both  the Secretary  of State  and the liable  person  an opportunity  to \nbe heard. \n5 (4) The court  may  vary  or revoke  a suspended  or immediate  DWP \ndisqualification  order  on an application  from  the liable  person  where— \n(a) the order  was made  without  the liable  person  being  heard  despite \nbeing  given  an opportunity  to be heard  under  paragraph  1(9), and \n(b) \n10the court  considers  that the liable  person  had a good  reason  for not \ntaking  advantage  of the opportunity  to be heard. \n(5) An application  under  sub-paragraph  (4) must  be made  within  the period \nof 21 days  beginning  with  the day after  the day on which  the liable  person \nis given  notice  that the order  has been  made. \n(6) \n15Before  determining  an application  under  this paragraph,  the court  must \ngive the Secretary  of State  and the liable  person  an opportunity  to be heard. \n(7) Where  the Secretary  of State  has recovered  the whole  of the recoverable \namount  and the costs  mentioned  in paragraph  1(5) from  a liable  person \nsubject  to an immediate  DWP  disqualification  order— \n(a) the Secretary  of State  must  notify  the court,  and \n20 (b) a court  officer  must  make  an order  (without  a hearing)  revoking \nthe immediate  DWP  disqualification  order. \n(8) In this paragraph,  references  to varying  a suspended  or immediate  DWP \ndisqualification  order  includes  varying  the terms  of repayment  set out in \nthe order. \n25 (9) In sub-paragraph  (7)(b), “court  officer”  means  a member  of the staff  of the \ncourt  authorised  by the court  for the purposes  of that sub-paragraph. \nHolding  of driving  licence  for period  of disqualification \n5 Where  the court  makes  an immediate  DWP  disqualification  order,  the \ncourt— \n30 (a) may  require  the liable  person  to whom  the order  relates  to give  to \nthe court  by, or on, a specified  date  any driving  licence  which  the \nliable  person  holds,  and \n(b) must  transfer  each  driving  licence  received  in accordance  with \nparagraph  (a) to the Secretary  of State. \n35 Appeals \n6 The liable  person  or the Secretary  of State  may  appeal  to the appropriate \nappellate  court  on a point  of law against— (1) \n(a) a decision  to, or not to, make,  vary  or revoke  a DWP  disqualification \norder; \n40 (b) the terms  of a DWP  disqualification  order. Public  Authorities  (Fraud,  Error  and Recovery)  Bill 114 \nSchedule  6—Disqualification  from  driving \n(2) An appeal  under  this paragraph  must  be made  within  the period  of 21 \ndays  beginning  with  the day after  the day on which  notice  of the decision \nto which  it relates  is given. \n(3) On an appeal  under  this paragraph,  the appropriate  appellate  court  may— \n5 (a) where  the appeal  relates  to a DWP  disqualification  order  that has \nbeen  made— \n(i) dismiss  the appeal, \n(ii) vary  the order  in any way  that would  have  been  available \nto the court  that made  it, or \n10 (iii) revoke  the order,  or \n(b) where  the appeal  is against  a decision  not to make  a DWP \ndisqualification  order— \n(i) dismiss  the appeal,  or \n(ii) \n15make  a DWP  disqualification  order  that the court  could  have \nmade. \n(4) In this Schedule,  the “appropriate  appellate  court”  means— \n(a) in England  and Wales,  the Crown  Court,  and \n(b) in Scotland,  the Sheriff  Appeal  Court. \nDWP  disqualification  orders:  further  provision \n20 7 A court  must  give  the Secretary  of State  and the liable  person  notice  if— (1) \n(a) it makes  or refuses  to make  a suspended  or immediate  DWP \ndisqualification  order, \n(b) it makes  or refuses  to make  an order  under  paragraph  4, or \n(c) \n25it allows  an appeal  against  a suspended  or immediate  DWP \ndisqualification  order. \n(2) Notice  under  this paragraph  is to be given  to the Secretary  of State  in such \nmanner  and to such  addresses,  and to contain  such  particulars,  as the \nSecretary  of State  may  require. \n(3) \n30The court  may  grant  permission  for an application  or an appeal  after  the \nperiods  mentioned  in paragraphs  4(5) and 6(2) (as the case may  be) where \nsatisfied  that there  is a compelling  reason  to do so. \n(4) Regulations  may  make  provision  for the purposes  of enabling  the court  to \nassess  the matters  mentioned  in paragraphs  1(6), 2(5) and 3. \n(5) \n35In this paragraph,  the reference  to “a court”  is to “the court”  and “the \nappropriate  appellate  court”. \nInformation  sharing \n8 A public  authority  that holds  information  about  a liable  person’s  driving \nlicence  may,  on a request  by the Secretary  of State,  disclose  that information \n40to the Secretary  of State  for the purpose  of facilitating  the exercise  of the \nSecretary  of State’s  functions  under  this Schedule. 115 Public  Authorities  (Fraud,  Error  and Recovery)  Bill \nSchedule  6—Disqualification  from  driving \nNorthern  Ireland  licences \n9 Section  109(1)  of the Road  Traffic  Act 1988  (Northern  Ireland  licences)  has \neffect  subject  to any provision  made  by or under  this Schedule.

This Bill would require the Treasury  to lay draft regulations before \nParliament on  or before 1st April 2019. The Bill makes provisi on to enable any restrictions \nintroduced under the first such regulations to apply retrospectively to exit payments made on \nor after  1 April 2018.  \nPolicy background  \n3  The 2015  Conservative Party manifesto proposed a  limit on exit paym ents for public sector  \nworkers.  On 23  May 2015 the Treasury issued a p ress release in support of the inclusion in the \nEnterprise Bill of a measure to implement that policy . The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury  \nsaid “ We are delivering our manifesto commitment to end six figure pay offs for the best paid \npublic sector workers ” and that “These reforms will ensure fairness and value for  money \nacross the public sector” .  \n4  Section 41 of the Enterprise Act inserted into the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment \nAct 2015 new sections 153A to 153C and gave effect to Schedule 6 of the Enterprise Act 2016 \nwhich contained consequential and supplementary provisions.  This Bill is being brought \nforward to require the Government to introduce draft r egulations to limit public sector ex it \npayments, which it has the power to make  but has not yet done so.  \n5  On 27 June 2017 , Sir Christopher Chope MP  asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer “ When the \nGovernment plans to bring forward secondary legislation to implement the policy of \nprohibiting ex it payments for public sector employees in England exceeding £95,000; and \nwhat steps he is taking to discoura ge such payments in the interim” (Question 1447) . The \nanswer from the new Chief Secretary  to the Treasury,  of 6th July 2017 , was “The Government \nannounced in 2015 that it intended to end six figure exit payments for public sector workers.  \nWe legislated for a £95,000 cap in the Enterprise Act 2016 and are currently in the process of \ndrafting the necessary regulations.  In the interim the Government exp ects every part of the \npublic sector to demonstrate that it is using public money efficiently and responsibly and to \nensure that pay and terms are always proportionate, justifiable and deliver value f or money \nfor tax payers” .  \n6  This Bill was presented to the House of Commons on 5 September 2017 in order to help \nmaintain pressure on the Government to implement exit payment limits . In a further question \non 29 November 2017 to the Treasury (Question 116646) Sir Christopher Chope MP  enquired \nabout the time table  to bring forward the secondary legislation.  In a response dated 4 \nDecember 2017 , the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that before laying the necessary \nregulations and to ensure the successful i mplementation of these changes “ We will bring \nforward a co nsultation in the first quarter of 2018 which will run for twelve weeks” .  \n7  On 26 February 2018 the Sir Christopher Chope MP  asked , in Question 129888 , about the \nplans for the launch of the consultation . The response from the Chief Secretary to the \nTreasury , dated 1 March 2018 , was “ To ensure the successful implementation of these changes \na consultation will be brought  forward in the next few months” . \n8  On 23 May 2018, Sir Christopher Chope MP  asked further questions regarding  when the \nprocess of drafting the regulations began and when the drafting was forecast to be completed.  \n \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the Public Sector Exit Payments (Limitation)  Bill as introduced in the House of \nCommons  on 5 September 2017  (Bill 28)  \n3 \n3 He also enquired as to the reasons why the consultation was not carried out in the first \nquarter of 2018.  In a response dated 4 June 2018 , the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said “ The \nGovernment remains committed to ending six figure pay outs in the public sector.  The \nregulations to implement the exit payment cap were drafted as part of the passage of the \nEnterprise Act 2016.  Since that time, they have undergone further iteration and wil l be \ncompleted following the outcome of the consultation and then laid in Parliament.  It is not \npossible to forecast the hours required to reflect the degree of changes which may be made to \nthe draft regulations following the outcome of the consultation, w hich will necessarily depend \non consultees’ views and the Government’s response to that consultation.  The consultation \nwill seek views on the terms of the draft secondary legislation, including the detailed design \nof the exit payment cap and the list of bo dies to which the cap will apply” .  \nTerritorial extent and application  \n9  This Bill applies to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.   \nCommentary on provisions of Bill  \nClause 1 : duty of Treasury to make regulations  \n10  Clause 1 requires the Trea sury to lay before Parliament draft regulations to limit public sector \nexit payments on or before 1 April 2019.  \nClause 2: application of regulation to payments already made  \n11  Clause 2 enables the first regulations to limit exit payments to apply retrospectively to \npayments made on or after 1 April 2018.  \nCommencement  \n12  Clause 3 of the Bill states that its provisions would come into force on the day it is passed.  \nFinancial implications of the Bill  \n13  In a Parliamentary answer on 4 June 2018 (Question 1 47306) the Chief Secretary to the \nTreasury said that from April 2015 to March 2016 there were 1,787 public sector exit payments \nof over £100,000 and 5,439 between £50,000 and £100,000.   \n14  The Government’s impact assessment for the Enterprise Bill 2015 stated  that “Trends in exit \npayments over recent years suggest the cap could result in savings in the low hundreds of \nmillions of pounds over the course of this Parliament. This is about ensuring tax payers get a \nfair deal”.   \n \n \n \nBill 28–EN 57/1 \n PUBLIC SECTOR EXIT P AYMENTS \n(LIMITATION) BILL   \nEXPLANATORY NOTES  \nThese Explanatory Notes relate to the Public Sector Exit Payments (Limitation)  Bill as introduced in \nthe House of Commons  on 5 September 2017  (Bill 28).  \n \n__________________________________________________________  \nOrdered by the House of Commons  to be p rinted, 5 July 2018  \n__________________________________________________________  \n \n© Parliamentary copyright 2018  \n \nThis publication may be reproduced under the terms of the Open Parliament Licence which is \npublished at www.parliament.uk/site -information/copyright  \n \nPUBLISHED BY AUTHORI TY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS",

This report sets out the Committee’s observations in relation to two private \nmembers’ Bills. It has long been, and remains, the Committee’s approach to \napply the same exacting standards of scrutiny to all bills, whether a government \nbill or a private member’s bill. We acknowledge however that those members \nof the House who sponsor private members’ bills, unlike ministers, do not \nhave the support of departmental officials and Parliamentary Counsel in \nthe preparation of their bills. Our comments on private members’ bills are \nframed in the light of that understanding.\n2\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n   REGULATED AND OTHER ACTIVITIES (MANDATORY \nREPORTING OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE) BILL [HL]\n2.   This private member’s Bill, which is expected to have its second reading on \n17 January, imposes a duty (subject to criminal sanction) on the providers \nof a range of education, healthcare and other settings to report to the local \nauthority where they know or reasonably suspect a child in their care to be \nsubject to sexual abuse. The activities which are the subject of the reporting \nduty are listed in the Schedule to the Bill. Clause 2(9) confers a power on \nthe Secretary of State by regulations to amend the Schedule by adding to \nthe activities, or varying or deleting an activity set out in the Schedule. \nDespite being a Henry VIII power,1  the Bill does not make provision for the \nregulations to be made by statutory instrument. There is also no parliamentary \nscrutiny attached to the power. Accordingly, we recommend that, if \nthe Bill proceeds to its further stages, it should be amended so that \nregulations under clause 2(9) are required to be made by statutory \ninstrument subject to the draft affirmative resolution procedure.\n1 A Henry VIII power is a power that allows amendment, repeal or other alteration of the effect of \nprimary legislation.\n3\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n    CROWN ESTATE (WALES) BILL [HL]\n3.   This private member’s Bill makes provision for the transfer to the \nWelsh Ministers, or a person nominated by them, of the Crown Estate \nCommissioners’ functions in Wales.\n4.   Clause 1 of the Bill inserts a new section 52A into the Wales Act 2017 which \nconfers a power on the Treasury to make a scheme transferring all the \nexisting Welsh functions of the Crown Estate Commissioners to the Welsh \nMinisters or a person nominated by the Welsh Ministers. The Treasury may \nonly make a transfer scheme with the agreement of the Welsh Ministers.\n5.   The provisions of section 52A are based on section 90B of the Scotland \nAct 1998 which they to a very large extent replicate, although in the latter \ncase the power relates to the transfer of the Crown Estate Commissioners’ \nexisting Scottish functions to the Scottish Ministers. In both cases, the \npower to make a transfer scheme is subject to parliamentary scrutiny, with \nthe draft affirmative resolution procedure applying. There is however one \nsignificant difference in the scrutiny provisions: whereas section 90B of the \nScotland Act 1998 provides for scrutiny only by both Houses of Parliament, \nsection 52A provides for scrutiny by both Houses and Senedd Cymru.\n6.   We do not consider that scrutiny of the power by Senedd Cymru is \nappropriate. The purpose of the transfer scheme is to set out the terms \non which a reserved matter, namely management of the Crown Estate in \nWales, should be devolved. In this context, the Bill enables the Treasury to \ninclude in the transfer scheme such provision as they consider necessary or \nexpedient in the interests of defence or national security, and also to include \nsuch provision as they consider necessary to ensure that the management \nof the Crown Estate in Wales does not conflict with other reserved maters, \nnamely the exploitation of oil or gas resources. Decisions relating to reserved \nmatters, and the terms on which they should be devolved, are in our view \nappropriately for the UK Government to make subject to scrutiny by the \nUK Parliament, and this is reflected in the fact that the power to make the \nscheme is conferred on the Treasury. It does not seem to us appropriate (or \nconsistent with previous practice) to make powers exercisable solely by UK \nMinisters subject to scrutiny by a devolved legislature.\n7.    Accordingly, we consider that, consistently with the approach for \nScotland under section 90B of the Scotland Act 1998, the powers \nconferred by section 52A of the Wales Act 2017 should be subject to \nscrutiny solely by both Houses of Parliament.\n4\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n    NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS (SECONDARY \nCLASS 1 CONTRIBUTIONS) BILL\n8.   This Bill contains no delegations of legislative power.\n FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  TO UKRAINE BILL\n9.   \nThis Money Bill contains no delegations of legislative power.\n5\n DELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nAP PENDIX  1:    MEMBERS’ INTERESTS\n   Committee Members’ registered interests may be examined in the online Register \nof Lords’ Interests at https://www.parliament.uk/hlregister . The Register may also \nbe inspected in the Parliamentary Archives.\n  For the business taken at the meeting on 08 January 2025, Members declared no \ninterests. \n  Attendance\n  The meeting was attended by Lord McLoughlin, Lord Goodman of Wycombe, \nBaroness Bakewell of Hardington Mandeville, Lord Carlile or Berriew, The Earl of Lindsay, Lord Rooker and Baroness Finlay of Llandaff.",

    "event_name": "Renters' Rights Bill",
    "blurb": "The Renters' Rights Bill, introduced in September 2024, aims to reform the private rented sector by abolishing no-fault evictions, enhancing tenant protections, and introducing a new landlord redress scheme. Key provisions include ending fixed-term tenancies, regulating rent increases, and enforcing the Decent Homes Standard. The bill seeks to empower tenants and improve housing standards, addressing issues of security, affordability, and discrimination in renting.",
    "body": "1 \n RENTERS’ RIGHTS BILL 2024  \nEUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS MEMORANDUM  \nIntroduction  \n1. The Renters’ Rights Bill (“the Bill”) was introduced in the House of Commons \non W ednesday 11th September 2024. It was introduced in the House of Lords \non Wednesday 15th January, hav ing been amended at both Committee and \nReport stage in the House of Commons.  \n2. The Bill gives effect to commitments made by the government in the  Labour  \nmanifesto published on 13th June 2024. The Bill’s objective is to reform the \nprivate rented sector (PRS ) by abolishing no -fault evictions, strengthening \ntenant protections, preventing tenants  from being exploited and discriminated \nagainst, empowering tenants to challenge unreasonable rent increases and \nraising standards, including extending ‘Awaab’s Law’ to the PRS.   \n3. This memorandum addresses issues arising under the European Convention \non Human Rights (ECHR) in relation to the Bill. It has been prepared by the \nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government  (MHCLG) . This \nECHR memorandum was first published following the Bill’s introduction in the \nHouse of Commons. It has been subsequently updated  to flag any new/notable \nECHR points arising as a result of amendments made during the Bill’s passage \nin the House of Commons.   \nSummary of the Bill  \n4. The Bill consists of 5 Parts:  \nPart 1  \n5. Part 1 reforms the assured and assured shorthold tenancy framework . \nCurrently the assured shorthold tenancy (AST) is the default tenancy in the PRS \n– its defining feature being that a landlord can evict a tenant at the end of a \n \n2 \n fixed term by serving a “section 21 notice”. This does not require the landlord \nto provide a reason  for the eviction . Part 1 (via amendment to the Housing Act \n1988 – HA 1988)  abolishes section 21 notices, and in so doing, the AST  model . \nThe default type of tenancy for the PRS will become the Assured Tenancy (AT).  \n6. Part 1 then makes a number of amendments to the AT framework . These \ninclude:  \na. Removing fixed terms, making assured tenancies periodic only , with rent \nperiods not exceeding one month (Chapter 1);  \nb. Various changes to the grounds of possession in Schedule 2 to the HA \n1988, including what those grounds are, when they can be used, and \nhow much notice must be provided in each case (Chapter 1);  \nc. Changes to the procedure around increasing rent in the tenancy . This \nprovides the only way a landlord will be able to increase the rent is via \nthe statutory process in section 13 to the HA 1988 (C hapter 1);  \nd. Regulating and limiting the circumstances in which a landlord can require \nrent in advance from the tenant (Chapter 1);  \ne. Requiring landlords t o provide a statement of terms and other \ninformation to the tenant at the beginning of the tenancy (Chapter 1);  \nf. Inserting an implied term into AT agreements which provides that where \na tenant requests to keep a pet in accordance with the procedure set \nout, the landlord cannot unreasonably refuse the request. The landlord \ncan require the tenant to take out pet insurance (Chapter 1);  \ng. Making provision for financial penalties where a landlord acts in breach \nof the requirements/prohibitions. Local authorities can impose a civil \nfinancial penalty of up to £7,000 for initial breaches/specified more minor \nbreaches. More serious breaches are punishable by a criminal offence \nor, as an alternative, a civil penalty of up to £40,000 (Chapter 1);  \n \n3 \n h. Providing  that any clause in a guarantor agreement  is unenforceable \ninsofar as it would hold the guarantor liable for rent accruing after the \ndeath of the tenant  (Chapter 1) .  \ni. Amending Schedule 1 to the HA 1988 to ensure fixed term leases of over \n21 years in length cannot be assured tenancies (Chapter 2);  \nj. New measures to tackle rental discrimination in the PRS, which extend \nto Wales and Scotland (Chapters 3 to 5);  \nk. New measures to prohibit the practice of rental bidding (Chapter 6);   \nl. Amending the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 to allow Local Housing \nAuthorities (LHAs) to impose financial penalties for offences under \nsection 1 of that Act  (Chapter 7) ; and  \nm. Extend ing Awaab’s Law to the PRS . Awaab’s Law has been introduced \nin the social rented sector (“SRS”) (see section 42 of the Social Housing \n(Regulation) Act 2023 (“SHRA 2023”)) in response  to the tragic death of \ntwo-year-old Awaab Ishak from a respiratory illness caused by mould in \nhis rented home which the social landlord failed to address in a timely \nfashion. The intention is to take the same approach in the PRS by \namending the Landlord an d Tenant Act 1985 to imply a covenant into \nleases that the landlord must comply with requirements re lating to \nserious hazards as set out in regulations made by the Secretary of State. \nThe requirements involve taking specified action in relation to the hazard \nwithin a specified period (Chapter 7).  \nPart 2  \n7. Part 2 of the Bill provides for new obligations for landlords under assured or \nregulated tenancies. The new obligations relate to (a) the creation of a PRS \nredress scheme(s) to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants out of \ncourt; and (b) a new Priv ate Rented Sector Database (“ the database ”) allowing \ntenants to access information about their landlords, for PRS landlords to better \n \n4 \n understand their responsibilities and for local councils to have access to better \ndata to assist with enforcement action.  \n8. Chapter 2 of Part 2 gives a power to the Secretary of State to make regulations \nwhich require residential landlords to be members of a PRS landlord redress \nscheme approved or designated by the Secretary of State. This will allow \nprospective, current and fo rmer tenants of that landlord to make a complaint to \nthe scheme to be investigated and determined by an independent person. In \naddition:  \na. Regulations may require a prospective landlord to be a member of such \na scheme before the tenancy is marketed, and require a person to \nremain a member of a scheme for a specified period after ceasing to be \na residential landlord . A scheme must meet certain requirements set out \nin regulations to be approved or designated . \nb. LHAs will be responsible for enforcing  the requirement to be a member \nof a landlord redress scheme. For an initial breach of the regulations, a \nfine of up to £7,000 may be imposed. In the worst cases, where a \nlandlord or letting agent persists in breachin g the regulations or does so \nrepeatedly, they will be guilty of an offence, punishable by a fine or a \nfinancial penalty in lieu of up to £40,000.  \nc. Decisions under a landlord redress scheme may be made enforceable \nas a court order by regulations following consultation (cf. Schedule 2 \nparagraph 7D Housing Act 1996 – “HA 1996”).  \n9. Chapter 3 of Part 2 provides for the establishment and operation of a PRS \ndatabase on which residential landlords will be required to register themselves \nand their rental properties and pay a registration fee before tenancies are \nmarketed and created. A pe rson will be prohibited from marketing a dwelling for \nthe purposes of creating a residential tenancy unless there is an active landlord \nand dwelling entry in the database . LHAs will be required to make entries on \nthe database relating to relevant banning o rders, banning order offences and \n \n5 \n financial penalties for banning order offences1. The Secretary of State  will also \nbe able to make regulations which authorise or require LHAs to make an entry \nin the database in respect of a person who is convicted of an offence, has had \na financial penalty imposed or is subject to regulatory action of a description to \nbe prescribed by the regu lations, provided that the relevant event occurred at \na time when the person was a residential landlord, or marketed the property for \nthe purposes of creating a residential tenancy. Please note that:  \na. Not all of the information on the database will be public, with powers for \nthe Secretary of State to adjust what is public and what is restricted to \nensure that the accessibility of information about criminal offences such \nas banning order offences is neces sary and proportionate. Regulations \nwill also specify requirements to link banning order and banning order \noffence information with landlord and dwelling entries and the time \nperiod for which such information should be made publicly available.  \nb. Mayoral combined authorities (“MCAs”), the GLA, lead enforcement \nauthorities, LHAs and local weights and measures authorities will have \naccess to the information in the database to assist with the performance \nof their functions relating to housing and enfo rcement.  \nc. There are powers to make regulations authorising the disclosure of \nrestricted information (information which will not otherwise be publicly \navailable and which relate s to and identif ies a particular person) for the \npurposes of enabling or facilitating compliance with statutory \nrequirements, rules of law and the exercise of statutory functions set out \nin such regulations. Regulations may also specify the manner and form \nin which the infor mation is to be disclosed and may also impose \nrestrictions on the use a nd onward disclosure of the information. There \nis also provision that disclosure in accordance with the regulations  will \n \n1 A banning order is an order by the First Tier Tribunal which , among other things, ban s a person from \nletting housing in England.  A banning order offence is an offence listed in regulations made under \nsection 14(3) of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 or described in section 12 of the Tenant Fees Act \n2019.  If a person has been convicted of a banning order offence, a local housing authority may apply \nfor a banning order against that person. For further information , see Chapter 2 , Part 2 of the 2016 \nAct.  \n \n \n6 \n not breach any obligations of confidentiality owed by the database \noperator, or any other restrictions on disclosure that may apply. However, \nany disclosure that would breach data protection legislation is not \nauthorised. Disclosure of unauthorised restricted information or onward \ndisclosure of such information is to be a summary offence punishable by \nway of a fine.  \n10. Provision is made for entries to be kept up to date and for verification, correction \nand deletion of the information in the database. Provision is made for the \npublication of advice and information in respect of landlord and tenant rights. \nProvision is mad e for enforcement of the requirements of Part 2 Chapter 3 of \nthe Bill by LHAs. This includes provision for fines of up to £7,000 for certain \nbreaches,  and up to £40,000 where a  criminal offence  has been committed . \nPart 3  \n11. Part 3 introduces the Decent Homes Standard (DHS) into the PRS by making \namendments to Part 1 of the Housing Act 2004 (“HA 2004”). It creates a power \nfor the Secretary of State to set requirements  in regulations  for the minimum \nstandards that properties in the PRS must meet. The amendments adopt and \nadd to the enforcement mechanisms in the HA 2004 where properties fail to \nmeet the new requirements.  \nPart 4  \n12. Part 4 creates a power for the Secretary of State to make arrangements for a \nlead enforcement authority in relation to measures in the Bill  and the AT \nframework.  The role of the lead enforcement authority will include monitoring \nthe operation of the legislation, providing guidance and support to local \nauthorities and the public and, where necessary, stepping into the shoes of \nLHAs to take enforcement action itself .  \n13. Part 4 also makes further provision about the enforcement of measures in the \nBill. In particular it makes provision to ensure that where appropriate  superior \nlandlord s and officers of corporat e bodies  can be made subject to a rent \n \n7 \n repayment order (RRO) (see Chapter 4, Part 2 of the Housing and Planning Act \n2016) , including by ensuring that superior landlords can be held liable for \ncertain RRO offences .   \n14. Part 4 also  provides  a number of investigatory powers to LHAs to ensure they \ncan enforce measures effectively and robustly.  \nPart 5  \n15. Part 5 deals with consequential amendments, territorial extent, commencement \nand tra nsitional provision .  \nSummary of the government’s ECHR analysis  \n16. The provisions of the Bill engage the following Convention rights:  \na. Article 1 Protocol 1  – this right provides that persons (both natural and legal) \nhave the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions. A1P1 is \nengaged by Parts 1 -5 of the Bill.  \nb. Article 8  – this right provides that persons have the right to respect for their \nhome and private life. Article 8 is engaged by Part s 2 and 4 of the Bill.  \nc. Article 6  – this right provides that in the determination of a person’s civil \nrights and obligations everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within \na reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by \nlaw. Article 6 is engaged by Part 2 and  by Part 4 of the Bill.  \n17. As set out on page 167 of the explanatory notes to the Bill, the Secretary of \nState for Housing, Communities and Local Government is of the view that the \nprovisions of the Bill are compatible with Convention Rights.  As such she has \nmade a statement under section 19(1)(a) of the H uman Rights Act 1998.  \n \n8 \n 18.  All enabling powers in this Bill are capable of being exercised in a way that is \ncompatible with Convention rights and the Secretary of State is required to act \ncompatibly with Convention rights when making secondary legislation.  \nECHR analysis by measure  \n19.

There is a broad legitimate aim which underlies most of the measures in the Bill  \n(this is referred back to in this ECHR memo as the “ general legitimate aim”) . \nThis relates to the current state of the PRS and the critical need for urgent \nreform. As th e general  legitimate aim is frequently referred to for a number of \nmeasures in the Bill, the government has set it out here in detail. Where there \nare particular nuances in the legitimate aim for a particular measure, this is set \nout separately below.  \nSize of the PRS  \n21. The PRS has doubled in size since 2002  and is now the second largest housing \ntenure. 4.6 million households rent privately, which is equivalent to 11 million \npeople and 19% of the housing market, This compares to 65% of households \nin the owner -occupied sector and 16% in social housing.i  Whilst the PRS is still \nan important home for young professionals  and students seeking flexibility, over \n30% of the households in the sector have children present and a significant \nnumber of older people (aged 65 -75) live in the PRS.  \nThe problem with security  \n22. Compared to other forms of housing (home ownership and social housing) the \nprivate rented sector offers the lowest amount of security to the tenant. This is \ndue to the landlord’s ability to issue a section 21 notice at the end of the fixed \nterm (or in acco rdance with a break clause in the tenancy agreement). This \nallows the landlord to evict the tenant with no reason and with only 2 months’ \n \n9 \n notice.  In 2022 -2023 30% of renters who moved in the past three years did not \nend their previous tenancy by choice2. Furthermore, the threat of a section 21 \nnotice is also a reason many households put up with poor conditions or poor \nlandlord behaviour. Research by Citizens Advice in 2018 showed that those \nwho receive a section 21 notice are five times more likely to have recently made \na complaint to their council than those who have not3. Further, half of tenants \nwho live in poor quality housing do not complain to their landlord because they \nare scared of eviction. 4 \n23. The use of section 21 notices is also a major cause of homelessness. Between \nJanuary and March 2024, 6630 households were threatened with \nhomelessness due to a section 21 notice. As well as the impact this has for \ntenants, this also places significant pressures on local councils who have legal \nduties to act where a person is under threat of homelessness. The tenancy \nreform measures in Part 1 of the Bill (the repeal of section 21 of the 1988 \nAct and the corresponding reform of the Schedule 2 grounds for \nposse ssion) are chiefly concerned with addressing this problem of \nsecurity for tenants.  \nThe problem with rent/affordability  \n24. The last two years have seen unprecedented levels of growth in rental \nprices . Whilst the annual growth rate in rents have usually been around 2%, in \nMarch 2024 the yearly increase in the average rent of the stock of private \ntenancies reached 9%,5 the highest level since records began in 2015. Where \ndemand has outstripped supply, market rents have increased, which has driven \npractices such as tenants being pitted against each other in bidding wars.  The \naffordability of rent problem has been a major issue flagged with  MHCLG , \nparticularly from families and single people who are increasingly having \ndifficulty keeping up with their rent payments.  The amendments the Bill is \n \n2 MHCLG analysis of the English Housing Survey 2022 -23. \n3 Touch and go: How to protect private renters from retaliatory eviction in England’, Citizens Advice \n2018.  \n4 Damp, cold and full of mould: The reality of housing in the private rented sector, Citizens Advice \nreport, February 2023  \n5 ONS 2024, Private rent and house prices, UK - Office for National Statistics (ons.gov.uk) .  \n \n10 \n making around the process by which landlords can raise the rent during \na tenancy is chiefly concerned with addressing this affordability problem.  \n25. In addition to this, 44% of landlords are reportedly unwilling to let to tenants \nwho receive housing support or Universal credit. 15% are also unwilling to let \nto families with children6. This again compounds the affordability crisis as it \ncreates a supply and demand problem in the market often for more vulnerable \ntenants. The rental discrimination measures in  Part 1 of  the Bill are aimed \nat addressing these practices.  \nThe problem with quality and standards  \n26. Housing quality in the PRS is the lowest across all the tenures. In 2022 -2023, \n21% of PRS homes fail to meet the decent homes standard as applied in the \nsocial housing sector7. This situation has led to 70% of PRS tenants having \nexperienced cold, damp or mould8, and 1.6 million children are reportedly \nstruggling with damp, mould or excessive cold in their home9. The Decent \nHomes Standard is currently enforceable in the social housing sector and \nprovisions in the Bill seek to make it enforceable in the PRS, where at the \nmoment it takes the form of non -statutory guidance.  \n27. As well as the serious (sometimes lethal) consequences of this for tenants, \nMHCLG figures estimate a total cost of £ 340 million a year to the NHS due to \nhazardous conditions in the PRS10. The measure s in Part 1 and Part 3 of the \nBill applying the Decent Homes Sta ndard in the PRS  and Awaab’s law are \nboth designed to combat this issue.  \nThe problem with unequal bargaining power for tenants  \n \n6 English Private Landlord Survey 2021 and English Housing Survey.   \n7 English Housing Survey 2022 to 2023  \n8 Citizens Advice  \n9 Coley, Rebekah Levine, et al. “Poor quality housing is tied to children’s emotional and behavioural \nproblems.” Policy Research Brief, MacArthur foundation, September 2013.  \n10 House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts: Regulation of private renting, April 2022.  \n \n \n11 \n 28. The situation set out above, particularly the ability of a landlord to evict a tenant \nby issuing a section 21 notice, all combine to create a situation where tenants \nhave very little bargaining power in relation to their tenancy agreement. At the \nmoment th e main route for PRS tenants to seek relief in the event a landlord \nfails to meet his obligations under the tenancy agreement or regulatory \nobligations is by recourse to the courts. This process can often prove to be \nstressful, lengthy and costly to tenant s and acts as a barrier (particularly for the \nmost vulnerable) in getting their dispute resolved.  The PRS is falling behind \nother housing tenures and consumer sectors, such as finance, legal, energy \nand the communications industry, where redress is the norm. The requirement \nfor landlords to become members of a redress scheme  in Part 2  is \ndesigned to address this issue.  \nThe problem of enforcement  \n29. Variation in enforcement of existing standards across England can also leave \ntenants and landlords frustrated and allow criminal operators to thrive. \nResearch by Sheffield Hallam University found that most councils operate a \nlargely reactive service with significant variation in the extent to which \nenforcement tools and powers are used. Reasons for this include low political \nbacking, lack of data, and levels of capacity and capability.11  \n30. Backing this, a National Audit Office (NAO) report in 2021 found that there was \na wide range of approaches across the country, with some councils inspecting \nalmost no properties, while others inspected a large proportion. The same \nreport found low use of s ome regulatory tools such as Banning Orders and \npenalty notices, with only 10 landlords and letting agents banned since new \npowers were introduced in 2016. Similarly, in 2024, the N ational Residential \nLandlords Association  reported that just over half of councils had used new Civil \nPenalties introduced in 2017 between 2021 and 2023 with over 60% of all civil \npenalties issued by only 20 ‘super -user’ councils.12 Councils sought to tackle \n \n11 Council enforcement in the Private Rented Sector: headline report, June 2022.  \n12 The Enforcement Lottery: Local authority enforcement 2021 -2023, NRLA Research Observatory, \n2024.  \n \n12 \n the most serious Category 1 hazards in only approximately 2.5% of properties \nestimated to contain those in 2019.  \n31. Councils’ ability to target rogue landlords is also hampered by a lack of robust \ndata and information on the sector. Unlike in Scotland and Wales, there is no \nnational database of PRS landlords. Instead, there is a ‘patchwork of schemes’ . \nA 2021 report by the Centre for Public Data found that just 7.4% of the PRS in \nEngland are covered by registration or licensing requirements.13 As a result, the \nmajority of councils underestimate the size of their area’s PRS. In the absence \nof a national database, trying to identify PRS properties and pursue criminal \nlandlords can take councils a considerable amount of time.  \n32. The measures in Part 2 of the Bill which provide for a new landlord \nDatabase, alongside the investigatory powers in the Bill (Part 4 ), are \ndesigned to better enable local housing authorities to investigate and \nenforce regulatory requirements against landlords.  \nPart 1 , Chapter 1  of the Bill  - Tenancy Reform   \nECHR right engaged: A1P1  \n33. The following tenancy reform provisions engage A1P1:  \na. Abolition of s.21 notices, ASTs  and fixed -term tenancies and the introduction \nof monthly rent periods.  \nb. Amendments to the Schedule 2 possession grounds in the HA 1988;  \nc. Amendments to the statutory procedure for increasing rent;  \nd. A new duty on landlords to provide tenants with a written statement of terms \nand  \n \n13 A national  landlord register for England: how to make it work, The Centre for Public Data, October \n2021.  \n \n13 \n e. A new right for a tenant to request to keep a pet in their rented property.  \nf. A provision that renders unenforceable a clause in a guarantor agreement \ninsofar as it would hold the guarantor liable for rent accruing after the death \nof the tenant.  \nInterference  \n34. The government’s view is  that the tenancy reform measures engage and \nconstitute an interference with a landlord’s A1P1 rights as they regulate the way \nin which the landlord manages a tenancy and how they can bring it to an end. \nFor example, t he abolition of the landlord’s ability to evict a tenant without \ncause, alongside the general repeal of ASTs , will to a certain extent make it \nmore difficult for a landlord to evict a tenant as they will now have to establish \na particular possession ground . Similarly, the removal of fixed terms  and move \nto periodic rent periods of no more than 1 month constitute an interference in \nhow the landlord manages their property. The way in which a landlord can raise \nthe rent during a tenan cy is also changing , limiting the landlord’s ability to raise \nthe rent to the formal statutory process in section  13 of the HA 1988 .Landlords \nwill no longer be able to use rent review clauses in tenancy agreements , nor \nwill they be able to require rent in advance save for the first month’s rent which \nthey will still be allowed to require/accept between the tenancy being entered \ninto and the tenant taking possession ). The Bill places more duties on landlords \nto provide tenants with a written statement of terms and new duties when faced \nwith a request f rom a tenant for a pet.  The provision which renders a clause in \na guarantor agreement unenforceable insofar as it holds a guarantor liable for \nrent accruing after the death of the tenant will make it more difficult for a landlord \nto recover rent accruing after the death  of the tenant.  All of these constitute an \ninterference in how a landlord manages their property.   \nJustification  \n35. The government considers  all of  these  interferences with A1P1 rights to \nconstitute a “control of use” rather than depriving a landlord of their property \nrights or asset. There is existing analogous caselaw which has found other \n \n14 \n regulatory action in relation to housing to amount to control of use  (Immobiliare \nSaffi v Italy  – concerned legal limitations on level of rent property owners could \ndemand ; Lindheim and Others v Norway – concerned the loss of certain \nexclusive rights over land; Democracy and Human Rights Resource Centre and \nMustafayev v Azerbaijan  – imposed positive obligations on landowner ). \n36. All of the interferences set out above are in pursuit of the general legitimate aim \nset out in detail above, in particular dealing with the problem of security and the \nproblem of rent/affordability for tenants renting in the private rented sector. The \nremoval of fixed terms in particular also address es the risk of tenants being \nlocked in to propertie s even in circumstances where, for example , those \nproperties  fail to meet quality standards . The measures  also address  the point \nthat due to the growth in size of the PRS, for many tenants, the private rented \nsector is their permanent home and a person’s home should support their \nwellbeing.  The legitimate aim underlying the pets measure in particular is that \nowning a pet is critical to many people ’s well-being  – both mental and physical. \nThere are a growing number of single people and older people living in the PRS \nwho may depend on a pet for companionship. The provision relating to \nguarantor agreements has the legitimate aim of  preventing unscrupulous \nlandlords from deliberately not ending a tenancy following the tenant’s death, \ninstead seeking to pursue a grieving guarantor for , what could be, months of \naccruing rent.  \n37.  The government considers all of the tenancy reform measures to be \nproportionate in meeting the general legitimate aim. The Bill reforms the \npossession grounds in Schedule 2 to the HA 1988  to ensure they are fit for \npurpose  and carefully balance the interests of landlords and tenants, enabl ing \nthe landlord to regain possession in various circumstances  where appropriate . \nThis includes social landlords and charities to ensure they can regain \npossession to manag e their housing stock  effectively  and to pursue their \ncharitable aims.   Moving to a system in which a landlord must establish a reason \nfor eviction , in conjunction with the reforms to the possession grounds,  does \nnot create a disproportionate or excessive burden on landlords. Similarly , the \nremoval of fixed terms has been balanced with an increase in the notice period \na tenant must provide to the landlord where they wish to serve a notice to quit. \n \n15 \n A landlord will still be able to raise the rent during the tenancy but now must do \nso using the formal statutory process set out in section 13 of the HA 1988 .  The \ngovernment considers the Bill achieves the general legitimate aim of regulating \nthe rent increase process in a proportionate way which protects the interests of \ntenant whilst ensur ing landlords can continue to derive value from their asset. \nIn relation to pets, it will still be possible for a landlord to refuse a tenant’s \nrequest for a pet where it is reasonable to do so , and where  a landlord  does \nconsent, the Bill allows the landlord to require the tenant to obtain insurance \nagainst pet damag e or pay the reasonable costs of the landlord procuring such \ninsurance.  Finally, the removal of a guarantor’s liability for rent accruing after \na tenant’s death is proportionate to its ai m;  there are alternative ways in which \na landlord can mitigate their losses in this scenario. Further, the provision is \nclear it only applies to guarantors wh o are individuals (not corporate guarantors) \nand, in the case of a joint tenancy in which a tenant has died, the guarantor \nmust be related to the dead tenant to be absolved of liability for rent accruing \nafter the tenant’s death.  \nPart 1 , Chapter s 3-5: Rental Discrimination  \nECHR Right engaged: A1P1  \nInterference   \n38. Prohibiting landlords and letting agents from discriminating against individuals \nwith children or those in receipt of benefits engages landlords’ A1P1 rights. The \nmeasure  regulate s how a landlord goes about letting the dwelling and  \ntherefore, it could be argued,  amount s to a control of use of the property.  \nJustification  \n39. The rental discrimination measure is in pursuit of the general legitimate aim set \nout above, in particular in addressing the affordability issues persisting in the \nprivate rented sector explained in paragraph 23 above.   The government  is of \nthe view that it is unacceptable for landlords to refuse to consider someone as \na prospective tenant, or refuse to let to them , simply because  they are in receipt \n \n16 \n of benefits or have children. The government  believes that everyone should \nhave access to safe and secure housing, regardless of whether they are in \nreceipt of benefits or their family circumstances.  \n40. The government’ s view is that the interference is proportionate given the \nimportance of these objectives. The proposals strike a fair balance between \nensuring low -income tenants and tenants with children are able to secure \naccommodation in the PRS whilst mitigating any potential burden or  adverse \nimpact on landlords. Whilst the Bill generally prohibit s a landlord from apply ing \na provision, criterion or practice that makes a person who would have a child \nlive with or visit them less likely to enter into a te nancy compared with someone \nwho would not , this is still permitted if  provided it is a proportionate means of \nachieving a legitimate aim – this acts as a defence to a proposed breach  . For \nexample the property may not be safe for occupation by a child or the letting \nmay be for the purpose of a retirement community.  \n41. It is necessary to extend the protections to terms in mortgages, insurance \ncontracts, tenancy agreements and terms in superior leases – by making any \nterms requiring a rental discriminatory practices ineffective. Otherwise the \nimportant protections being introduced could be significantly undermined. \nClause 43 allows a landlord to take income into account when considering \nwhether that person would be able to afford to pay the rent under the tenancy \n– the intention behind this clause is to address one of the key reasons landlords \nmay be reluctant to rent to thos e in receipt of benefits – namely affordability \nconcerns . \nPart 1 , Chapter 6 : Rental Bidding  \nECHR right engaged: A1P1  \nInterference  \n42. The rental bidding measure first requires a landlord (or a letting agent acting on \ntheir behalf) to state the specific amount of rent requested in any written \nadvertisement or offer for the tenancy. The provision then prohibits a landlord \n \n17 \n or letting agent from accepting, encouraging or inviting higher bids for rent from \nprospective tenants. Breach of either of these requirements is punishable by \nway of a civil penalty administered by the local housing authority or local \nweights and measures authority. This measure engages a landlord’s A1P1 \nrights as it concerns the way in which they advertise the availability of a tenancy \nin relation to their dwelling. Further, it constitutes an interference as it prevents \nthem from taking certain actions wh ich might lead to a higher rent return . This \namounts to a control of use of the property.   \nJustification  \n43. The objective behind the rental bidding measure is to end an exploitative \npractice in which tenants are pitted against one another with the consequence \nof driving up rents  – see the general legitimate aim, in particular the problem of \naffordability in the PRS and tacking social injustice . The government  consider s \nit to be proportionate to achieve the aim of outlawing the practice of rental \nbidding. It does not interfere with the rental price stated by the landlord at the \npoint the property is advertised . Further, a landlord will be able to raise the rent \nduring the tenancy using the statutory procedure under  section 13  of the HA \n1988 .  \nPart 1 , Chapter 7 : Awaab ’s Law  \nECHR Right engaged: A1P1  \nInterference  \n44. The application of Awaab’s Law to the PRS engages A1P1. Depending on how \nthe regulation -making power is exercised , which will be informed by  prior \nconsultation,  the following aspects of the application of Awaab’s Law to the PRS \nwould arguably interfere with a PRS landlord’s peaceful enjoyment of their \nproperty by controlling the landlord’s use of it:  \na. Landlords having to investigate a potential hazard within a specified period ; \n \n18 \n b. Landlords having to initiate remedial works within a specified period of the \nhazard being confirmed ; \nc. Landlords having to complete the remedial works within a reasonable time ; \nd. Landlords having to carry out emergency remedial works within a specified \nperiod ; \ne. Landlords having to rehouse or compensate tenants where works cannot \nbe carried out within the specified period.  \n45. If landlords fail to comply with requirements such as those above, they will be \nexposed to legal claims by their tenants for injunctive relief and/or damages on \nthe basis of breach of contact. This strengthens the tenant’s position under the \nexisting law b y giving greater certainty as to what should be considered a \nreasonable period of time for landlords to take specified action in order to \naddress serious hazards in rented property . \nJustification  \n46. It is the  government ’s view that any interference with landlords’ A1P1 rights is \nin pursuit of the general l egitimate aim  set out above – in particular  to promote \ntenants’ safety and wellbeing and to ensure that another tragedy like that \nsuffered by Awaab Ishak  and his family  does not happen again.  \n47. The power to make regulations setting out requirements that a landlord will be \nobliged to meet is capable of being exercised in a way that introduces a \nstatutory implied landlord covenant  which is  proportionate  relative to the policy \naim, given the  government ’s wide margin of appreciation in implementing \neconomic and social policies .  \nPart 2 , Chapter 2 : Landlord Redress Scheme  \nECHR right engaged: A1P1 and Article 8 \n \n19 \n 48. The provision for a landlord redress scheme in Part 2 of the Bill is likely to \nconstitute an interference with a landlord’s A1P1 rights . It will control the \nlandlord’s ability to let or market the property by requiring the landlord to first be \na member of the landlord redress scheme. A landlord will also have to pay \nmembership fees and may be required to comply with awards of redress . \nUltimately a landlord may be expelled from a landlord redress scheme if they \nfail to comply with scheme requirements which could then result in the landlord \nbeing unable to let their property. The government consider s any interference \nto constitute a control of use of the landlord’s property.  \n49. The government’s  view is that any interference with A1P1 rights is in pursuit of \nthe general legitimate aim set out above, namely addressing the current \ndisparity in bargaining power between landlords and tenants. A tenant should, \nin line with other types of consumer, be able to seek relief in the event a landlord \nfails to meet their obligations without being forced into a stressful and costly \ncourt process.  The measure is also proportionate  – it is standard practice for \nredress schemes to be funded by way  of membership fees and the forms of \nredress that a scheme will award will be subject to the Secretary of State’s \napproval and will be compensatory, not punitive.  \n50.  It is possible the landlord redress measure will also engage and constitute an \ninterference with a landlord’s Article 8 rights. The Bill requires the redress \nscheme rules to make provision for landlord information (which could include \npersonal information) to be shared with other redress, regulatory and \nenforcement  bodies, as well as the Secretary of State. In addition, the \nrequirement for PRS landlords to be members of a landlord redress scheme \nmeans that such landlords will be obliged to provide personal information to the \nscheme.  The government considers this interference to be justified as it is in \npursuit of a legitimate aim of  monitoring and ensuring the efficacy of the redress \nscheme and to provide the Secretary of State with insight into the PRS. The \ninformation will not be in the public domain and there will be procedural \nsafeguards in place to protect personal data . The data protection principles will \nbe applied which  include  prevent ing data from being held for any purpose other \nthan those provided for by law and in an appropriate  manner.  \n \n20 \n Part 2, Chapter 3 – the PRS Database  \nECHR right  engaged: Article 8  \n51. The PRS database  measure  will engage and interfere in a landlord’s Article 8 \nrights as  it will  requir e landlords to register their personal details and details \nrelating to their property on a public database . In time , this will result in certain \ncriminal offence data  pertaining to a landlord  (relevant banning orders and \nrelevant banning order offences, related financial penalties and possibly other \nrelevant criminal offences) being publicly accessible on the database .  \nJustification  \n52. The policy pursues the legitimate aim of providing tenants access to essential \ninformation relating to the landlord and property that they are renting or \nconsidering renting , prior to entering into a binding tenancy agreement. This is \nto enable them to make an informed decision about whether  to rent from a \nparticular landlord. The objectives of the PRS reform programme are to \ncontribute to a  tenant’s physical health and safety, and also their sense of \nsecurity and feeling comfortable in their home. Part of this is ensuring a tenant \nknows who their landlord/proposed landlord is and if they are subject to an \nunspent criminal conviction . Similarly, a tenant should be able to find out that \nthe landlord of a property the tenant  rents or is proposing to rent has been \nissued with a banning order and therefore is not permitted to let the property or \nhas committed a banning order offence relevant to the landlord/tenant \nrelationship.  The committal of housing specific offences has a clear link to the \ndecision to enter i nto a tenancy agreement . \n53. The policy  will also significantly support LHAs to target enforcement action  (as \nreferred to above in the general legitimate aim)  across the PRS in England and \nto cross -reference landlords who operate across multiple local authorit y areas .  \n54. The government’s position is that the PRS Database measure and powers \nwithin Part 2 are proportionate in meeting these  legitimate aim s, for reasons \nthat include : \n \n21 \n - The relevant  banning order offences must have been committed in relation to \nletting property in order to fall into scope.  \n- Banning order offences will only be publicly accessible where the offence has \nbeen committed after the commencement of  Bill’s PRS database  provisions. \nResidential landlords will therefore be on notice that, subject to the exercise of \nregulation -making powers in the Bill, their relevant criminal offence data is likely \nto be disclosed for a period of time on a public database. This may act as a \ndeterrent for landlords who otherwise would go on to commit banning order \noffences.  \n- It is intended that a person will be able to search the database using search \nterms like the landlord’s name, the landlord’s unique registration number, the \nproperty address or the dwelling’s unique ID number. It will not be possible for \ntenants to view a landlord ’s entire rental portfolio or personal contact details. \nThe aim of these limited search capabilities is to promote proportionality.   \n- In practice, it is envisaged that the PRS  datab ase will operate on a self -serve \nbasis, meaning that landlords will have the opportunity to register all relevant \ndetails about themselves and their rental properties directly. Subject to \nregulations made via the Bill, landlords will also be able to demonstra te legal \ncompliance with PRS standards by providing information or documents directly \nto the Operator. Landlords will be able to access the database and update their \nregistration record at any time. This wi ll enable landlords to directly control the \ncontent of their residential landlord and dwelling entries, provided the entries \nare compliant with the PRS  database  measures  generally. The information \ncontained on the PRS  database  will be limited to what is necessary to achieve \nthe aims pursued by the Renters’ Rights Bill.  \n- The Operator must ensure LHAs are able to edit the database for the purpose \nof making entries relating to banning orders, meaning inaccurate, duplicate or \nincorrect entries about residential landlords and/or their dwellings entered by \nLHAs can be easily re ctified. The database operator will also have a power to \nedit the database, which will facilitate the correction of inaccurate and/or \nduplicate landlord and dwelling records.  \n \n22 \n - The scope of landlord personal information contained in a database entry and \nthe extent to which the information is available to the public will be limited  by \nregulations made under the Bill.  \n- Only relevant offences which are reasonably likely to have a bearing on a \nperson’s decision to enter into a tenancy agreement will be made public.  \n- The government  intend s that the regulations will  confer a function on the \ndatabase operator to provide landlords with a reasonable notice period before \na banning order database entry is made. During the notice period, landlords will \nhave the opportunity to inform the LHA and Operator of any mistakes bef ore \nthe entry goes live on the database.    \n- The Bill provides limits the period for which landlord criminal offence data can \nbe recorded on the database. . The database operator must remove an entry \nmade under clause 90 after 10 years from the day on which the entry was made.  \nPart 3 – Decent Homes Standard  \nECHR right engaged: A1P1  \n55. The proposed amendments to Part 1 of the Housing Act 2004 which will \nfacilitate the introduction of minimum requirements that rented properties must \nmeet constitute an interference with landlords’ right to the peaceful enjoyment \nof their possessions .  This  is likely to amount to a control of use.  \n56. Normally it is the immediate landlord of the occupier of the property concerned \nwhose A1P1 rights will be subject to interference as a result of the proposed \namendments to Part 1 of the HA 2004. This is because the immediate landlord \nwill, in most cases, b e subject to enforcement action by the LHA if the relevant \nrequirements are not met, and the immediate landlord will be responsible for \nthe costs of complying with those requirements. However, there may be some \ncircumstances in which a superior landlord wo uld be responsible for ensuring \ncompliance with those requirements (e.g. where the common parts of a block \nof flats fail to meet the requirements or a “rent-to-rent\" arrangement is in place).  \n \n23 \n Justification  \n57. The interference with landlords’ A1P1 rights necessitated by the introduction of \nthe D ecent Homes Standard  into the PRS is in pursuit of the general  legitimate  \ninterest  outlined above – in particular the need to ensure tenants live in a decent \nhome and to protect the health and safety of tenants. Requiring landlords to \ncomply with the DHS is proportionate relative to that aim. Arguably, landlords \nshould already be ensuring that their properties meet a minimum decency \nstandard and meeting the associated costs.  \n58. Moreover, the enforcement action to which landlords will be exposed if their \nproperty fails to meet the requirements will be subject to procedural safeguards. \nIn addition to being able to request revocation or variation of the enforcement \nnotice or order , there is a right of appeal to the First -tier Tribunal in respect of \nevery type of enforcement action (apart from the service of a hazard awareness \nnotice ). If a hazard awareness notice is served it must set out the authority’s \nreasons for deciding to serve  the notice, including their reasons for deciding \nthat serving the notice is the most appropriate course of action. Judicial review \nwill therefore be an option for a landlord who believes that a hazard awareness \nnotice has been served illegally, irrational ly or unfairly.   \n59. The revised standard will be subject to a public consultation before it is finalised, \nwhich will consider the views of those impacted, including landlords and \ntenants, and will review what proportionate costs to landlords will entail.  \nPart 4, Chapter 1: Rent Repayment Orders  \nECHR Rights engaged: Article 6 and A1P1  \n60. The provisions which bring superior landlords within scope of the licensing \noffences (and , by amendment of the provisions governing service of \nimprovement notices,  the offence of non -compliance with an improvement \nnotice ) in the Housing Act 2004  will engage  the Article  6 rights of superior \nlandlords.  This is because  these are strict  liability offences and the onus will be \n \n24 \n on superior landlord s to establish one of the statutory defences to avoid \nconviction or a rent repayment order  (RRO)  being made against them.  \n61. The provisions are also likely to engage the A1P1 rights of superior landlords \nwho may be made subject to a rent repayment order as a result of being brought \nin scope of the licensing offences in the Housing Act 2004.  \nJustification  \n62. The Housing Act 2004 RRO offences are designed to regulate conduct in the \npublic interest . There is a strong public interest in ensuring that the responsible \nperson complies with enforcement notices served under Part 1 and the \nlicensing regimes under Parts 2 and 3 to support proper management of \nhousing for the health and safety of occupiers and others. The changes made \nby the Bill aim to achieve  that by ensuring that enforcement is not circumvented \nby artificial arrangements and that action  may be taken against superior \nlandlords where appropriate.  \n63. The changes made by the Bill do not alter the offences  themselves,  which are \nand will remain strict liability,  and additional statutory defences are provided as \na safeguard for superior landlords who have  a reasonable excuse for not \nknowing that the property was one that should be licensed, or took all \nreasonably practicable steps to ensure it was  licensed , or had some other \nreasonable excuse for failing to ensure  that the property was licensed as \nrequired . This helps to strike the right balance between the public interest and \nthe protection of the rights of the individual landlord.  \n64. To the extent the provisions also engage and constitute an interference with the \nA1P1 rights of superior landlord s and corporate officers  (due to the possibility \nof them being made subject to a rent repayment orde r), this  interference would \nbe provided for by law. It would serve the legitimate public purpose of deterring \nsuperior landlords and corporate officers from committing RRO offences and \nthe penalty would be proportionate given the wide margin of appreciation \nenjoyed  by States in relation to question s of economic and social policy.  \n \n25 \n Part 4 Chapter 3 Investigatory Powers of Entry  \nECHR Rights engaged: Article 8, A1P1 and Article 6 (if legally privileged documents \nare discovered during search of premises)   \nInterference  \n65. Investigatory Powers provisions are included in the Bill to bolster the \nenforcement powers of local authorities and to enable investigat ion of  a wider \nrange of regulatory breaches and offences in the PRS.  \n66. The powers to enter domestic premises are modelled on sections 239 (powers \nof entry) and 240 (warrant to authorise entry) of the HA 2004. The powers of \nentry in relation to business premises are modelled on paragraph 23 (Power to \nenter premises without war rant) of Schedule 5 (investigatory powers) of the \nConsumer Rights Act 2015.  Both powers can be exercised with or without a \nwarrant.  \n67. In the case of routine inspections, the powers to enter both domestic and \nbusiness premises require 24 hours’ notice to be given to an occupier. Notice \nis not required, however, for non -routine inspections (where giving notice would \ndefeat the purpose of t he entry or notice is not reasonably practicable). Notice \nalso need not be given if an occupier has waived the right to notice.  \nDomestic premises  \n68. The power of entry into domestic premises, where it is suspected that the \npremises is subject to a residential tenancy, will be an interference with an \nindividual’s home and potentially private and family life for the purposes of \nArticle 8. It will also be  an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of property \nfor the purposes of A1P1. Where a power of entry is exercised with the informed \nconsent of the occupier they may be taken to have waived their rights under \nArticle 8 or Article 1 First Protocol.  \n \n26 \n 69. Article 6 could be engaged if legally privileged documents are found during a \nsearch of premises.  \nBusiness premises  \n70. Entering and searching business premises can be considered interference with \nthe right to a home under Article 8 ECHR (see Niemietz v Germany 13710/88 ). \nWhere items are seized during or following the search this will engage A1P1 \namounting to a control of property.  \nJustification  \n71.  The investigatory powers set out in the Bill are in pursuit of the general \nlegitimate aim set out above of improving the enforcement capabilities of local \nhousing authorities.  \n72. The power of entry in relation to domestic premises is limited to investigating \ntwo matters: whether there has been an offence under the Protection from \nEviction Act 1977 , or a breach or offence under the PRS Database  \n73. Under existing legislation , local councils do not have the power to enter \nresidential premises to ascertain whether an offence under section 1 Protection \nfrom Eviction Act 1977 has taken place. Th is signifi cantly impacts the ability of \nLHAs  to effectively enforce the legislation.   \n74. The powers to enter domestic premises pursues the legitimate aim of the proper \ninvestigation and enforcement of unlawful eviction and harassment, preventing \nand detecting serious crime. The effective enforcement of unlawful eviction is \nalso necessary to pr otect the rights of tenants to quiet enjoyment of their \nhomes. The power of entry into residential premises also pursues the legitimate \naim of protection of health. This is because is some cases harassment can take \nthe form of cutting off essential service s, such as gas and electricity, which can \nhave serious impacts on a tenant’s health. Entry into domestic property \nprovides a means by which local authorities can gather evidence that unlawful \neviction or harassment has occurred. Often such evidence will be  inside \n \n27 \n premises, therefore the inability to enter premises significantly weakens \nenforcement.  \n75. The power to enter domestic premises can also be exercised in order to \ninvestigate suspected breaches and offences of the Database provisions in the \nBill. In order for the  PRS Database to achieve its objectives it is crucial that a \nlandlord cannot avoid registering on the Database, simply by not registering or \nfalsely stating that a property is not rented out. The strongest evidence to \ndetermine whether a property is rented out  is obtained by effecting entry. In \ndoing so a local housing authority will be able to see evidence such as notices \nleft by landlords and locks on individual bedroom doors. The power of entry \npursues the legitimate aim of prevention of crime, protection of  health and the \nprotection of the rights and freedoms of others. With an awareness of which \nproperties are rented out , the LHA can also enforce against poor housing \nstandards and enforce tenants ’ rights, especially in respect of those tenants \nwho are vulnerable and may not know their rights or be unable to voice them. \nThe power is a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim because it \nsupports making PRS properties safe and protecting th e rights of tenants.  \nAdditionally, entry will be either with  the co -operation of the occupier or with \njudicial scrutiny through a warrant.  \n76. The Bill will also introduce the Decent Homes Standard (DHS) into Part 1 of the \nHA 2004. Section 239 of the HA 2004 already grants a LHA a power of entry to \ndetermine whether any functions under Part 1 should be exercised in relation \nto the premises in que stion. A power of entry will therefore attach to the \nenforcement of the DHS  and therefore the legitimate aims underlying t he DHS \n(protecting the health and safety of tenants by ensuring they live in a decent \nhome) also underpins the connected investigatory  powers.",

    "blurb": "The Royal Albert Hall Bill [HL] aims to amend the 1966 Act regarding annual contributions, member exclusions, and seat sales. Individuals wishing to petition against the bill must do so by 5pm on February 10, 2025. Only those directly affected can have their petitions considered. For guidance, contact the Private Bill Office at prbohoc@parliament.uk. A £20 fee is required for petitions.",
    "body": "Guidance  on petition ing against a private bill  \n \n \nPrivate bill s and petitions  \n \nA private bill is a piece of draft legislation which  is for the  interest or benefit of a particular person, \ngroup or organisation . Unlike public bills, which apply generally  and affect everyone , private bills \nonly affect a particular section of the population.  Private bills are introduced by external \nbodies, such as organisations or local authorities, rather tha n by Members of Parliament , and \nare governed by the Private Business Standing Orders . Like public bills, private bills only \nbecome law once they have been passed by both Houses of Parliament.  \n \nA petition against a private bill is a document submitted by an  individual or body who  believes \nthey would be negatively affected by the provisions outlined in the bill and therefore opposes \nthe bill’s introduction . A petition can object to the whole of a bill or only to certain parts of i t. \n \nPetitions can also be submitted against Additional Provisions, which are  amendments \nproposed by the promoter which affect further individuals or groups than were affected by \nthe provisions of original bill . In this guidance, references to petitions against a bill apply \nequally to petitions against Additional Provisions unless otherwise stated.  \n \nPetitions against private bills are separate from paper  petitions  or e-petitions . \n \nPetitioners  \n \nWhile anybody can petition against a private bill, only petitioners who are “directly and \nspecially affected” by the bill have the right to have their petitions considered  by the \ncommittee on the bill . Being “directly and specially affected ” means that the bill impacts upon \nthe rights or interests of the individual or organisation in a way which is specific to that  \nThis note is designed to assist individuals wishing to petition agains t a private bill in the \nHouse of Commons. For more information about private bills, please see the guidance \navailable on the Parliamentary website . \n \nThe deadline for submitting a petition against the Royal Albert Hall  [HL]  Bill is \n5pm on Monday 10 February  2025 . \n \nDifferent rules and deadlines  apply to private bills in the House of Lords. Please contact \nhlprivatebills@parliament.uk  for guidance relating to private bills before that House.  \n \nThe Private Bill Office in the House of Commons can be contacted in the following ways:  \n \n• By email – prbohoc@parliament.uk  \n• By phone – 020 7219 3250  \n• By post or in person – Private Bill Office, House of Commons, SW1A 0AA  \n \n \n \n \nindividual or organisation and different to the effect on people and bodies generally.  A \npetitioner can be an individual, a group  of individuals, an organisation, or a group of \norganisation s.  \n \nIf the promoter of the bill – the individual or organisation which introduced it to Parliament – \nbelieve s that a petitioner is not “directly and specially affected” by the bill , they can object to \nthe petition being considered.  See ‘Right to be heard challenges ’ below.  \n \nPetitions cannot be submitted in favour of a bill.  However, an individual  in favour of a bill in \nits original or current form can submit a petition against alteration  in response to any changes  \nwhich are proposed to be made to the bill at committee  stage (which can come from \namendments proposed by the promoter or those that have been or will be requested by \npetitioners or made by the committee ). For more information on petitions against alteration, \nplease contact the Private Bill Office.  \n \nWriting a petition  \n \nContent  and structure  \n \nA petition  against a private bill should:  \n \n- Explain who the petitioner /s is and where they live (or what the affected business is \nand where its premises are located ); \n- Describe how the petitioner’s property or other interests are directly and specially \naffected  by the provisions of the bill ; \n- State what the petitioner  thinks should  be done to reduce  the adverse  effects  the bill \nmay have on their property  or interests and how the bill should  be amended  to \nachieve this. \n \nA petition should not include:  \n \n- Pictures, maps or photos. A submitted petition should only include text. Petitioners will \nhave the opportunity to share evidence such as photos or maps during their \nappearance before the committee appointed to consider petitions against the bill.  \n- Comprehensive evidence or explanations. The initial petition should outline the \ngrounds upon which the petitioner is petitioning and summarise  the issues involved . \nDetailed explanations can be given during an appearance before the committee . \n \nThe petition  will form the basis of the petitioner’s case to the committee  on the bill so it must \ninclude  all objections the petitioner wishes  to raise. Petitioners are not able to raise matters \nbefore  the committee if they are not referred to in the initial  petition.  \nA petition  template , which should be used for all petitions, is available on the Parliamentary \nwebsite ; linked here . \n \nWhen submitting a petition, petitioners will be required to give consent to certain terms and \nconditions, which include the sharing of the petition with the bill’s promoter and publication of \nthe petition on the Parliament website. Petitions published on t he Parliament website will have \nthe full address and contact details of the petitioners removed.  \n \n \n \nSupport  \n \nStaff of the Private Bill Office can review petitions sent in draft in advance of formal \nsubmission. Feedback will only be given on form and structure ; House staff will not comment \non the arguments or evidence contained in a petition , and cannot confirm  whether a petitioner \ndoes or does not have a right to be heard . \n \nPetitioners seeking views on a draft petition should ensure that it is made available to staff in \nthe Private Bill Office in sufficient time before the end of the petitioning period. Staff cannot \nguarantee to be able to provide specific advice or guidance on a petition if insufficient time is \ngiven before the relevant deadline.  \n \nSubmitting a petition  \n \nWhen to submit  \n \nAfter a private bill is presented to Parliament, a petitioning period is arranged , during which  \ntime petitions can be submitted . Petitions can only be submitted during the appointed \npetitioning period.  The length of the petitioning period is determined by the Private Business \nStanding Orders, and usually lasts for between seven and ten days.  \n \nThe deadline for submitting a petition against the Royal Albert Hall  [HL] Bill is \n5pm on Monday 10 February  2025 . \n \nThe introduction of an Additional Provision  trigger s a further petitioning period , the timing of \nwhich will be announced separately . \n \nHow to submit  \n \nDuring  the relevant petitioning  period,  petition s can be submitted  via an online  portal  on the \nParliament ary website . A link to the portal will be published when the petitioning period opens. \nIf a petitioner cannot use the portal, their petition  should be sent  as a Microsoft Word \nattachment to an email to prbohoc@parliament.uk  or by post to  the Private Bill Office, House of \nCommons, SW1A 0AA.  Letters postmarked on or before the deadline date will be accepted as \nsubmitted i n time.  \n \nPayment  \n \nThere  is an administration  fee of £20 per petition  (not per petitioner ). Payments can be made:  \n \n- By bank transfer, using sort code 60 -70-80 and account number 10022317 , with your \nname as the reference;  \n- By cheque, payable to ‘HOC Administration 2’ ; or \n- By post or in person, to Private Bill Office, House of Commons, SW1A 0AA.  \n \nA petition  will not be considered  by the committee  on the bill if the fee has not been received.  \n \nPetition ers against a bill do not have to pay again should they wish to also petition against \nany Additional Provisions introduced in relation to the same bill. However, petitioners do need \n \n \nto pay a further £20 fee should they  wish to petition again when the bill is considered in the \nHouse of Lords.  \n \nAfter submission  \n \nNext stages  \n \nPetitions submitted against a private bill will be sent to the bill’s promoter, who may contact \npetitioners to discuss their concerns with the bill.  Petitions will be assigned a petition number \nand an edited version (with sections 1, 5, 6 and 7 from the petition template and some \npetitioner address information removed)  will be published on the  Parliament  website . \n \nAfter the petitioning period closes, and subject to the bill receiving its second reading  in the \nHouse, the bill will be referred to a committee . If petitions have been submitted against the \nbill it will be referred to an opposed bill committee , which will hear from the promoter of the \nbill and any petitioners against the bill and decide whether the case for the bill has been \nproved or whether any amendments are needed.  If no petitions have been received, the bill \nwill be referred to an unopposed bill committee , which will hear only from the bill’s promoters.   \n \nBoth forms of committee can approve the bill, approve it with amendments or with \nundertakings from the promoters, make a special report to the House, or decide that the need \nfor the bill has not been proven . In this latter  case, the bill cannot  proceed any further . \n \nAppearing before the committee  \n \nPetitioners against a bill may be invited to appear before the committee considering the bill. \nPetitioners wishing to speak to their petition before the committee can do so in person or can \nbe represented by someone else. This may, but does not have to be , a qualified legal \nprofessional  – it can, for instance, be a friend or family member. There are professional \nParliamentary Agents (solicitors accredited by Parliament who specialise in promoting and \nopposing private bills), known as “Roll A” Agents who can be employed to act on a petitioner’s \nbehalf. A list of registered Roll A Agents is kept on the Parliamentary website . \n \nIf a petition has been submitted on behalf of a group of individuals, one of the petitioners may \nact on behalf of their co -petitioners, as their representative, provided  all of the co-petitioners  \nconsent.  Alternatively,  the group  could ask someone  else to represent them (as above).  \nBusinesses or organisations should hold a  properly  constituted  meeting  and pass resolutions  \nauthorising  a named person (who can be a member of the organisation or an external \nindividual hired to represent them) to act as a representative  before the committee . Local \nauthorities must be represented by a nominated individual, who can be a councillor or \nsomeone else.  \n \nIndividuals nominated to represent a group or organisation can also petition as an individual \nif they are personally directly and specially affected by the bill.  However, petitions submitted \nin an individual capacity cannot be used to give evidence on behalf of the group or organisation \nthe petitioner has separately been requested to represent, and vice versa.  \n \nPetitioners appearing before private bill committees will have the opportunity to call witnesses \nin support of their petition, and to submit evidence for consideration by the committee.  \n \n \n \nRight to be heard challenges  \n \nIf the promoter of a bill objects to  the right of a petitioner  to be heard by the committee on \nthe bill , on the grounds that they do not believe th at the petitioner is  directly and specially \naffected by the bill, a ‘right to be heard’ hea ring will be arranged before  the Court of Referees  \n(unless the petitioner does not wish to contest the promoter’s objection) .  \n \nIn such a hearing, a petitioner (or their representative) has the opportunity to speak in support \nof their right to be heard by the committee on their petition, and the promoter will speak in \nreply, challenging that right. The Court of Referees will then determine whether the petitioner \nwill be heard.  \n \nWithdrawal  \n \nPetitioners can  withdraw a petition at any time  (or withdraw a name from a petition with \nmultiple signatories)  by emailing or writing to the Private Bill Office . The fee paid upon \nsubmission will not be refunded.  \n \nIn the case of p etitions with multiple signatories, names can be withdrawn by individual \nsignatories but the petition itself can only be withdrawn with the consent of all petitioners.",

\n“rules  of court”  means  rules  relating  to the practice  and procedure  of a \ncourt  or tribunal. \n5 2 Meaning  of “SLAPP”  claim \n(1) For the purposes  of section  1 a claim  is a “SLAPP  claim”  if— \n(a) the claim  relates  to an expression  or potential  expression  made  or to \nbe made  by the defendant  which  discloses  or would  disclose \ninformation  relating  to a matter  of public  interest, \n10 (b) the claimant’s  behaviour  in relation  to the matters  complained  of in \nthe claim  is such  that it is reasonable  to conclude  that the behaviour \nhas, or is intended  to have,  the effect  of restraining  the defendant’s \nexercise  by that disclosure  or potential  disclosure  of the right  to \nfreedom  of speech,  and \n15 (c) any of the behaviour  of the claimant  in relation  to the matters \ncomplained  of in the claim  is such  that it is reasonable  to conclude \nthat the behaviour  is intended  to cause  the defendant  any harm  or \ninconvenience  beyond  that ordinarily  encountered  in the course  of \nproperly  conducted  litigation. \n20 (2) In subsection  (1)(c)  the reference  to “harm”  includes  (but is not limited  to) a \nreference  to any of the following— \n(a) expense; \n(b) harassment; \n(c) alarm; \n25 (d) distress. \n(3) For the purposes  of determining  whether  a claim  meets  the condition  in \nsubsection  (1)(b), any limitation  prescribed  by law on the exercise  of the right \nto freedom  of speech  (for example  in relation  to the making  of defamatory \nstatements)  is to be ignored. \n30 (4) For the purposes  of subsection  (1)(a) the matters  that are of “public  interest” \ninclude  (but are not limited  to) the following— \n(a) behaviour  of the claimant  or any other  person  that is, or is alleged  to \nbe, unlawful; \n(b) \n35statements  made  by the claimant  or any other  person  that are, or are \nalleged  to be, false; \n(c) public  health  and safety,  the climate  or the environment; \n(d) an investigation  or review  being  undertaken  by a public  body. \n(5) In determining  whether  any behaviour  of the claimant  falls within  subsection \n(1)(c), the court  may,  in particular,  take into account— \n40 (a) whether  the behaviour  is a disproportionate  reaction  to the matters \ncomplained  of in the claim,  including  whether  the costs  incurred  by \nthe claimant  are out of proportion  to the remedy  sought; Strategic  Litigation  Against  Public  Participation  Bill 2 \n(b) whether  the defendant  has access  to fewer  resources  with  which  to \ndefend  the claim  than  another  person  against  whom  the claimant  could \nhave  brought  (but did not bring)  proceedings  in relation  to the matters \ncomplained  of in the claim; \n5 (c) any relevant  failure,  or anticipated  failure,  by the claimant  (or a person \nacting  on behalf  of a claimant)  to comply  with  a pre-action  protocol, \nrule of court  or practice  direction,  or to comply  with  or follow  a rule \nor recommendation  of a professional  regulatory  body. \n(6) \n10For the purposes  of subsection  (5)(c) a failure,  or anticipated  failure,  is \n“relevant”  so far as it relates  to— \n(a) the choice  of jurisdiction, \n(b) the use of dilatory  strategies, \n(c) the nature  or amount  of material  sought  on disclosure, \n(d) responses  to requests  for comment  or clarification, \n15 (e) the use of correspondence, \n(f) making  or responding  to offers  to settle,  or \n(g) the use of alternative  dispute  resolution  procedures. \n(7) In this section— \n“court”  has the same  meaning  as in section  1;

Th\nis Bill amends the Railways Act 1993 (“the 1993 Act”) to remove the\npresumption in favour of private sector operation of franchised passenger\nservices. It is intended to facilitate the Government’s commitment tobring such train operations back into public ownership when the currentfranchise agreements end. The Bill contains two delegated powers, and theDepartment for Transport has provided a delegated powers memorandum(“the memorandum”).\n1 We draw the attention of the House to one of those\npowers.\n2. Th\ne Bill operates by generally prohibiting both the extension of existing\nprivate sector franchise agreements and the entering into of new suchagreements. However, the Bill also inserts two new sections into the 1993Act (sections 30A and 30B) which will allow the continuation of the existingprivate sector franchise arrangements, where the Secretary of State is thefranchising authority and is satisfied that it will not be reasonably practicableto provide passenger rail services by a public sector company when theexisting private sector franchise agreement comes to an end.\n3.\nSu\nbsection (4) of section 30A enables the Secretary of State by regulations\nto repeal that section and section 30B. Despite being a Henry VIII power,the regulations are subject only to the negative resolution procedure. Theuse of the negative resolution procedure is explained in paragraph 16 of thememorandum on the basis of the limited scope of the power and the fact thatthe power is intended only for the purpose of removing the provisions oncethey become obsolete.\n4.\nWe c\nonsider that the negative resolution procedure would be appropriate if\nthe power could only be exercised once sections 30A and 30B are spent (whichwill be the case when all the existing private sector franchising arrangementshave come to an end). However, that limitation does not appear in section30A(4) as drafted; instead it simply confers a power on the Secretary of Stateto repeal sections 30A and 30B, without limiting the circumstances in whichthe power may be exercised.\n5.\nAc\ncordingly, we recommend that the House seeks clarification from\nthe Minister as to:\n• whether the Government intend that the power to repeal sections30A and 30B should only be exercised once all the existing privatesector franchising arrangements have come to an end; and\n• why, if that is the intention, the power is not limited so that itmay only be exercised in those circumstances.\nWe also take the view that, in the absence of such a limitation, the affirmative resolution procedure should apply.\n1 Memorandum on the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill from the Department for \nTransport to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (5 September 2024): https://\nbills.parliament.uk/publications/56125/documents/5043\n2\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n PRODUCT REGULATION AND METROLOGY BILL [HL]\n6. T\nhis Bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 4 September. Its Second\nReading took place on 8 October.\n7. T\nhe Bill makes provision with respect to:\n• the marketing and use of products;\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether\nof goods or other things); and\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed.\n8. T\nhe Bill contains 14 clauses and one schedule.\n9. T\nhe Department for Business and Trade has provided a Delegated Powers\nMemorandum (“the Memorandum”)2 for the Bill.\n10. W\ne draw the following powers to the attention of the House.\n Clause 1, 2, 3 and 9—powers to make product regulations\n11. T\nhese clauses make provision with respect to the regulation of the marketing\nand use of all products3 (both consumer products and industrial products)\nin the UK save only for the “excluded products” listed in the Schedule tothe Bill. The excluded products include food, products of animal origin,aircraft, military equipment, medicines and medical devices.\n12.\nC\nlause 1 gives the Secretary of State power to make provision by regulations\nin relation to the marketing or use of products in the UK (“productregulations”), for the purpose of:\n• reducing or mitigating risks presented by products;\n• ensuring that products operate efficiently or effectively; or\n• ensuring that products designed for weighing or measuring operateaccurately.\n13.\nC\nlause 1 also gives the Secretary of State power to include in product\nregulations provision which corresponds, or is similar, to a provision of EUlaw\n4 for the purpose of reducing or mitigating the environmental impact of\nproducts.\n14. C\nlause 2 sets out matters in relation to which product regulations may impose\n“product requirements”. It also specifies categories of persons on whom suchrequirements may be imposed. Clause 2(7) allows product regulations toprovide that “product requirements” are to be treated as met if requirementsof EU law specified in those regulations are met.\n2 Memorandum on the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill [HL] from the Department for Business \nand Trade to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (30 August 2024): https://\nbills.parliament. uk/publications/56126/documents/5044\n3 “Product” is broadly defined in clause 1(5) as “a tangible item that results from a method of \nproduction”.\n4 The provision must correspond, or be similar, to a provision of “relevant EU law”, which means EU \nlaw that has the purpose of harmonising the conditions for the marketing or use of products in the EU.\n3\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n15. Clause 3 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of product \nregulations.\n16. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby product regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by Parts \n2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof Acts \n1868 to 1978 and section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights Act \n2015.\n17. The power to make product regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised:\n• to create or widen the scope of a criminal offence;\n• to create powers of entry, inspection or search;\n• to disapply or modify product regulations in cases of emergency;\n• to make provision about the disclosure of information by or to a relevant \nauthority5 carrying out functions under product regulations;\n• to make provision for a relevant authority to impose fees in respect of \ncosts incurred by the authority in carrying out its functions; or\n• to amend or repeal primary legislation.\n Skeleton legislation\n18. Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill are an example of what the Committee refers \nto as “skeleton legislation”. They contain almost no substance about the \nmarketing and use of products but instead give Ministers very broad powers \nwhich confer considerable discretion to legislate in that area by statutory \ninstrument. Almost all of the substance of the regulatory regime that is to \ngovern the marketing and use of products (including product safety) is to \nbe left to regulations. Even existing provision in primary legislation may \nbe replaced by provision in regulations. And the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied.\n19. The concern with “skeleton legislation” is its compatibility with the \nestablished principle that the principal aspects of policy should be on the face \nof a bill and only its detailed implementation left to delegated legislation. As \nwe stated in our Democracy Denied Report6: “Skeleton legislation signifies \nan exceptional shift in power from Parliament to the executive and entails \nthe Government, in effect, asking Parliament to pass primary legislation \nwhich is so insubstantial that it leaves the real operation of the legislation to \nbe decided by ministers”7.\n20. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee8 states that “Skeleton legislation should only be used in the most \nexceptional circumstances”. It adds that, if a Bill contains a skeleton clause, \n5 Under clause 3, product regulations may designate a person as a “relevant authority” with powers to \nenforce product regulations.\n6 12th Report  (Session 2021–22, HL Paper 106)\n7 At para 66.\n8 Guidance for Departments (December 2023): https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/42694/\ndocuments/212126/default/\n4\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nthe Delegated Powers Memorandum that a department must prepare to assist \nthe Committee with its scrutiny of the Bill should provide a full justification \nfor this approach, including why no other approach was reasonable to adopt \nand how the scope of the skeleton provision is constrained.\n21. We consider that the Memorandum fails to meet this requirement in respect \nof clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Bill.\n22. The first respect in which the Memorandum falls short is in its explanation \nof the existing legislation that could be amended and indeed replaced by \nregulations made under the powers in those clauses.\n23. Both the Memorandum and the Explanatory Notes to the Bill have little to \nsay about that existing legislation beyond high-level statements such as the \nfollowing:\n• the sale and supply of the “huge number” of products to which the Bill \napplies is “underpinned by an extensive body of law”9;\n• “the legal landscape is complex and technical, primarily set out in \nsecondary legislation and based on assimilated law”10 (the body of UK \ndomestic law derived originally from EU obligations); and\n• “The product regulatory framework in the UK covers most consumer \nproducts, for example toys and cosmetics, and a significant number \nof industrial products too, such as lifts and pressure equipment. The \noverwhelming majority of this legislation is assimilated law, transposed \ninto UK law while the UK was part of the EU and then assimilated \nfollowing the EU exit process”11.\n24. The Memorandum fails to identify the legislation in question or to explain \nwhat it does or its significance in policy terms. It even fails to explain in any \ndetail the content and significance in policy terms of the primary legislation \nthat could be replaced by regulations made under the Bill.\n25. This scarcity of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make. This gives rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nthe Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might be considered \nsufficiently important in policy terms to instead merit inclusion in the \nBill itself, where they would be subject to the much greater Parliamentary \nscrutiny afforded to primary legislation.\n26. This most obviously applies to those aspects of the existing regulatory \nregime that are contained in primary legislation that the Bill allows to be \nreplaced and repealed by product regulations12. The fact that the Bill allows \nthis merits a full explanation and a compelling justification. Yet although the \nMemorandum states that the repeal of that primary legislation by regulations \nis sufficiently important to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny, it offers no \nexplanation as to why matters that have hitherto been considered sufficiently \n9 At para 2 of the Memorandum.\n10 At para 13 of the Memorandum. “Assimilated law” includes (a) post-EU Exit UK versions of EU \nRegulations, and (b) UK statutory instruments made to give effect to EU obligations.\n11 At para 5 of the Explanatory Notes.\n12 Consumer Protection Act 1987, parts  2, 4 and 5; Gun Barrel Proof Acts 1868 to  1978 ; Consumer \nRights Act 2015, section 77  and schedule 5 .\n5\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in primary legislation should be \nleft to regulations at all.\n27.  It is also unclear whether there may be aspects of the regulatory regime that \nare currently contained in assimilated law (the body of UK domestic law \nderived originally from EU obligations) that might be considered sufficiently \nimportant in policy terms to merit inclusion in the Bill rather than in \nregulations.\n28. Even where that assimilated law is contained in subordinate legislation, \nthat is not by itself a good reason for any replacement provisions also to be \ncontained in subordinate legislation. This is a point that we have made in \nseveral previous reports, including our report on the Medicines and Medical \nDevices Bill13, where the Government sought to justify wide skeleton powers \non the basis that it was replacing one set of regulations with another. In that \ncase, we emphasised14 that the existing regulations had been made under the \nspecial power in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, the \npurpose of which was to allow EU law requirements to be implemented in \nUK domestic law by subordinate legislation - and that the power in section \n2(2) was subject to “a critical constraint”: it gave Ministers “power to make \nlaws giving effect to EU law–not simply power to make laws that Ministers \nmay wish to make”.\n29. In our report on the Energy Bill, we stated that:\n“the fact that provisions governing a subject area are currently contained \nin regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities \nAct 1972 does not by itself make it appropriate to use a regulation-\nmaking power to amend and extend the provisions in that subject area. \nInstead, the proposal to confer regulation-making powers needs to be \njustified on its own merits, particularly where, as in these cases, they are \nframework powers which are therefore capable of providing a very broad \nscope of regulation-making powers to the Secretary of State.”15\n30. The justification given in the Memorandum for the powers in clauses 1, 2, 3 \nand 9 is that:\n• aspects of the regulatory regime for products may need to be updated \nswiftly and frequently (for example “to respond to emerging hazards \nand risks, and developments in technology and scientific or technical \nunderstanding”16); and\n• the powers will give Ministers the flexibility to legislate to align UK law \nwith EU rules or to diverge from those rules.\n31. We consider that, whilst these may be reasonable arguments for the Bill \nconferring powers that allow some aspects of the regulatory regime for \nproducts to be provided for in delegated legislation, the Government have \nnot explained why the Bill goes so much further and instead provides for \nalmost all of the substance of that regulatory regime to be provided for by \nMinisters in regulations under the new powers, with little or nothing to be \nsettled under the fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions.\n13 19th Report  (Session 2019–21, HL Paper 109).\n14 At para 20.\n15 11th Report  (Session 2022–23, HL Paper 66), para 44.\n16 At para 38.\n6\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n32. The concern with powers of this kind is that they give Ministers maximum \nflexibility to choose the direction that the law will take. Ministers could, \nshould they so wish, use these powers as a mechanism for ensuring that \nUK domestic law on product regulation is completely aligned with EU law. \nAlternatively, they could use the powers to provide for UK domestic law to \ndiverge in significant respects from EU law. Whatever direction Ministers \nmay choose to take the law in - and however significant in policy terms that \nmay be–it is to be done by means of delegated legislation that will be subject \nonly to a relatively low level of parliamentary scrutiny.\n33. The Memorandum also fails to explain why  the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirements for consultation, for criteria to be met or for \nmeaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied - and it fails to say whether this \nrepresents a divergence from the existing regulatory regime. We note with \ninterest that at least one existing regulation-making power that the powers to \nmake product regulations are designed to replace (the power of the Secretary \nof State under section 11 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to make \n“safety regulations” with respect to goods) is, unlike the new powers, subject \nto consultation requirements.\n Power to set the ingredients of criminal offences\n34. Clause 3(9)(a) is particularly worthy of mention. It provides that product \nregulations may create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences for such \nthings as non-compliance with product regulations or obstruction of, or \nfailure to assist or co-operate with, a product safety inspector.\n35. Our Guidance for Departments on the role and requirements of the \nCommittee states as follows17:\n“Where the ingredients of a criminal offence are to be set by delegated \nlegislation, the Committee would expect a compelling justification”.\nThe Memorandum explains18 why it considers the power in clause 3(9)(a) to \nbe sufficiently significant to merit affirmative procedure scrutiny but it fails \nto provide a justification for taking the power in the first place.\n36. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for products; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 1, 2, 3 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n Clauses 5, 6 and 9—powers to make metrology regulations\n37. Clause 5 gives the Secretary of State power to make “metrology regulations”, \nabout:\n17 Guidance for Departments (November 2021), para 12: https://committees.parliament.uk/\npublications/8225/documents/84262 /default/\n18 At para 54.\n7\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n• the units of measurement that are used to express quantities (whether \nof goods19 or other things), including how such units of measurement \nmust or may be calculated;\n• the quantities in which goods must or may be marketed; and\n• the units of measurement that must or may be used to express such \nquantities.\n38. Metrology regulations may impose requirements in relation to matters \nincluding:\n• the marketing or packaging of goods;\n• the monitoring, assessment and verification of the quantities in which \ngoods are marketed and the units of measurement used to express such \nquantities; and\n• the retention of documents and information.\n39. Clause 6 makes provision with respect to the enforcement of metrology \nregulations. The provision made is identical in all material respects to that \nmade in clause 3 with respect to the enforcement of product regulations.\n40. Clause 9 provides that, in consequence of any provision made by the Bill or \nby metrology regulations, such regulations may repeal provision made by \nParts 2, 4 and 5 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gun Barrel Proof \nActs 1868 to 1978, section 77 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Consumer Rights \nAct 2015 and the Weights and Measures Act 1985.\n41. The power to make metrology regulations is subject to the negative procedure \nsave where it is exercised for purposes equivalent to those specified in \nparagraph 17 above with respect to the power to make product regulations.\n42. Clauses 5, 6 and 9 are another example of “skeleton legislation”. They \ncontain almost no substance about units of measurement and the quantities \nin which goods must or may be marketed. Instead, they confer very broad \npowers to make such provision by regulations.\n43. We consider that the concerns set out above with respect to the powers to \nmake product regulations apply equally to the powers to make metrology \nregulations, namely that:\n• almost all of the substance is left to regulations;\n• skeleton legislation is only justifiable in the most exceptional \ncircumstances and the Memorandum fails to provide the full \njustification that we expect where a Bill takes this approach;\n• the Memorandum fails to adequately explain the content—and \nsignificance in policy terms—of the existing legislation that could be \namended and indeed replaced by metrology regulations;\n• this lack of explanation makes it difficult to understand the significance \nof the changes that the powers could be used to make, giving rise to \nuncertainty as to whether there may be aspects of the existing regulatory \n19 “Goods” are broadly defined in clause 5(4) as “tangible items (including packaging or labels)”.\n8\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\nregime that the Bill leaves to be provided for in regulations which might \nbe considered sufficiently important to merit inclusion in the Bill;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace and repeal primary \nlegislation merits a full explanation and a compelling justification but \nthe Memorandum fails to provide this;\n• the power to use metrology regulations to replace all aspects of the \nexisting regulatory regime that are currently contained in assimilated \nlaw merits a full explanation and justification but the Memorandum \nfails to provide this;\n• the Government argues that aspects of the regulatory regime may need \nto be updated swiftly and frequently but they have not explained why \nthe Bill provides for almost all of the substance of that regime to be \nprovided for in regulations, with little or nothing to be settled under \nthe fuller scrutiny given to Bill provisions;\n• the Memorandum fails to explain why the exercise of the powers is \nunfettered by any requirement for consultation, for criteria to be met or \nfor meaningful pre-conditions to be satisfied; and\n• the Memorandum fails to provide a justification for the power in clause \n6(9)(a) to create, or widen the scope of, criminal offences.\n44. We consider that:\n• the Government have failed to provide a convincing justification \nfor the inclusion of skeleton clauses in the Bill that give Ministers \nsuch wide powers to re-write in regulations the substance of the \nregulatory regime for metrology; and\n• accordingly, the delegations of power in clauses 5, 6 and 9 are \ninappropriate and should be removed from the Bill.\n9\nDELEGATED POWERS AND REGULATORY REFORM COMMITTEE\n WATER (SPECIAL MEASURES) BILL [HL]\n45.
