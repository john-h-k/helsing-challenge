    "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK Treasury is on course for a windfall of more than £40bn over the next 20 years, new estimates show, as thousands of heirs of people who converted pension promises into a cash lump sum following “pension freedoms” in 2015 face inheritance tax bills.\n\nThe government estimates that pension tax changes will raise £1.46bn a year by 2029-30, but consultants at Lane Clark & Peacock, an actuarial adviser, estimate that revenue raised from UK-wide transfers out of defined benefit to defined contribution schemes will surge from £470mn in 2029-30 to more than £3bn a year by the mid 2040s.\n\n“The figures in the red book [Budget documents] don’t do justice to the long-term scale of the tax increase which could easily be over £40bn over the next two decades,” said Sir Steve Webb, partner at LCP and former pensions minister.\n\nRevenue is set to rise sharply because of a surge in pension transfer activity several years ago. In 2015, the then chancellor George Osborne introduced rights allowing individuals to move their defined benefit pension scheme to a defined contribution pot.\n\nMore than 100,000 transfers were undertaken in the five years after that, according to LCP, and six-figure transfer values were the norm. In many cases these transfers were undertaken specifically so the value of those pension pots could be passed on when the member died.\n\nIn last year’s Budget, chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that unused pension funds will be included within IHT from April 2027.\n\n“Applying inheritance tax to pension balances could prove to be a real gold mine for the government for many years to come,” said Tim Camfield, senior consultant at LCP, who carried out the analysis.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that some retirees may react to tax changes by drawing down on pension assets faster, the changes will still generate significant tax revenue because such withdrawals will be subject to income tax, he said.\n\n“Either way, as the DB transfer generation gets older, the government will start to see a multibillion pound revenue stream from the income tax or IHT on their pension pots,” Camfield added.\n\nAccording to a freedom of information request from investment platform Interactive Investor to the Office for Budget Responsibility, an estimated 31,200 more estates will be subject to IHT in the three years from the 2027-28 tax year than if pensions had not been included in estates.\n\nThe OBR estimates that 66,600 people will pay inheritance tax in 2029-30, up from 40,100 in the current tax year.\n\nLCP calculates that these numbers should continue to surge because the peak in transfer activity from DB schemes to DC schemes was in 2017-18, after which tighter rules around financial advice followed by a fall in transfer values led to a dramatic reduction in the volume of transfers.\n\nThe typical person who transferred was in their late fifties, according to LCP. As these people gradually die over the coming years, any unspent balances in their transferred pension fund will be potentially liable to IHT.\n\nRob Morgan, chief analyst at wealth manager Charles Stanley, said that enhanced death benefits tended to be “the overriding factor” for people choosing to transfer out of DB into DC.\n\n“On the basis that people will mostly have only done this where there is ample income and assets elsewhere, we can infer that there will be IHT consequences in many cases,” Morgan said.\n\nData from the Financial Conduct Authority shows that between April 2015 and September 2018, more than 170,000 people who received advice transferred their DB scheme to a DC pot, with an average transfer value of over £350,000. This suggests the total amount transferred in this period was over £50bn.\n\nShaun Moore, tax and financial planning expert at Quilter, a wealth manager, said a freeze in the inheritance tax threshold — which is set to last until 2030 — plus the inclusion of pensions from 2027 would enable the government to “cash in on an ever-expanding pool of taxpayers”.\n\nThe IHT tax-free threshold has been set at £325,000 since 2009. The impact of the frozen threshold alongside inflation and rising asset values means more people have been dragged into paying inheritance tax, with the trend likely to continue.",

    "blurb": "UK government argue that funds should release surpluses back to companies for investment",
    "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Pension trustees warn that allowing companies to access surpluses trapped in defined benefit pension schemes is unlikely to deliver the jolt to the economy that the government hopes for.\n\nThe UK government said this week that lifting the restrictions on companies using money from their DB pension schemes — in excess of what they owe members — would “unlock billions to drive growth”.\n\nAccording to an FT analysis of company accounts there are over 30 companies in the FTSE 100 with DB schemes with surpluses of at least £100mn and a funding ratio of at least 110 per cent. Most declined to comment when contacted by the FT.\n\nEnergy company SSE said it was looking at the opportunities the reforms represent, but noted any impact would be relatively small.\n\nSchroders said after the announcement its would use ‘’approximately 10 per cent’’ of its scheme’s DB section’s surplus per year to support funding for defined contribution members.\n\nMost schemes can already access surpluses in their DB schemes, provided they passed a resolution in 2016 permitting them to do so, according to pensions consultant LCP. But in practice few do.\n\nOnly £180mn of surplus was accessed by companies between 2018 to 2023, according to government estimates last year. Any surplus extracted is taxed at a rate of 25 per cent, having been lowered from 35 per cent last year.\n\nWhere DB and DC pension funds are set up within the same trust, DB surpluses can be transferred to DC members if the scheme rules permit it without incurring a tax charge.\n\nTrade groups have broadly welcomed the government’s proposals, provided appropriate guardrails are in place to protect members, but trustees have privately expressed doubts.\n\n“Why would I want to give away my comfort blanket?” said one trustee of a FTSE 100 company pension scheme. He was sceptical that he would be prepared to release its surplus to executives, noting that for many years the scheme was in deficit and a fall in government bond yields could make its funding position more vulnerable.\n\n“It’s not going to be the silver bullet that the government hopes for,” said another, adding that the total DB scheme surplus was only about £68bn on a buyout basis — the level at which companies with the right permissions can access their surpluses.\n\n“First you have to work out how much to give members, then you have to agree how much to give the company factoring you will have to pay 25 per cent tax,” he said, adding that the time it takes to make these decisions was also “not trivial”.\n\nRob Gardner, former co-chief executive of pensions consultancy Redington and founder of Rebalance Earth, a flood mitigation investor, said if he were a trustee weighing the return of a surplus to an employer there would be “significant challenges”.\n\n“My fiduciary duty is to act in the best interests of members, and the potential long-term risks to them may outweigh the short-term benefits to the employer,” he said.\n\nThe government estimates that around 75 per cent of the UK’s £1.2tn defined benefit corporate pension schemes are in surplus, worth a total of around £160bn. Some 96 per cent of these schemes — which provide pensions to 8.8mn people — are closed to new members.\n\nMinisters have been working out how to extract money from DB schemes after a rapid rise in interest rates radically improved scheme funding levels in 2022. The government’s plans follow a consultation by the Conservative government last spring.\n\nPolicymakers also hope trustees will be emboldened to invest in more risky assets, rather than preparing schemes to be sold to insurance companies in a process known as buyout.\n\nBut Sankar Mahalingham, managing director at professional trustee firm Law Debenture, said it was “unlikely that there will be a large number who will suddenly take a very different look at their investment strategy”.\n\nAccording to the Pension Protection Fund, schemes had a net deficit on a buyout basis of almost £500bn as recently as 2019. That figure is now a surplus of £68bn.\n\nWhen the Financial Times asked the Treasury if it would lower the ‘buyout basis’ threshold, a spokesperson said that “schemes will continue to have to satisfy stringent funding requirements to be eligible to extract surplus”.\n\nThe previous government’s consultation explored enhancing protection from the Pension Protection Fund to 100 per cent to encourage trustees to be more comfortable with taking on more risk and releasing surpluses, as well as assessing if the tax rate for tapping surpluses should be lowered.\n\nThe Treasury told the FT it would set out these details “in the spring”.",

    "blurb": "Prime minister will listen to business over exact details, as some within Labour push for ‘serious tooth removal’  ",
    "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer is resisting pressure from business and some within his own party to tear up a new workers’ rights bill, even as government officials conceded that details of the policy were still up for grabs.\n\nThe prime minister’s allies told the Financial Times he was fully committed to the “make work pay” plan, which is seen in Number 10 as essential to tackling low pay, improving insecure employment and raising productivity even though it is expected to cost businesses £5bn.\n\nBut senior Labour figures argue it may have to be made more business-friendly in the coming weeks.\n\n“It needs serious tooth removal,” said one Labour official close to Starmer. Another influential adviser said: “There is a view in the Treasury and DBT [business and trade department] that this shouldn’t upset the growth apple cart too much.”\n\nThe workers’ rights package was a key promise in Labour’s manifesto, but business leaders have warned that piling even more costs on to companies will imperil the growth ambitions that Starmer and chancellor Rachel Reeves have set out as their core mission for the government.\n\nStarmer insisted in the House of Commons this week he would not abandon the principles of the legislation. “We believe in giving people proper dignity and protection at work,” he said, calling the bill “good for working people and good for the economy”.\n\nOne Starmer aide said: “We want the economy to grow and are prepared to take on the political fights to get that, but we also want some of the proceeds of growth to flow into the pockets of workers, especially tackling low pay and insecure employment.”\n\nThe aide added: “We have consulted on the application of how we do that. So the measures may adjust to reflect that policy objective, but they will not limit our ambitions.”\n\nMinisters are consulting businesses, unions and others on details of the Employment Rights bill, which is due to report to the House of Commons before Easter, in an increasingly tense political atmosphere.\n\nBusinesses are already smarting from last year’s tax-raising Budget and a hike in the minimum wage that comes into force this April, while companies such as J Sainsbury and Airbus have already blamed higher costs for recent job cuts in the UK.\n\nNicola Smith, director of policy at the Trades Union Congress, said she believed ministers had strengthened their commitment to some parts of the bill, including a near-ban on employers using “fire and rehire” tactics to impose changes in contracts, which the legislation will allow only where a business is close to insolvency.\n\n“From where I’m sitting, we don’t see any change of ambition,” she added.\n\nThe proposals in the controversial package include scaling back zero-hours contracts and giving staff full rights of redress from their first day of employment.\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch this week branded it the “unemployment bill” and called on Starmer to ditch the entire package.\n\nOne imminent compromise will see ministers address concerns that employers could find themselves in endless consultation with unions over unconnected redundancies at different sites under the legislation as currently drafted.\n\nAt present, they are required to consult only when they make 20 or more workers redundant at a single site.\n\nMinisters have said they will bring forward amendments to the bill at the next stage of the parliamentary process — and both business and unions believe the timing of this next stage could slip into March.\n\nCraig Beaumont of the Federation of Small Businesses said two areas of focus for business lobbyists were around the proposals for day one protection against unfair dismissal, and the mechanism of the proposed “ban” on exploitative zero and low hour contracts. However, he acknowledged the FSB was “pitching for the stars” in urging ministers to change the day one right to a protection that kicked in after a year.\n\nAngela Rayner, deputy prime minister and champion of the bill, has told colleagues that the idea of improving workers’ rights is one of the Labour government’s few popular policies, and a key weapon in the party’s fight against Reform UK in working class seats.\n\n“The government is committed to implementing day one rights, ending insecurity, and strengthening the voice of working people,” said one ally of Rayner.",

    "blurb": "Companies have told chancellor that scaling back tax breaks on savings accounts could boost UK financial services",
    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Big City firms are urging Rachel Reeves to scale back tax breaks for cash Isas, a form of saving beloved by millions of Britons, in an effort to boost UK financial services and the economy by channelling money into stocks.\n\nCompanies including insurance group Phoenix and the London Stock Exchange Group have told the chancellor that almost £300bn held in cash Isas could generate better returns for savers if invested in stocks and shares, while supporting the City’s dwindling equities market.\n\nOne senior banker said the issue had been raised by several finance executives at a recent meeting with Reeves and that she had not rebuffed the idea.\n\n“The state should not be giving a tax break for us all to park our money in cash,” said Andy Briggs, chief executive of Phoenix, which operates the Standard Life brand.\n\n“I am hopeful that Rachel Reeves will conclude that it makes sense to refocus Isa tax incentives to make them consistent with the government’s very welcome growth agenda,” added Briggs, who was at the meeting.\n\nScrapping the cash Isa would be the biggest shake-up of the savings market since the products were first introduced by then-Labour chancellor Gordon Brown in 1999.\n\nCash Isas allow savers to earn tax-free interest on up to £20,000 a year and are by far the most popular of the UK’s Isas. Surveys show that many Britons prefer keeping wealth in cash rather than investing in the stock market because they view it as safer.\n\nOne Treasury official lobbied on scrapping cash Isas by City firms said “they also like the idea that it could provide growth for their asset management arms. They say there is a huge amount of capital that could be doing much more.”\n\nPeople close to the discussions said Reeves would be reluctant to change a popular form of savings, but the idea has not been ruled out.\n\n“They are quite important products for a lot of people so changing cash Isas would be quite a big deal,” said another official.\n\nThe UK offers several different Isas, including a product for cash and another for stocks and shares\n\nBut the financial services industry has raised concerns that cash Isas are housing money that could be earning more in London-listed companies while supporting the UK’s capital markets. Banks earn fees by helping companies sell shares to retail and institutional investors, while asset managers have suffered in recent years from investors pulling money from their UK equity funds.\n\nSteven Fine, chief executive of investment bank Peel Hunt, told the FT that he had “consistently been in touch” with the Treasury about Isa reform, “ideally to limit or remove cash, with the balance in London-listed stocks and shares.”\n\nAnother banker said that the government could limit the amount of cash held within an Isa, for example up to £5,000, while the remaining, larger portion could be held in stocks and shares.\n\nThe chair of a UK asset manager said the industry has been calling for Isa reform, noting that there should be “a single Isa, encouraging people to have more allocated into British stocks and shares.”\n\nThe Treasury said: “We want to help people save for their future goals and build greater financial resilience across the country. We keep all aspects of savings policy under review.”\n\nAccording to an LSEG spokesperson, the group was not at the meeting with Reeves where the topic of ISAs was discussed.\n\nAbout 14mn of the UK’s 22mn Isa holders held cash Isas alone, according to analysis of the most recent HM Revenue & Customs’ data, from 2021-22, by AJ Bell, a financial platform. Some 4.2mn investors held only stocks and shares Isas and 3.6mn had both cash and stocks and shares accounts.\n\nOf the £726bn held in adult Isas, £431bn is held in stocks and shares and the remainder is in cash Isas, according to AJ Bell’s analysis of HMRC data for 2022-23.",

It also prompted frustrated responses from those who were on deadline to file their self-assessment tax returns with HMRC and make payments.\n\n“We know some customers may be having issues trying to make a payment to HMRC ahead of the deadline for self-assessment tax returns. We’re in direct contact with HMRC, they are aware of the technical issues with our system and have confirmed today’s issues will not result in late-payment penalties, as they don’t apply until 1st March,” said a spokesperson for the bank.\n\n“We will ensure that no customer is left out of pocket because of delayed payments caused by this incident.”\n\nA status update on the Barclays website at the time of writing showed that seven functions were having difficulties, including debit cards and their messaging service. No clear guidance was available on when the systems will be up and running again.\n\nBarclays said earlier today that cards and cash withdrawals were working normally.

    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Almost one-tenth of England’s farmland will need to be converted to low-carbon use such as woodland or heath by 2050 in order for the country to hit its climate targets, according to government estimates published on Friday.\n\nAbout 760,000 hectares — or 9 per cent of England’s agricultural land — will need to “change away from agricultural land for environmental and climate benefits”, it said. A further 9 per cent will need to change to accommodate climate benefits, such as sustainable farming practices.\n\nThe National Farmers’ Union has warned that the sector is already being forced to scale back food production in favour of alternatives such as rewilding or growing crops for biofuels in order to keep their businesses viable.\n\nLosing additional farming land would also increase the UK’s dependence on imported foodstuffs.\n\nThe estimates were published as part of the government’s consultation into a long-awaited “land use framework” that aims to balance competing demands on England’s land, from housing and renewable energy to food production and nature restoration.\n\n“The primary purpose of farming will always be to produce the food that feeds the nation,” said environment secretary Steve Reed. He stressed that the framework would help decision makers protect “our highest quality agricultural land and make decisions about the long-term future of farm businesses”.\n\nAlongside the estimates, the government said that any impact on food production from the land use changes could be offset by using technology and sustainable farming techniques to increase crop yields.\n\nSuccessive governments have shied away from embarking on the framework over fears of the backlash it would receive from farmers.\n\nNFU president Tom Bradshaw said: “We must have a land use plan in place, underpinned by sound science and evidence, that has British food at its heart.”\n\nBut Victoria Vyvyan, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said it could mean farmers being told “what they are and aren’t allowed to grow, plant and rear on their land” and called for safeguards to prevent “mission creep” from officials.\n\n“Whenever the state gets involved, its tendency is to only become ever more prescriptive,” she added. “Today, the framework might be light touch, but tomorrow it won’t be.”\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, chair of the cross-party environment, food and rural affairs committee, said the framework was “long overdue”.\n\n“Farmers need to be able to plan ahead and they and other stakeholders have long called for clarity amidst a myriad of often conflicting demands,” he said.\n\nTwo-thirds of England’s land is agricultural, according to official statistics, with 38 per cent made up of arable land and 29 per cent grassland. The country’s population is predominantly urban, with 83 per cent of people living in built-up areas.\n\nEngland’s farmers are already under pressure from the impact of heavy flooding, high inflation and huge cuts to their subsidy payments.\n\nMany are also furious about the Labour government’s decision to overturn inheritance tax rules, which means some will be liable to pay tax on inherited agricultural and business assets that were previously exempt.\n\nFarmers also face a shift to a new post-Brexit subsidy scheme that offers them incentives to restore the natural environment, sometimes at the expense of food production.\n\nThe Environmental Land Management schemes, or ELMs, provide payments for farmers to adopt sustainable farming practices such as soil management, or to take land out of farming altogether. Scotland and Wales have separate devolved systems.\n\nThe schemes have been criticised by farming groups such as the NFU, which say farmers are being paid to inadvertently lower the country’s food production, despite the last government’s commitment to maintaining food self-sufficiency.\n\nThe sector had hoped that a land use framework would offer clarity about the intentions behind farming policy.\n\nDowning Street said: “It’s important to be clear that this isn’t about the government dictating how land is used, or taking valuable, productive land away from farms.\n\n“The government recognises that land is in high demand, and that is why we are starting a national conversation with those involved, whether it be landowners, farmers, developers and more, about how we use it to its full potential, not least for food production.”",

    "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer is using a long-standing statistical quirk to bolster his attempts to fend off Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs, relying on US data that shows the UK is one of the few major economies with which America has a trade surplus.\n\nBritish ministers are focusing on the US data in their discussions with officials in the Trump administration, because its methodology is more helpful to their cause than the UK’s own statistics.\n\n“Using America’s own trade data provides a shared and strong foundation when engaging in discussions with our American friends,” joked one senior British official.\n\nAccording to US figures, America ran an overall trade surplus with the UK in 2023, amounting to $14.5bn. That puts Britain in a favourable position as Trump threatens tariffs targeting countries with significant deficits.\n\nHowever, the Office for National Statistics reports that the UK ran a trade surplus with the US of £71.4bn, or around $89bn, in 2023.\n\nTrump has threatened punitive tariffs on countries with which the US runs trade deficits, though his focus appears to be goods rather than services.\n\nWhile the bulk of the UK trade balance with the US is services, in 2023, the country reported a small goods trade surplus with the US of about $3bn. This still contrasts with the $9.7bn goods trade surplus the US reports with the UK.\n\nStarmer and Lord Mandelson, the new UK ambassador to Washington, are arguing that Trump should spare Britain from any general application of tariffs given the trading position between the two countries.\n\nThe statistics offices across the Atlantic are aware of the differences and have been co-operating to realign the data since 2017. Both highlighted how the differences are larger when measuring trade in services.\n\nTrade asymmetries are common and differences “can be caused by a range of conceptual and measurement variations between the estimation practices of different countries,” warned the ONS.\n\nA key issue in the UK-US figures is the treatment of Crown Dependencies, the three offshore island territories in the British Islands that are self-governing possessions of the British Crown.\n\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis includes trade with Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man in the UK data, while the ONS does not.\n\nGiven that Jersey alone hosts over 35,000 financial firms managing more than £450bn in assets, this omission has a material impact.\n\nThe US reports exporting $4.8bn more in services to the UK than it imports, while the UK claims to export nearly £70bn more to the US than it imports.\n\nThe UK said the exclusion of the Crown Dependencies from the UK trade data is in line with the European System of Accounts.\n\nThe US Statistics Office said it “will explore the feasibility of modifying its data collection instruments to exclude these dependencies from its geographic definition of the United Kingdom”. This is something many UK officials might not want to happen just yet.\n\nAn analysis by HM Revenue & Customs into US-UK trade asymmetries on vehicles does seem to not settle the issue.\n\nBefore 2022, US-origin goods that cleared EU customs in another EU country before coming to the UK were counted as European imports. This makes it harder to compare with US data.\n\n“This explains the negative asymmetry,” the analysis stated.\n\nThe study refers to negative asymmetries when US exports of vehicles to the UK are larger than the corresponding UK imports from the US.\n\nFrom 2022, UK imports from the US on a country-of-origin basis should be comparable with US exports to the UK. “Instead, there is positive asymmetry in 2022, which cannot be explained,” concluded the analysis.",

    "blurb": "Spend or save is a tricky balancing act as we age",
    "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "After a lifetime of being a responsible saver, perhaps denying yourself luxuries in the pursuit of a comfortable retirement, your hard work has paid off. Your pension can provide a more than comfortable investment income. Plus, your calculations (often with the reassurance of a financial adviser) tell you that there’s no way you’ll run out of money. Yet spending still scares you.\n\nWhat’s the problem? It’s not maths, it’s psychology. And it can have a pernicious and damaging effect on the experience of retirement.\n\nFinancial advisers say navigating the change in mindset from saver to spender is a challenge many clients are unprepared for. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found around age 62, more than half of the sample have incomes higher than expenditure, and this figure increases to about 80 per cent by the end of retirement.\n\n“It is incredibly common to work with clients who have more than enough wealth to last them their lifetime, if not several, yet most feel at some level that they may still run out of money,” says Katherine Waller, co-founder of wealth manager Six Degrees.\n\nOne problem is the preconditioning that comes through a savings habit lasting 30 to 40 years. Dan Haylett, director of TFP Financial Planning, says: “We’re spoon fed saving and associate money in the bank with security. But in a modern retirement we need to flick the switch to spending.”\n\nAnother issue is that there are no retirement “role models” to learn from. People retiring now have a very different experience to that of their parents and grandparents. Someone with a defined benefit pension retiring 25 years ago went from a regular income through their work salary to another secure guaranteed (albeit lower) income through the pension scheme. “We’re now going from income, to no income and a pot of money that we have to deplete intentionally,” says Haylett. “Also, that’s a pot of money that gives us social status and a feeling of achievement. The sense of loss from spending it is huge in modern day retirement. People struggle with it.”\n\nVicky Reynal is a psychotherapist who focuses on people’s relationship with money. When it is hard to shift from saving to spending, she says it might be because saving was a psychological defence against negative feelings. “Changing our behaviour could leave us feeling too vulnerable or unable to manage the emotions that emerge as we try to spend our hard-earned money,” she says.\n\nMost experts cite childhood as a key influence. It doesn’t matter how old we are, our spending is still influenced hugely by what we’ve observed when growing up. Haylett says: “There’s no blueprint if you look to parents or grandparents. For them, frugality was a badge of honour.”\n\nIn the worst cases, the emotions preventing spending may be strong feelings of anxiety and fear. “Some people . . . cling anxiously to every penny just in case a catastrophic — and unrealistic — series of events could materialise,” says Reynal. “Spending threatens a sense of security and evokes almost primal fears.”\n\nAt the same time, people often overestimate how long they’ll live, says Haylett. “If you’ve had four aunts live to 101, I get it. But not many people know someone aged 100. I think the idea of a 100-year life is completely ruining people’s retirement.”\n\nIn the UK, people aged 65 can expect to live on average a further 19.7 years for men and 22.0 years for women, according to ONS data. This is projected to rise to 21.9 years for males and 24.1 years for females aged 65 years in 2045.\n\nOne way is to think of money left behind after death as a “lost opportunity”. Haylett says: “If I fast forward 20-30 years and you still have 70 per cent of your net wealth on the table, people say it feels stupid and they have missed out.” The potential for the government to tax it at the end is another incentive to spend and enjoy it now.\n\nBut the balance is difficult to get right, especially since advisers disagree on whether retirement spending should follow a U-shaped path or a straight line.\n\nMany advisers talk about the three phases of a 30-year retirement, roughly divided into 10 years each. First is “go-go”, when people have lots of energy and may want to explore the world and spend money. Then comes “slow-go”, when spending slows. Finally, they enter the “no-go”, or resting years, when health may be poor. Spending is higher at the start and at the end too, if long-term care is needed.\n\nThe prospect of a large care bill at the end of life is what most people’s anxiety centres around. “People usually want a back-up plan in place,” says Waller.\n\nThis is often your housing wealth. But it might also include gifting to family in tiers, holding some gifts back for later in retirement. Or using a gift and loan trust, where you can have access to the capital, but won’t benefit from any investment growth.\n\nAnalysis by Interactive Investor, an investment platform, shows that someone living until age 100 could need an extra £260,000 pension wealth to give them a comfortable retirement, compared with someone who lives until 83 years old. The average nursing home costs around £61,000 each year, so two years in a care home could cost around £122,000.\n\nDoug Brodie, founder and chief executive of Chancery Lane Retirement Income Planning, disputes the fact that spending is higher at the start of retirement. While some of his clients plan to spend an extra £10,000 to £20,000 a year on holidays in the early years of retirement, he says in every single case he’s found they don’t. He puts this down to lifestyle being fixed by the time they reach retirement. “If you have all the time on your hands, would you go and spend a week living in a fancy hotel in Paris? Most people say ‘that’s not the lifestyle that makes me feel comfortable.’ You’ve spent 40 years embedding your lifestyle with kids, family and local relationships.”\n\nMore often than not, Reynal says the feeling evoked around spending is guilt, either over its profligacy or the fact that money spent on themselves will reduce the amount their children inherit. “Sometimes it’s the guilt of not having been better parents emotionally,” she says.\n\nAll advisers agree that it’s important to try to identify these unconscious discomforts — and this can be done in conversation with family or a trusted adviser. “Talking can be emotive but writing it down or seeing it in writing can be different,” says Waller.\n\nMoira O’Neill is a freelance money and investment writer.

    "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "For years, “spend your pension last” was the financial planning mantra recited by wealth managers. Following the Budget in October, this has changed to “spend your pension before Rachel Reeves does.”\n\nInheritance tax will be extended to unspent pension pots from 2027 — prompting the well-advised wealthy to have a radical rethink of their retirement plans. Whether retirees opt to take money out of pensions and spend it, gift it to the next generation or leave it where it is, it is set to be a “gold mine” for the Treasury, generating £40bn in additional taxes over the next two decades, according to former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb.\n\nThis will be music to the ears of whoever might be chancellor by the year 2030 (I bet it won’t be Reeves) when tax revenues from this change are predicted to accelerate. But could behavioural changes offer a near-term boost for the property market and the consumer economy?\n\nWebb is well placed to calculate the potential upside. Now a partner at consultancy LCP, he has based his estimate on the huge number of final salary pensions that were transferred out of defined benefit schemes between 2015-2020, typically by men in their late 50s working for blue-chip companies.\n\nThe era of ultra-low interest rates ensured high transfer values, tempting over 100,000 retirees to trade the security of an income that would die with them for a more flexible investment pot they could pass to their heirs free of IHT (and in some cases, free of income tax) — until now.\n\nSpouses and civil partners aside, from 2027 anyone inheriting a pension pot could have to pay IHT and income tax at their highest marginal rate. To avoid this “double taxation”, financial advisers and their clients are weighing up the merits of upping pension withdrawals. These would be subject to income tax, but prudent use of gifting allowances (including the so-called “seven year rule”) could lessen IHT liability, or remove it altogether.\n\nGifting property deposits to children or grandchildren will be the first thought for many. Last year, the bank of mum and dad spent £9.2bn supporting 335,000 house purchases in the UK, according to Legal & General, with almost half of buyers under 35 receiving family assistance. If this ratio rises as Reeves tweaks mortgage affordability for first-time buyers, it could boost property prices and stamp duty revenues.\n\nDavid Hearne, a chartered financial planner at FPP, says the measures will reshape the great generational wealth transfer. Many of his clients are now considering making regular pension withdrawals (incurring income tax on the way out) and funding pension contributions for their adult children, who will receive tax relief and employer contributions on the way in.\n\nHe predicts equity release to extract value from the family home will be a popular tool. Money taken that way can be spent or gifted, with debts reducing the value of the estate and lessening the sting of IHT bills.\n\nTo encourage wealthy retirees to spend and enjoy their money, Hearne keeps a big reel of 40-per-cent-off stickers on his desk as a conversation starter. “Spending £20,000 on the trip of a lifetime could be seen as only costing £12,000 as the money won’t be subject to 40 per cent IHT when you die,” he says.\n\nAs advisers and their clients rejig plans, could this pulling forward of spending help to turbo-charge VAT receipts and boost the lacklustre UK economy?\n\nDespite LCP’s punchy predictions, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, has doubts. “It’s not a huge difference for the overall economy”, he says, “although it could be for individuals or their heirs.”\n\nMuch will come down to timing. If retirees pull more out of pension pots sooner than expected, this will reduce their spending power in later years. And while the wealthiest can spend (or gift) with confidence, the biggest worry for those less affluent is balancing investment risk against longevity risk.\n\nThose in my own circle who netted tidy sums by transferring their defined benefit pension into a Sipp have had a nerve-racking week as DeepSeek roiled global stock markets.\n\nRun down the pension too much, and they risk running out of money in retirement. Plus, they will have given up any spousal benefits in their defined benefit scheme and will need to provide enough for a surviving partner. This, and the lottery of care costs, could be a brake on spending and gifting.\n\nDifficult choices lie ahead. But with more than half of all those retiring between now and 2060 forecast not to be saving anywhere near enough, these are nice problems to have.\n\nClaer Barrett is the FT’s consumer editor and author of the FT’s Sort Your Financial Life Out newsletter series; claer.barrett@ft.com; Instagram and TikTok @ClaerB\n\nclaer.barrett@ft.com",

    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Mercurial Donald Trump may be, but he has a gift for shifting the debate. And sometimes, he is right. When it comes to defence spending, the only surprise is how long Europe’s Nato members have managed to freeride on American taxpayers.\n\nEurope is rearming, and not only because of the fear that Trump will call for members to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence at Nato’s June summit. Russia’s nuclear rhetoric, cyber attacks, the sabotage of undersea cables in the Baltic Sea and China’s vast new military command centre demonstrate that, as Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, said last year, “the world has got rougher”.\n\nRussia’s neighbours have been upping their game for some time. Poland’s military outlay is already 4 per cent of GDP and its armed forces are now the third biggest in Nato. In Sweden, every household recently received a government leaflet, “In Case of Crisis or War”, advising on emergency evacuation and how to store food if power fails.\n\nIn Britain, the threat still feels remote. The government refuses to say when it will meet its target of raising defence spending from 2.3 per cent to 2.5 per cent, fearing unpopular deep cuts elsewhere. But time is not on its side.\n\nThe UK still has a good story to tell. Our special forces, our intelligence services and our nuclear deterrent are a strong card for London in its relationships with Brussels and Washington. We play a leadership role in the Joint Expeditionary Force of northern and eastern European Nato members, we provide nuclear attack submarines to Australia through the Aukus partnership with the US and we are part of the Global Combat Air Partnership to build a next-generation warplane, with Italy and Japan.\n\nWithout commensurate funding, however, these involvements accelerate overstretch. Defence experts repeat the phrase “hollowed out”. Britain is relying on shiny totemic kit — its aircraft carriers and Trident — to project a level of underlying muscle that it no longer has.\n\nEven the 2.3 per cent is not quite what it seems, since it includes pensions. New “hunter killer” submarines have been stuck in port because of a lack of repair docks. General Sir Patrick Sanders, former chief of the general staff, has warned that Britain is no longer capable of launching the kind of operation it did in southern Iraq in 2003. The defence select committee complained a year ago that it could not even adequately judge Britain’s readiness, because the Ministry of Defence is so much more secretive than Nato allies.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is waiting for the strategic defence review in the spring. The reviewers include Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser once described by Trump as “a deep state stiff with a nice accent” (she hails from County Durham). Hill knows better than most that Trump takes a maximalist position. Her memoir quotes the president, in his first term, complaining that advisers who criticised his threats to leave Nato were “ruining my leverage”.\n\nBut even if Trump settles for more like 3.5 per cent, the UK is still in a fix. Starmer needs to decide, now, what spending envelope to give the reviewers. Some Labour backbenchers have warned that dithering is a grave mistake. Not all MPs or voters would support cutting transport, say, to fund defence. But few would want to see Britain let down Ukraine, after all we have done.\n\nBritain now faces an existential question: are we going to remain a serious player or be exposed as a Potemkin power, talking a big game while resources dwindle? There is always disagreement behind the scenes on whether we should be fighting “the last war” or the next one. But the experience in Ukraine suggests winning requires both cutting-edge technology and conventional weapons, not one or the other. And that mass matters: in terms of troops, tanks and artillery. The ceasefire envisaged by Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, is likely to require America’s European allies to help maintain a frozen zone between Ukraine and Russia, perhaps for some time.\n\nThere are always tensions, too, between the different armed services. But without a bigger fiscal envelope, it is unlikely that Britain can continue to be a serious player on both land and sea.\n\nThe fiscal constraints make this a hellish situation for the government. Chancellor Rachel Reeves didn’t mention defence this week in her speech on growth, but it is a core part of the industrial strategy, and rightly so. Although the ministry of defence does not publish a complete analysis of where it sources weaponry, we know that parts of the F-35 fighter jets are being made here. The Typhoon weapons system, according to BAE Systems, has contributed £1.4bn to the UK economy in export sales. The industry supports an ecosystem of suppliers which contribute to regeneration.\n\nBehind the scenes, there has been lobbying for both London and Brussels to exempt defence from fiscal rules on national security grounds — this seems unlikely to appeal to Reeves.\n\nBut there is yet another challenge brewing, from calls to boycott the defence industry. In 2020, the Supreme Court over-ruled the then Conservative government’s attempts to stop the Local Government Pension Scheme divesting from defence, after an action brought by the Palestine Solidarity campaign. A number of local authorities have dumped defence stocks.\n\nSuccessive governments have performed a delicate dance of the veils on defence, trying to maintain prestige while fudging resources. But now the music has stopped. The decision that Reeves and Starmer make in the coming months will have an impact on the UK’s alliances, our perceived position in the world, and our perception of ourselves.\n\ncamilla.cavendish@ft.com",

    "blurb": "The industry, which has attracted lots of private equity investment, is becoming increasingly punitive",
    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Parking in the UK has become a major annoyance for drivers. There are the fiddly apps, the cashless machines that never seem to work and the ever-increasing rates. Fall foul of the rules and you can expect a parking charge notice to be posted through your door within days.\n\nMotorists have taken to online message boards to rail against what they see as profiteering, alleging unfair fees, confusing signage and heavy-handed enforcement, with many believing the process has become more vindictive in recent years.\n\nDrivers are certainly getting more fines. In the 2023-24 tax year, private car park operators handed out a record near-13mn parking charge notices. In the six months to last October, they were being issued at a rate of one every two seconds.\n\nPrivate parking companies have grown rapidly over the past decade and now manage more than 50,000 sites across the UK, up fivefold from 2012, according to the International Parking Community (IPC), a trade body. Over the same period, penalty ticket issuance has skyrocketed, rising more than eightfold.\n\nOperators say their growth has been commensurate with a rise in demand for parking spaces and an increase in the number of people repeatedly flouting the rules.\n\nWill Hurley, chief executive of the IPC, is keen to point out that most people pay for their parking without incident — 99.77 per cent of “parking events” are “seamless”, he says. “It’s absolutely right that we look to improve,” he adds, “but unfortunately the sector only gets talked about when something goes wrong.”\n\nNevertheless, it’s a sector that has enjoyed bumper profits recently. Seven of the UK’s top 10 largest private car park operators have brought in record operating profits in the last three years, according to a Financial Times analysis of Companies House filings.\n\nThe industry has also undergone significant change. A wave of takeovers since 2017 has brought most of the biggest players under the ultimate ownership of private equity groups such as Wall Street behemoth KKR.\n\nHurley claims that, across the industry, the money from “paid-for parking” far exceeds that from “enforcement”. That isn’t true of every car park operator. In its latest accounts, ParkingEye, the fifth-largest operator by revenue, claims it earns most of its turnover “from the issue of parking charge notices”. Smart Parking, the UK’s 11th largest car park operator, earned almost 90 per cent of its global revenue last year — the majority of which originated in the UK — from issuing penalty tickets, according to its 2024 annual report.\n\nMost of the top 10 did not respond when contacted by the FT. National Car Parks, the largest operator, declined to comment and Q-Park, the second largest, says it operates barriered facilities and does not issue parking tickets. Apcoa says the “vast majority” of its income is “derived from client management fees where we do not take a share from parking/penalty charge notices”. (Creative Car Park, NCP and Q-Park have not achieved record profits in the past three years.)\n\nAlthough often described as parking “fines”, the tickets issued by private companies are technically parking charge notices, invoices that allege a motorist breached the contract to which they implicitly agreed by parking on private land.\n\nOnly local authorities can issue fines, says Scott Dixon, a consumer advocate and founder of The Complaints Resolver blog. Parking charge notices often “look the same [as local authority tickets] and that [means] most motorists see them as fines to pay off as soon as possible,” he explains.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of paid parking charge notices are settled soon after they are issued, according to a submission to parliament by Euro Car Parks. Those who have paid the charges generally aren’t allowed to appeal them subsequently.\n\nParking companies can obtain car owners’ details from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which sells them on request to approved members of the parking industry’s two trade associations — the British Parking Association and the IPC. Last year, the DVLA netted at least £31.9mn from the practice. The RAC Foundation, a think-tank, uses the number of vehicle keeper requests made by car park management companies as a proxy for the number of penalty tickets issued — and FT Money has done the same.\n\nSo how did we get here? Many consider the original sin to be the ban on vehicle clamping on private land, introduced by the government in 2012.\n\nAccording to Hurley, the lack of deterrent resulted in many more people breaking the rules. Others disagree.\n\nSteve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, says: “What no one foresaw [in 2012] was the scale at which parking firms would subsequently go after registered keepers. A big part of the issue is that cheap camera technology and ready access to DVLA data means pursuing car owners to ‘enforce’ parking offences is less expensive than driving around to apply wheel clamps used to be.”\n\nThere have been numerous calls for reform. In 2022, the government attempted to regulate the industry and impose a £50 cap on most charges. That year, car park operators launched multiple legal challenges, leading the government to withdraw its proposals.\n\nLast October, the industry set up its own code of conduct and in January 2025 formed a new panel — that it claims is independent — to oversee it.\n\nHurley, whose IPC organisation was not involved in 2022’s legal challenges, says: “What I want to achieve is for people to read the signage, follow the signage and then avoid a parking charge, because ultimately it’s really easy not to get a parking charge if you’re told how to avoid it.”\n\nThe first item on the new panel’s agenda was to stop motorists being penalised for taking more than five minutes to pay for parking.\n\nIn December, Excel Parking dropped its court claim against Rosey Hudson, a 31-year old from Leicestershire, whom it had charged nearly £2,000 in accumulated penalty tickets. Her case, disputed by Excel, was that she was delayed in paying for her parking on multiple occasions due to a poor mobile phone signal when trying to use the car park’s app.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2024, Excel Parking tripled its operating profits to £5.1mn and last year its operating margin stood at 28 per cent, the highest level since it started filing public accounts. Owner and founder Simon Renshaw-Smith was paid a dividend of £522,000 last year on top of at least £150,000 for his role as a director. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExcel has nearly halved its headcount since 2017 and slashed its wage bill by over a third, according to its 2024 annual report.\n\n“We need parking to support our high streets, towns and city centres, but something is clearly going wrong,” says Catherine Atkinson, the Labour MP for Derby North, who has raised the issue of unfair parking charges in parliament.\n\nShe says that many of her constituents paid for parking but had received parking charge notices for exceeding grace periods allowed by car park operators. “For a lot of people, it’s been because they’ve been older or assisting others, or they’ve really struggled with [parking payment] apps and broken machines.”\n\nAtkinson called for “an independently set code of practice” and says she will broach the subject with parking executives at a roundtable in February.\n\nBack when the government tried to set new rules for the sector, parking companies made the argument that a full impact assessment had not been carried out. A survey by audit firm Mazars on behalf of the BPA argued that the government’s fee caps would bankrupt almost half of private car park operators affiliated with the trade body within a year.\n\nSpeaking to MPs in 2021, Philip Boynes, chief executive of ParkingEye, said the drop in revenues resulting from the changes would be “unsustainable” without significant cost-cutting and job losses.\n\nBoynes told the MPs that the “average profit of a car parking operator was about 2.1 per cent”, citing a report by IbisWorld.\n\nThe FT’s analysis shows that ParkingEye’s operating margin that year was 15 per cent, up from 5 per cent in 2020. From 2015 onwards, aside from the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, the company’s margins have remained above 20 per cent.\n\nBoynes did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nParkingEye issued roughly one in five of all UK parking charge notices last year. It is owned by the world’s largest infrastructure investor, Macquarie, which previously owned distressed utility provider Thames Water. ParkingEye manages car parks for clients ranging from McDonald’s to the NHS.\n\nIn 2023 the company made an operating profit of £15.5mn from revenues of £57.5mn — a margin of 27 per cent.\n\nParkingEye says it “operates responsibly and fairly”. The company adds its growth has “been in response to the increase in demand [from] landowners who wish to ensure an increasing motorist population can access [facilities] that might otherwise become congested by non-compliant motorists who misuse the parking facilities”.\n\nThe industry’s own code of conduct, which came into effect last year, was largely similar to the government’s original, but omitted the proposed £50 cap on parking charge notices and restrictions on debt recovery fees.\n\nAt the time, the RAC Foundation said the industry’s code “conveniently avoided some of the biggest issues [that] badly need[ed] to be addressed to prevent drivers being taken advantage of.”\n\nSir Greg Knight, the former Conservative MP who introduced legislation to regulate the sector, is urging the new government to “take up the gauntlet” and introduce a “national parking code”.\n\n“The present situation is highly unsatisfactory; parking companies are in effect policing their own rules,” he says. “The threat of legal action was unfortunate, but the government appears to have let this matter drift.”\n\nThe government says it is “determined” to protect motorists and “drive up standards in the industry”. It adds that it will “set out further details on the private parking code of practice as soon as possible”.\n\n“In my book, this is unfinished business,” says Knight.\n\nAdditional reporting by Alistair Gray.

    "blurb": "In a matrix of climate, housing and energy crises, managing Europe’s oldest housing stock grows ever more complex. What does protecting historic homes mean? And how do we balance responsibility for the past with the needs of the future? ",
    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "I live in a Grade II-listed house in a historically important, but somewhat down-at-heel town on the UK’s east coast. I love it; it has sash windows, a little cast-iron boot scraper set into the wall next to the front door, and someone’s name scratched on to the rear window in a 19th-century cursive. But it is hard to keep warm, and when we first moved in the roof leaked. Living in a heritage property means a responsibility to look after a piece of architectural history. But it’s a privilege that occasionally feels like a Kafka-esque nightmare.\n\nWe had to apply for permission to overhaul our leaky roof. The local heritage officer initially suggested that repairs would not be permitted, as our home would no longer be in keeping with the rest of the terrace: presumably because it would not be leaking. Thankfully, the local planning officer overruled, seeing that repairs would help keep the house standing.\n\nToday, as the country’s housing, energy and climate crises reshape the way we inhabit and think about properties, the question of how to manage the country’s historic buildings is more complex than ever. What does conservation mean in a matrix of crises? And how do we balance responsibility for the past with the needs of the future?\n\nBritain has the oldest housing stock in Europe. In England alone, around 20 per cent of all housing was built before 1919, and more than 400,000 buildings are on a protected conservation list due to their architectural and historical significance. While housing on this list makes up only about 2 per cent of the country’s housing stock, 2.8mn homes are within conservation areas with a separate, additional set of rules for how to look after them. For many, it can be very hard to make — often urgently needed — changes to your home.\n\nAnd they are needed. A 2020 survey by Tado found that a UK home with an indoor temperature of 20C and an outside temperature of 0C, loses on average 3C after five hours, three times more than the average German home. Continued reliance on gas boilers not only makes homeowners particularly sensitive to price spikes or supply interruptions, but makes meeting the UK’s 2050 net zero climate targets incredibly challenging.\n\nThe system of “listing” buildings in the UK was started by the government during the second world war, so that churches and other important, mostly pre-1750, buildings could be monitored for damage. The list was drawn up by 300 architects. In 1947, the Town and Country Planning Act gave statutory power to the list. The late 1960s saw its first survey completed, and then another in the 1980s. Today, government body Historic England’s listed buildings can be Grade II, II* or I, with Grade I designating a building “of exceptional interest”. Inclusions range from landmarks such as London Bridge to a 19th-century urinal in Westminster.\n\nBut beyond these more systematic efforts, the expansion and management of what counts as a heritage building has been more piecemeal. In 2019, Historic England published a report by Matthew Saunders, former secretary of the Ancient Monuments Society, who had been commissioned to review the system. He acknowledged the “vital role of listing in protecting this country’s architectural heritage” but described the uneven coverage and detail in the listings in terms of geography, architectural style and time period. “Examples of the deficiencies are legion,” he wrote.\n\nSo what purpose does listing serve today? And who decides whether a building should be protected? And what does “protected” mean?\n\nIan Morrison, the director of policy and evidence at Historic England, emphasises that the body is not about preservation but conservation: “It is about making sure we manage change sensitively.” The body makes decisions about which buildings are added to the list. But the final decision lies with the secretary of state. A common misconception is that Historic England approves or denies applications for improvements or repairs; this is in the hands of local planning authorities: bodies that are increasingly under-resourced.\n\nHistoric England’s own survey of local authorities in a 2024 report reveals the extent of the resourcing crisis: between 2006 and 2018 the number of archaeologists and conservation specialists working for local authorities decreased by 35 per cent and the spending on heritage-related development control by 57 per cent.\n\nWhile for some, owning a listed building can seem like a nightmare of bureaucracy and expense, for others it carries a cultural cachet. There is a healthy market for architecturally important and historical houses, although in most cases both purchase and maintenance come with a premium. Academic and architecture critic Matthew Lloyd Roberts described the dilemma as simply a question of “How much money are you going to spend to improve the comfort and retain the aesthetics of your listed house?”\n\n“Having a listed status doesn’t put buyers off,” argues Georgia Grunfeld, acting head of appraisals for specialist estate agencies The Modern House and Inigo. Opportunities for sensitive renovations can be a selling point: “These houses are often appreciated for lower carbon footprint repairs too,” says Grunfeld. “Vernacular building materials, like traditional lime render and paint, wool insulation etc, can often be sourced in surprising proximity.”\n\nIn the context of both the climate and housing crises, there are some bigger questions to ask about the importance of building conservation. While the number of listed houses is relatively small, it draws attention to the wider value of reusing and adapting existing buildings.\n\nThe best way to conserve historic buildings is to adapt them and keep them in use, says Rachael Owens from the National Retrofit Hub: “The risk is that buildings fall into a state of disrepair and they then need even more work doing to them . . .[but] if we don’t do this work, people won’t be able to live in these buildings.” Most listed houses are maintained by their occupiers rather than heritage bodies: Morrison says that Historic England is trying to avoid “an environment whereby it is too difficult for people, then historic buildings become less attractive. Obsolescence is the thing we need to avoid the most.”\n\nIn February last year, 59 per cent of local authorities told Historic England they were seeing an increase in retrofit casework relating to historic buildings in the past year. In a separate survey, more than half of people living in historic buildings told Historic England they were planning a project to adapt their home to improve energy efficiency in the future. Historic England has provided the public with resources intended to make this process easier on the Your Home section of its website. It makes the case that if “properly designed and maintained”, heritage buildings can provide better energy efficiency than many would expect, because they are “designed to work with their environment”.\n\nThere is much innovative work being done to adapt historic buildings for the present day. Two of the winners of Architects’ Journal’s 2024 Retrofit & Reuse Awards stand out. Led by specialist firm SPASE Design, Grade I-listed Athelhampton House was turned from a leaky kerosene and oil-fuelled stately home into a building with zero energy bills. Sensitively integrated breathable insulation in the floors and ceilings helped, but most was achieved through the installation of air-source heat pumps, solar panel arrays and battery storage. Of course, this is only possible if you have the land and capital to accommodate this scale of renewable energy generation — and the ancient yew hedges to hide it all behind.\n\nThe Old Chapel presents a very different approach. Here Tuckey Design Studio recycled materials from the site and elsewhere including reclaimed timber and terracotta tiles to reduce waste and opened up the building to promote circulation and natural ventilation. It encapsulates a “fascinating dialogue between old and new, maintaining the rich patina and history of a place in preparation for a new purpose,” says project lead Elena Aleksandrov. But again, these kinds of projects are not always an option for many people’s budgets.\n\nHistoric England says it wants to remove some of the additional fear and cost about modernising. In 2024 it released an advice note setting out best practice for the adaptation of historic homes, designed to support local authorities in making decisions that balance heritage and environmental impact.\n\nAnd historic buildings do not need to be handled with kid gloves, says Anna Hollyman, co-head of the Regenerative Places Programme at the UK Green Buildings Council (UKGBC). Those that survive tend to be robust. “Because of this they can be moulded and remoulded: basically the epitome of ‘long life loose fit’”. The phrase comes from a prescient speech made by Alex Gordon, then president of RIBA, in 1972. He proposed that good architecture is designed to be later adapted. This important principle today is encouraged by bodies such as UKGBC, which advocates for conserving and adapting buildings to prevent unnecessary damage to the environment.\n\nSaunders writes in his 2019 report that “historic buildings and monuments . . . do as much to define this country as its democracy and language”. But which buildings are deemed architecturally significant enough to be worth protecting is as contentious an issue as how they are protected.\n\nSocial housing has been a flashpoint for debates about the listing system in recent decades, says architecture critic Owen Hatherley. Take the Park Hill estate in Sheffield, a Modernist building that became Grade II*-listed in 1998. A rare modern addition to the list, the development was completed in 1961 and is an internationally important example of the “streets-in-the-sky” style of architecture, with wide decks connecting flats at the upper levels. But despite the high level of protection afforded by the listing, the local planning authority approved plans that included the gutting of three flanks of the building for transformation into luxury apartments.\n\nFor Hatherley this plan meant “almost destroying the entire building — as if it were only the frame that was listed”. Historic England thinks differently, and holds up the Park Hill site as an exemplar project. “From our perspective, the buildings have been successfully repurposed without losing their primary architectural significance,” says Morrison.\n\nThe Twentieth Century Society argues that the listing criteria is not fit for purpose, because it favours older buildings over more recent ones: the government’s guidance on selection states that buildings less than 30 years old “are not normally considered to be of special architectural or historic interest because they have yet to stand the test of time”.\n\n“One big flaw in the current system is that there is no mechanism for looking at the buildings ‘coming of age’ each year,” says the society’s director Catherine Croft. According to her, the majority of cases in which a recommendation to list is overruled by the secretary of state are for postwar buildings, and these decisions are often “influenced by lobbying from owners and swayed by arguments which go beyond . . . architectural and historic value” — factors such as cost of redevelopment or local regeneration.\n\nHatherley critiques society’s broader approach to old buildings. The work at Park Hill, and the renovation of other notable social housing blocks, such as Ernő Goldfinger’s Trellick Tower, may preserve the building’s physical form, but they do not conserve their original purpose of providing housing for low-income families. Hatherley argues that if there were a choice between maintaining the use of a housing estate and protecting its architectural value, he would err towards the former: “At least it is doing this thing that we as a society need. But instead, it is decided that we need architectural trinkets.”\n\nWithin the heritage list there are curious inclusions that hint towards conservation that surpasses architectural value: Paul McCartney and John Lennon’s childhood homes, for example. McCartney’s is a modest 1949 council house of the quality that the postwar Labour government encouraged; Lennon’s a more middle-class dwelling built in 1933, an example of Arts & Crafts-influenced 1930s housing with lead casement windows. Neither would have been protected by a listing had it not been for their residents, but this good fortune means examples of more “ordinary” housing — arguably every bit as important to our social and architectural history as grand villas and churches — have been conserved.\n\nThe Beatles’ homes are examples of what Leanne Tritton, one of the founders of the campaign group Don’t Waste Buildings, called “journeymen buildings”. The group refocuses the question of conservation to something altogether more fundamental — waste. The thrust of its argument is that if Britain is to meet the 2050 net zero target, it cannot afford to knock down buildings. This is because of embodied carbon; the climate warming emissions that have already been expended in a building’s construction. The UK Green Building Council reports that 20 per cent of the carbon emissions attributed to the built environment in the UK come from embodied carbon.\n\nShould we, therefore, be more stringent with protections? Perhaps not on a basis of architectural merit but of environmental conservation. Demolishing a leaky old house and replacing it with a highly insulated one is not necessarily a net gain for the environment: the carbon emissions that went into the original building’s creation are essentially wasted.\n\n“Historic societies are really good at protecting historic buildings but Don’t Waste Buildings is about the unloved,” says Tritton. “It just makes no sense to pull them down unless you absolutely have to.” The Don’t Waste Buildings campaign presents a new way to approach old buildings which is at once more revolutionary and more pragmatic — it hopes — than the current one.\n\nWhen facing down the challenge of updating ageing housing stock, one could be forgiven for seeing the wealth of heritage buildings in Britain as a burden. Or protecting their architecture as an obstacle. But perhaps the answer lies in seeing the historic built environment as a starting point for modernisation: heritage not as holding back the future, but its foundation.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow @ft_houseandhome on Instagram",

    "body": "It’s a cold January afternoon in Kent, patches of snow still on the ground despite bright sunshine. On the North Downs Way, just outside Sevenoaks and 20 miles from the centre of London, a dog-walker pauses and steps to one side of the narrow, muddy path to make space for a group of young people coming the other way. But a strange thing happens. As the man and the dog wait, the people just keep coming — two or three abreast, all seemingly in their 20s, smiling and chatting animatedly as they pour out of the woods along the path, a gregarious Gen-Z column almost 400-people strong.\n\nThough he didn’t know it, the man was witnessing the latest outing of Overground, one of a new breed of walking groups that is taking an activity previously associated with sedate middle-age and reinventing it for a Gen-Z and millennial audience. Information is shared on TikTok and Instagram, and the groups often meet in the Home Counties or within a short train ride of other major cities.\n\nFor many of the organisers, it’s about building community, harnessing the mental-health benefits of spending time in nature, encouraging participation from under-represented groups and getting away from hectic city lives. And for an increasingly sober demographic, the early starts on weekend mornings are no problem.\n\nBefore starting their hiking group Dykes Who Hike in March 2024, neither Lucy Cooper nor Yas Message had been big hikers. “We wanted to see more of the countryside whilst making new connections. . . without relying on alcohol,” says Cooper.\n\nWhen the pair advertised their first hike on social media, the “Seven Sisters walk” from Seaford to Eastbourne, 60 people turned up. When 250 turned up for their second, they realised they might need to formalise a ticketing system to avoid hikes becoming “too intimidating for people to enjoy”. Tickets now cost £2, and all 200 spaces typically sell out in minutes; in the past year, new branches have sprouted in Manchester, Leeds, Shropshire and Birmingham.\n\nLast weekend I joined another new group, the Adventure Girls Club, meeting up with 12 women and two dogs at Bath station for a foray into the Downs. “The [traditional] hiking community can often focus on hiking the farthest, fastest or the most challenging route,” says the group’s founder Alice Keegan, “whereas I love to hike slowly, take in the views, notice the nature around me — a more mindful approach.”\n\nKeegan, a qualified mountain leader, used to live in London’s bustling Bethnal Green and work as creative director of a design agency catering to the music industry. Feeling burnt out, she took herself solo hiking in the Lake District and began to appreciate how beneficial the outdoors was for her mental health. Now she wants to support others to “escape the stress of modern living”.\n\nWe file out of town and wind up steep woodland footpaths towards Sham Castle, built in 1762 for Ralph Allen, one of the key figures in Bath’s Georgian revival. As we meander through Smallcombe Wood, Keegan points out species of fungi including the frills of a turkey tail, and the black bulbs of King Alfred’s cakes.\n\nBut if connecting with nature is a key obsession, it is the digital world that is enabling these new communities. Lauren La Faci, TikTok’s London-based consumer communications lead, says that “in recent months, hiking enthusiasts have been captivating millions with stunning landscapes and hiking tutorials”. On the platform, #hiking has 5mn posts (and #hiketok has 270,000). In comparison, #swimming manages 2.1mn posts.\n\nFor Jeb Jagne, who founded Overground in July 2023, “walking became a way of taking a breather and a way to decompress” after suffering a bereavement, relationship breakup and job loss within the course of a few months. Overground hosts monthly walks within an hour’s train journey of the capital. On their first, 43 people showed up; now there can be as many as 500.\n\nThe walks are free and non-ticketed which means the organisers can’t limit numbers. “There are already so many barriers when it comes to finding space in the outdoors, I wouldn’t want to introduce another one,” says Jagne. Overground is now fundraising to set up a training programme for people from marginalised groups to become mountain guides.\n\nJagne, who previously worked as a DJ and nightclub promoter, has been sober for the past year. “I’ve seen people meet at Overground and form solid friendships, move into new homes and even go on holiday together. The walks will always be our North Star but what really matters is being that first domino in forming a new connection.”\n\nBack in Bath, 13km trodden and legs aching, the Adventure Girls Club troops back to the train station. The group splits, exchanging social-media contacts and “nice to meet you’s”, returning to suburbia with new friendships forged — if a little muddier than four hours earlier.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning",

    "body": "Thanks to your generosity, the FT’s joint seasonal appeal in aid of Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign “FLIC” and school food charity Magic Breakfast has now reached its baseline target of raising £100,000.\n\nThe appeal, which was launched in early December, was due to close at the end of this week. But we are now extending the deadline by a week, until Friday February 7, thanks to a late intervention from the Rosetrees Trust, which has generously offered to match-fund donations to get us to a new £200,000 target.\n\nThe offer is only valuable if readers donate. So if you haven’t yet given, please do consider supporting our work at ft.com/donate. Individual and corporate donations alike will be enormously appreciated.\n\nProper nutrition via healthy breakfasts at school, such as those provided by Magic Breakfast, boosts the capacity of young people — many of whom would otherwise go hungry and struggle to concentrate — to learn.\n\nFLIC’s work boosts young people’s capacity to prosper in later life, thanks to the charity’s full school curriculum of core financial skills training.\n\nRichard Ross, chair of Rosetrees, said: “Ensuring children from deprived homes start the day with a proper meal is good for their health and gives them the best chance of learning at school. We are also supporting research that is looking at the mental health problems of young people, which [is] growing for a variety of reasons.” Financial stress, often compounded by gaps in foundational financial understanding, is a proven contributor to mental health problems.\n\nRoss, whose charity is a leading backer of “venture philanthropy” in the area of medical research, is convinced of the related relevance of the FT’s appeal and is a passionate advocate for a broader push to increase philanthropy. “People who are well provided [for] financially should contribute to the needs of others,” he said.\n\nRoss’s family fortune stems from his parents’ multiple business start-ups, which range from a market stall to a property investment empire. That wealth once topped £100mn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, but Ross has since given away a large portion of it. Medical research grants of more than £50mn have generated follow-on funding of £1.2bn, Ross said.\n\nThe trust’s match-funding offer to FLIC and Magic Breakfast was conditional on the appeal first reaching its original baseline target of £100,000. Notable donors to the appeal so far include Morgan Stanley International, as well as hundreds of FT readers.\n\nIn two months of appeal coverage of the work of FLIC and Magic Breakfast, as well as other organisations operating in related fields, the FT has reported on the growing realisation across the world — from Finland to Indonesia — that both nutritious food and financial education in schools can make a vast difference to future lives.",

    "body": "A large inheritance, warned Victorian novelist Charles Dickens, is one of man’s chief corrupters. Great Expectations is his cautionary tale, as sweet protagonist Pip, believing he is the sudden heir to a fortune, abandons his humility and life-long friends.\n\nIt’s an idea that holds little sway with most middle-class Britons today. But London-based Andy, 79, is not one of them. He and his wife do not plan to leave their four adult children an inheritance. Instead, the couple have spent what’s left of their funds, sailing and travelling the world before they “pop their clogs”.\n\n“For me, it’s about equality of opportunity and fairness. It seems unfair that some kids get huge assistance while others get nothing,” he says. “We’re arranging our finances so they have just enough to bury us.”\n\nAndy, who asked us not to use his surname, worked in public education and retired in his early 50s. He says he’s politically “leftwing-ish”, but his views aren’t just about politics — it’s also a question of parenting.\n\n“I don’t want to be a helicopter parent . . . I hate when I see kids who are 40 and their parents are still looking after them.”\n\nIt’s a noteworthy stance, given the monumental wealth transfer that’s expected globally over the next few decades. A record £5.5tn in wealth is due to be transferred to the next generation in the UK alone. With over 90 per cent of the country’s wealth currently held by Generations X and older, many Boomers and millennials are set to become “inheritance millionaires”.\n\nYet Andy is not entirely alone. In the US, a 2015 survey by HSBC found that one in four Americans planned to spend their money rather than pass it down, a phenomenon known as SKIs — “spending the kids’ inheritance”. A Hargreaves Lansdown survey in 2021 found around 11 per cent of parents in England choose not to leave an inheritance to their families. (In Scotland, there are “forced heirship” rules.)\n\nTheir motivations range from hedonism (wanting to spend the money themselves), not wanting to spoil their children, or philanthropy. Others — such as actor Daniel Craig — say they simply find the concept of an inheritance “distasteful”.\n\nI should mention here that my own parents also belong to this contrarian group. Since as early as I can remember, I’ve known they don’t believe in leaving a large inheritance — something my dad has spoken publicly about himself. They have instead pledged the overwhelming majority of their wealth to their charity, The Safer Roads Foundation, along with other humanitarian causes.\n\nThe Bank of Mum of Dad has taken excellent care of my sibling and me (including generously paying off our student loans, and allocating funds for a future deposit on a flat — both immense gifts, and more than many will receive in inheritance). So now, it’s pretty much closed for business.\n\nTo be clear, they haven’t cut us out in anger. Nor are they Marxists — politically they’re pretty centrist. They simply feel that there are life-saving causes that will benefit from their money more than their two well-educated adult children.\n\nRenaissance philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli once wrote that “A son can bear the loss of his father . . . but the loss of his inheritance may drive him to despair.” For anyone wondering if I’ve succumbed to despondency, fear not: I’m genuinely proud of my parents’ legacy. I feel incredibly fortunate for the support I’ve had during their lifetime. There’s a silver lining too, in that I won’t be at risk of any familial angst once they die (40 per cent of people report conflict over inheritances).\n\nIf anything, I’m intrigued as to why it’s so provocative, especially among their peers. On the rare occasions that it’s come up, I’ve encountered shock or thinly veiled criticism of my parents. Sometimes I’m met with reassurance that I am in fact in their will and this is a motivational ploy (I checked. If it is a bluff, they’re not breaking the act yet).\n\nAndy also says his friends have been critical of his stance. That’s despite all his children “landing on their feet.”\n\n“People are horrified,” he says. “That includes my well-balanced friends . . . They can’t understand it.”\n\nOnline forums froth with furious commentators wondering how people can “watch their kids living in a ‘hole’ while they go and enjoy their cruises.” Anonymous op-eds voice dismay over parents “selfishly” spending their inheritance. There is near delirium each time a member of the super-rich — including Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg — publicly vows not to leave their wealth to their offspring. Sure, there’s being charitable, they say, but to such extremes?\n\nFundamentally, wanting to shrink your children’s inheritance is seen as counter to the primitive desire to protect one’s offspring — no matter how well off they are. The majority of people are dedicated to hoarding for their family, with more than £100bn inherited and gifted in the UK alone each year, according to Demos, a think-tank.\n\n“Taking care of the kids is the cultural norm. So it’s countercultural if you will,” says psychology professor Janet Reibstein and author of Good Relations. “It’s seen as neglecting the natural role of parent and child.”\n\nIt’s a luxury itself to contemplate trimming your will, given many families are scared they won’t get a choice amid rising social costs. Fewer than 30 per cent of Brits expect to benefit — or have benefited from — an inheritance, according to a 2022 YouGov poll. The ONS reported that the median inheritance for those who received one was £11,000 (this excludes lifetime gifts), and on average occurs in one’s 60s.\n\nIndeed, political interventions that limit the wealth that’s passed down tend to spark controversy, including recent reforms to UK inheritance tax (IHT), often described as “Britain’s most hated tax”. Today, around 4 per cent of estates are affected by IHT — charged at 40 per cent on any part of an estate worth over £325,000 (or over £1mn when a main residence is passed down to children and reliefs are pooled with a spouse). The decision to include pension wealth within the scope of IHT from 2027 has come under fire from some corners of the media, while ending the exemption of agricultural property from IHT caused farmers to march on Downing Street.\n\nInheritance naysayers have a simple argument: lots of money isn’t always the best thing for us. It can damage people — and wealthy kids need specific guardrails, a theory exposed by the Carnegie Conjecture, which holds that people receiving a substantial inheritance are much more likely to leave the workforce. The party line is that guardrails are crucial, whether parents are handing over life-changing amounts or just a generous leftover that might ease their children’s paths.\n\nIn other words, it’s tough love.\n\nJoe Reilly, an adviser to US family offices and host of The Inheritance Podcast, says too much money is a real concern.\n\n“It’s a source of anxiety for parents, knowing their children are growing up in affluence . . . It can impede their search for internal meaning,” he says. “Wealth doesn’t have to deprive motivation, but getting rid of all the challenges does.”\n\nSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says hyper-successful entrepreneurs in particular want their children to make their own way (though this is softened with substantial gifts during their parents’ lifetime).\n\nPart of the issue, according to Reilly, is that inheritance was historically reserved for the aristocratic class, who would reserve “a lot of time and effort” learning to adapt to a big wealth influx, including focusing on public service — though many still squandered it. Today, inheritance comes to broad swaths of the middle class, who have little or no training.\n\nReceiving a hefty inheritance can come with real baggage, says author Eliza Filby. In her book, Inheritocracy she cites several examples of people who inherited large sums who felt guilt, and a loss of meaning. There’s a danger of “economically infantilising” your offspring too, she says, especially in light of the “nepo baby” debate.\n\nTo counter this, family office adviser Elena Nuñez Cooper works with clients to adopt a policy of “severe responsibility” with their children. This includes teaching them tough financial lessons from a young age and training them to be philanthropists. It also means managing rich people’s funds so they “die with zero”, with the majority allocated to a charitable foundation — ideally led by their conscientious, financially savvy children.\n\n“Kids do not benefit from an attitude of ‘you’re going to inherit later’,” Nuñez says. “I work with the children of billionaires who have everything, and they’re a lot worse off in the long run.”\n\nFor parents it can be a big ideological step to consider trimming their children’s or grandchildren’s inheritance instead of boosting it — even if they are well set up.\n\nIt’s perhaps an even tougher pill to swallow for the offspring expecting to receive a chunky inheritance, says financial psychotherapist Vicky Reynal. “We all have a normal amount of greed,” she says. “Most people want to be wealthier.”\n\nThe framing around cuts in inheritance is therefore key. This includes “highlighting that it has nothing to do with not loving or caring about them,” Reynal notes. Their responses may vary depending on the individual’s maturity and how early on these expectations are set.\n\nProfessor Reibstein goes further. She says that families where there’s little philanthropic precedent will need to work hard to rewrite their “culture” if they want to take this route — otherwise, “your children will feel it as a blow.”\n\nHargreaves Lansdown analyst Cooper stresses that it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Simply, leaving your kids everything doesn’t have to be the default.\n\n“You can think about giving them comfort without spoiling them,” she says. “There’s an element of adding to their quality of life versus taking away the impetus to work.”\n\nWhatever route you choose, however, experts agree: communicate your wishes early. Emotionally, being disinherited without being told can be devastating. But the other danger, Cooper says, is people can be in for a financial shock when an expected inheritance doesn’t materialise.\n\n“You absolutely cannot rely on an inheritance,” she warns.\n\nStill, it’s hard to escape the fact that for many an inheritance can make an outsized difference, especially in light of rising house prices — the average first-time buyer deposit in London is now over £140,000, according to Zoopla — and diminished pensions. That includes segments of the middle class, many of whom are poorer than their parents. Inheritance is bridging that intergenerational gap, says Filby.\n\n“Whether or not you’re from a wealthy family . . . [inheritance] is more important in determining your lifetime income than it has been in the past,” says David Sturrock at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nThe IFS forecasts inheritance will make up a record average 14 per cent of lifetime earnings for the 1980s-born generation. That means for some families, an inheritance will dictate whether they own a house, clear their debts, or can retire comfortably, Sturrock explains. In rare cases, it could be a pathway to social mobility.\n\nYet few born into the top quartile can make that argument. Statistically, most adult children in this camp will enter their 40s with a decent income and firmly on the housing ladder — often funded by historic parental gifts. A bulky inheritance in this group’s case has been described as insurance against calamity, or laziness.\n\nFor Andy, this is precisely the problem.\n\nHis advice is to think about inheritance as a sporting analogy. Imagine, he says, if there was a rule in F1 whereby if you won the first race, you’d do five fewer laps in the next race. You’d probably win again, and allowed five fewer laps again, and so on.\n\nThat’s what leaving an inheritance does to our society, he argues.\n\nI temper that people might struggle to take affirmative action when they see all the other kids getting to skip five laps. Isn’t it hard to make yours the odd ones out?\n\n“Well,” he laughs. “I just say, you should have brought them up better then.”",

The sector is reliant on overseas students who typically pay two or three times domestic rates.\n\nOfficial data shows a more than 50 per cent drop in new EU students after Brexit, while universities increased recruitment from other markets in Asia and Africa, including India, Nigeria and Pakistan.\n\nBoris Johnson promised in 2020 that his Brexit deal would not interrupt the “va-et-vient” of people-to-people contacts with the EU, but in practice the intake of UK universities has shifted substantially.\n\nJamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, which represents the industry, said the changes had brought greater diversity to British campuses, but had narrowed the field of subjects studied as international students tended to favour science and business studies courses.\n\n“While the diversity in terms of country of origin has changed, diversity in courses has been lost,” he added.\n\nBrexit also saw the introduction of a points-based immigration system by Johnson’s government from January 1 2021 that coincided with a massive expansion of the NHS workforce, necessitating far more overseas recruitment.\n\nMark Dayan, policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said that a government decision to lower thresholds for medical workers had led to a radical reshaping of the NHS workforce.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2023 the number of ethnic minority doctors in the NHS grew at almost 8 times the rate of white doctors, according to the General Medical Council, with arrivals from India, Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria and the Philippines rising sharply.\n\nDayan said the challenge of integrating doctors who trained overseas into the NHS was one reason why an increase in staff numbers in recent years had not delivered a commensurate increase in productivity.\n\n“Absorbing so many new staff, many at [the] start of their careers, who are used to a different system of working, requires a lot of work on training, and introducing them to how things are done in the NHS,” Dayan said.\n\nThe government is planning to train more UK doctors as well as continuing to recruit from abroad, but its red lines on free movement of workers mean that it is unlikely that EU-UK reset negotiations will see a significant increase in recruitment from the EU.\n\nBrexit was sold during the 2016 referendum campaign as the means by which the UK would “take back control” of its borders, curbing both legal and illegal migration.\n\nIn the event, both surged after 2020, fuelling accusations of betrayal on the political right and helping to drive support for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party, which has recently drawn level with both Labour and the Conservatives in the polls.\n\nThis political splintering is the opposite of what former Tory premier David Cameron intended when he called the referendum to head off the threat posed by Farage’s UK Independence Party and resolve long-standing divisions over Europe inside the Conservative party.\n\nBut Reform’s rise has come despite a decline in the overall popularity of Brexit, with 58 per cent of voters now saying Brexit was the wrong decision, according to polling by the National Centre for Social Research.\n\nA “key element” of this shift, according to pollster Sir John Curtice, is driven by demographic trends as older, pro-Brexit voters die off and younger voters, who were unable to vote in 2016, express their overwhelming pro-EU views.\n\n“If you look at the demographics story, the ceiling for a Farage party should be lower than 10 years ago, but Reform is more popular in 2024 than Ukip was in 2014,” said Rob Ford, professor of politics at Manchester University.\n\nFord credited this counter-intuitive outcome to the platform Brexit gave Farage, and to the political opportunity offered to him by the Tories’ struggle to deliver benefits from the UK’s break with the EU.\n\nThe past few years have laid bare Brexit’s damaging impact on business. Countries usually strike trade deals to reduce border bureaucracy, but the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement did the reverse, restoring the customs requirements that had disappeared with the advent of the EU single market.\n\nLabour has said it will not rejoin a customs union with the EU or go back into the EU single market, so trade will continue to face customs barriers.\n\nStarmer’s negotiations with the EU could reduce friction for some individual sectors, such as food and drink exporters, if Labour makes good on its promise to strike a veterinary agreement with Brussels.\n\nAligning industrial standards and relinking the EU and UK carbon trading schemes could also reduce other forms of red tape, such as licensing requirements and carbon border adjustment taxes, or CBAMs.\n\nHowever a mountain of paperwork will remain. In 2023, the last year for which data is available, there were more than 41mn customs declarations for trade between the UK and the EU. The much criticised Brussels red tape became ‘red white and blue’ tape.\n\nAs a result, UK goods exports underperformed other rich-world countries, with the total value rising by just 0.3 per cent per year, compared with 4.2 per cent annually across the OECD, according to the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank.\n\nNew Brexit red tape has hit small businesses hardest, with research by the London School of Economics calculating that 16,400 firms stopped exporting to the EU after the TCA came into force.\n\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce said smaller companies had less capacity to deal with “the deluge” of new bureaucracy, while larger businesses had the money and staff to adapt.\n\n“Exporting to the EU was often a gateway for SMEs to enter new export markets across the world, so the urgency of making border processes cheaper and simpler is clear,” he added.\n\nThe BCC has urged the government to use the reset negotiations to simplify border processes and promote regulatory co-operation on customs matters, particularly as the bloc introduces new rules in the coming years.\n\nChris Southworth, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce, said that given the UK’s red lines the government should invest in digitising trade, using AI and improving access to trade finance in order to help business.\n\n“You don’t need TCA for any of this and it will improve EU co-operation and repair some of the damage,” he added.\n\nPoll tracker by Jonathan Vincent",

    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "AstraZeneca has cancelled plans for a £450mn UK vaccine manufacturing plant after months of wrangling with British officials about state support for the project, in a major blow to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s government.\n\nUK officials put forward a revised offer of financial support for the site close to Liverpool this month that was significantly higher than the £40mn offered last year, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nStarmer’s Labour government had initially sought last summer to reduce the amount of public money provided to the project in Speke from about £90mn to £40mn.\n\n“Following protracted discussions with the government, we are no longer pursuing our planned investment at Speke,” AstraZeneca said in a statement on Friday.\n\n“Several factors have influenced this decision including the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government’s proposal.”\n\nThe new plant was going to make the next generation of flu vaccines and help the UK be more resilient in future pandemics.\n\nThe existing Speke site will continue to produce and supply a flu vaccine, said AstraZeneca, the largest UK-listed company by market capitalisation.\n\nThe decision comes just days after chancellor Rachel Reeves sought to position the UK as a highly attractive place for life science companies to invest in a major speech on growth.\n\nStarmer and Reeves have faced criticism from business for their £40bn tax-raising Budget last year and other measures including stronger worker rights, which executives have warned will make the UK a less attractive place to invest.\n\nThe UK’s previous offer to the pharmaceutical group under former Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt included up to £70mn in grants to develop an existing AstraZeneca vaccine facility at Speke, as well as £20mn in research and development support from the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nHunt, who announced the deal to great fanfare in March of last year, told the Financial Times that AstraZeneca’s decision was a “massive own goal by the government”.\n\n“Manufacturing high-end vaccines is a huge opportunity for us to move away from over-dependence on the R&D part of the value chain,” he said. “I intervened personally to get this deal over the line in 2023 and am mortified the government has dropped the ball on it.”\n\nThe Treasury said: “A change in the make-up of the investment originally proposed by AstraZeneca led to a reduced government grant offer being put forward. All government grant funding has to demonstrate value for the taxpayer and unfortunately, despite extensive work from government officials, it has not been possible to achieve a solution.”\n\nIt added: “AstraZeneca remains closely engaged with the government’s work to develop our new industrial strategy.”\n\nOne person with knowledge of the relationship said that AstraZeneca had become “deeply frustrated” with the government, with Speke just one point of tension in a wider industry clash over drug prices and the future of life sciences investment.\n\nPeople close to the pharmaceuticals group said it was looking at other possible international manufacturing sites for its new vaccine plant now that it has abandoned the Speke plan.\n\nA person close to AstraZeneca said the company could look to relocate the project to Philadelphia where it already manufactures the company’s nasal vaccine for influenza.\n\nIn November, AstraZeneca said it planned to invest $3.5bn in research and development and manufacturing in the US, the world’s largest pharmaceutical market, which generates 44 per cent of the company’s sales.\n\nAstraZeneca’s chief executive Pascal Soriot said at the time that the investment reflected “the attractiveness of the business environment together with the quality of talent and innovation capabilities”.\n\nThe company is also planning a $1.5bn manufacturing facility in Singapore, and last week pledged a $560mn investment in Canada.\n\nPeople with knowledge of the business said its decision on the Speke facility would not affect any of AstraZeneca’s other investments in the UK.\n\nThe Speke decision comes at a time when the US is offering very attractive perks to companies planning to invest in manufacturing, including through state infrastructure investment, and loans and grants for research and development.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called on “every business in the world” to “come make your product in America”.\n\n“We will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth,” Trump said in a video stream at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. “But if you don’t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff.”\n\nTrump has said he wants to cut corporation tax from 21 per cent to 15 per cent.",

    "blurb": "Benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 rises more than 6% as tariff fears subside and investors flee US tech stocks",
    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "European stocks have outpaced other major global equity markets this month, as fears of sweeping US tariffs subside and investors flee the shakeout in Wall Street technology stocks.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index edged up to a record closing high on Friday, leaving it up 6.3 per cent for January, its best monthly performance since November 2023. The US’s S&P 500 index has risen around 3 per cent, while Japan’s Topix is up 0.1 per cent over the same period.\n\nLondon’s FTSE 100 index also finished at a record high on Friday, taking its returns for the year to 6.1 per cent and marking its best monthly performance since November 2022, when markets rebounded following then prime minister Liz Truss’s ill-fated “mini” Budget two months earlier.\n\nThe gains have sparked renewed hopes of a sustained revival in the region’s equity markets. While some have at times performed strongly — Germany’s Dax rose by nearly one-fifth last year — as a whole Europe has lagged well behind the US over the past decade.\n\n“After so many years of underperformance, not much needs to happen before everyone becomes excited . . . Everyone is getting warm about Europe,” said Roland Kaloyan, a strategist at Société Générale.\n\nInvestors piled into US stocks last year amid excitement about the growth of artificial intelligence, with a small group of tech stocks once again driving gains.\n\nAt the same time, US President Donald Trump’s tariffs threats weighed on Europe, which sends roughly one-fifth of its exports each year to the US, while homegrown political crises in countries such as France diminished investors’ appetite for bonds and equities alike.\n\nBut January saw the biggest rotation from US stocks into Eurozone stocks in almost a decade, according to Bank of America, as investors fled richly valued tech stocks in favour of European defensive and growth stocks, including banks, pharmaceuticals and luxury retailers.\n\nThis week’s global tech sell-off sparked by Chinese start-up DeepSeek’s advances in artificial intelligence has only accelerated this shift, analysts said.\n\nAfter the AI wobbles, “investors have been moving towards . . . Europe”, as the region has less exposure to technology stocks, said Mohit Kumar, an economist at Jefferies.\n\nJust eight per cent of the Stoxx Europe 600 is made up of companies in the IT sector, compared with 30 per cent of the S&P 500, according to calculations by Société Générale. The US index’s tech share rises to 45 per cent if stocks such as Amazon and Alphabet — categorised by the French bank as consumer and communications companies respectively — are included.\n\nIn addition, Trump’s softer stance on tariffs — the White House has said the US will go ahead with 25 per cent duties on goods from Mexico and Canada and 10 per cent on goods from China, although as yet it has failed to hit the euro area with levies — has come as a relief to investors.\n\n“Expectations for Europe were on the floor,” said Sharon Bell, a senior equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. “This has changed.”\n\nAfter years of underperforming Wall Street, European shares are also trading near their widest valuation discount to the US since at least the late 1980s, according to data from SocGen. The UK market in particular has benefited from low valuations, say analysts.\n\n“I have been quite surprised by the increased interest in UK equities, it is probably because the growth expectations are pretty high compared to the rest of Europe,” Bell said.\n\n“And obviously it is cheap. It could also be seen as a hedge against tech . . . for diversification.”\n\nThe strong performance of European stocks comes even as the Eurozone struggles to recover from a sharp rise in energy and food prices triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while the US economy continues to grow strongly. Data this week showed the Eurozone economy unexpectedly stagnated in the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, the prospect of further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank may cheer investors, analysts said. In the US, markets believe inflationary pressures will force the US central bank to keep rates higher for longer.\n\n“If the market starts to freak about inflation in the US that will also be more positive for European equities in comparison,” said SocGen’s Kaloyan.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ray Douglas",

    "body": "Education regulator Ofsted is pressing ahead with plans for a colour-coded scorecard to assess school performance across eight core areas that critics have compared to a Nando’s spice chart.\n\nSir Martyn Oliver, chief inspector of Ofsted, will launch a consultation on a new system for assessing schools in England in which single-word judgments would be replaced with one- or two-word judgments across eight main areas, according to an internal presentation seen by the Financial Times on Thursday.\n\nThe system would replace the old process where schools were given an overall judgment ranging from “outstanding” to “inadequate”, which teachers have long complained was overly simplistic, often unrepresentative and extremely difficult to appeal against.\n\nThe eight core assessment areas that schools will be judged against are achievement, leadership and governance, curriculum, developing teaching, personal development and wellbeing, attendance, behaviour and attitudes, and inclusion.\n\nThe assessment areas of “preparation for next steps” and “opportunities to thrive” have been dropped since a previous iteration of the scorecard was circulated to stakeholders in November.\n\nThe consultation is expected to be launched next week, according to a senior figure in the school sector.\n\nOfsted did not comment.\n\nThe proposals to colour-code the performance designations have faced strong pushback from senior figures in the teaching sector, with some comparing it to the spice-ranking system used by fast-food restaurant Nando’s.\n\n“It’s still Nando’s. It’s still lemon and herbs, extra hot,” said a senior figure in education, adding that the “profession’s going to go wild when they see these plans”.\n\nThe person noted that the new assessment system created even more areas for schools and teachers to receive “harsh” and anxiety-inducing judgments, and they failed to see how inspectors could make meaningful evaluations across so many areas in a 48-hour visit.\n\nThe colours will range from “causing concern” in red to “exemplary” in dark green.\n\nThe Labour government scrapped the previous single-word judgment system last year after lobbying from teaching unions, who said the inspection regime put extraordinary pressure on teachers.\n\nAn independent review last year criticised Ofsted’s handling of the suicide of headteacher Ruth Perry in January 2023, which was linked at the time to a negative Ofsted report that downgraded her school from “outstanding” to “inadequate”. The review said the regulator’s response to the tragedy was “defensive and complacent”.\n\nAn inquest concluded that the negative Ofsted report had contributed to Perry’s death.",

    "event_name": "Bad Education by Matt Goodwin — university challenges",
    "blurb": "An angry polemic rightly recognises that freedom of speech and diversity of opinion is under threat in higher education but fails to analyse the complex problem clearly ",
    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "In Bad Education, Matt Goodwin argues that diversity of opinion is under threat in universities which “are no longer protecting and promoting things like free speech”. Sadly there is clear evidence to support his case — from attempts to monitor “microaggressions” to shocking attempts to suppress the views of gender critical academics such as Kathleen Stock and Jo Phoenix.\n\nGoodwin is angry about hostility he himself has encountered because of his support for the populist right and has made a journey from university academic (until last year he was professor of politics at the University of Kent) to political activist. But his anger gets in the way of analysing the convergence on the university system of a range of very different forces.\n\nFirst is the intellectual climate, itself shaped by universities. They are where critical theory began and flourished. It is a theory which appeals to academics because it says that words matter: language is a tool of oppression. So our language and the curriculum have to be decolonised in order truly to deliver diversity, equity and inclusion. It is an agenda far removed from classic concerns of the left such as what people earn and what access they have to public services. And there is another crucial difference. There were always left-wing academics — as well as some of a more conservative disposition. But the university as an institution was not engaged in their arguments and did not take a view. Now there are universities, especially but not only in America, where advocates of critical theory have recruited university administrators who use university-wide EDI programmes to advance their agenda and try to require academics to comply.\n\nSecondly there is the intense transgender debate, exacerbated in the UK by misinterpretation of the Equality Act. Too many universities, perhaps influenced by the LGBTQ+ rights charity Stonewall, interpreted the Act to mean any form of self-identified gender is a protected characteristic. The Reindorf review of problems at the University of Essex is a clear and authoritative account of serious mistreatment of academics as a result. Since it was published in 2021 no British university should repeat such behaviour.\n\nThe third trend is how students are changing. The psychologists Jean Twenge and Jonathan Haidt have persuasively argued that the rise in access to social media is leading to mental health issues for young people. This can lead to the introduction of trigger warnings and a belief that freedom of speech is less important than protecting people’s feelings. However, higher education appears to provide some resilience to these pressures, lowering the risk of young people withdrawing from work because of mental illness.\n\nThere is a class divide too. Young white working-class men are even less likely to go to university than many ethnic minority groups. We should encourage more to go. The real luxury belief is advantaged graduates saying there is no point going to university when for many young people from disadvantaged backgrounds it is the most powerful tool of social mobility we’ve got. For those who were previously on free school meals, average graduate earnings growth in their first decade is 75 per cent, while for non-graduates it is 26 per cent. But instead of promoting the value of higher education, social mobility advocates have put more weight, probably excessive, on the early years.\n\nThere has also been the shift in attitudes away from globalisation, represented by Trump and Brexit. David Goodhart, cited by Goodwin, makes universities the arch-culprits in his moral divide between citizens of Somewhere or Nowhere. This is particularly hard on universities as most of them have places in their names. They are definitely somewhere and a good thing too. They are very likely to stay rooted in their place even if the big employers move out or the local paper closes down. Towns and cities in the UK such as Chester, Coventry, Worcester or Bournemouth have been revitalised by the emergence of a strong local university. The government may be underestimating the shockwaves if a university closes.\n\nAdd to this mix empowering the student as consumer. The student is not just a consumer, though the university fee is a contract to deliver a service and that strengthens the student voice. Most local student unions don’t want Marxist revolution but to get their academic work back promptly and seminars that are less crowded. But student satisfaction rankings have been given exaggerated weight and empowered students to threaten academics on very different issues.\n\nThere are university leaders who see that all these forces mean they have heavy new responsibilities which they cannot avoid. Universities should be the place where diverse young people learn how to disagree. The 2015 Chicago Statement of the principles of free speech in university is important and Goodwin wants “to force universities, through government action, to sign up” and then to practise what they preach.\n\nHis many anecdotes move between UK and US as if our two university systems are interchangeable. But there are important differences such as greater labour market protections in the UK (and even more in Europe). Protection from unfair dismissal matters if an academic is caught in a social media frenzy. This might explain the paradox that American and to some extent British universities have been far more susceptible to some of these forces than Continental Europe despite their intellectual origins in Continental postmodernist philosophy.\n\nGoodwin wants to use “the powers of the state to restore justice and balance”. The loss of confidence in the ability of universities to protect freedom of speech justified the 2023 freedom of speech legislation with new powers for the university regulator, which I support. But this is tricky territory.\n\nThe problems began on the morning the previous Conservative government launched the initiative. On the Today programme the minister responsible was asked if this meant Holocaust denial would be protected, and she said yes. Holocaust denial is not itself a legal offence in the UK so her statement made sense for a proper free speech absolutist. Within hours, however, No 10 corrected her: it was not protected under the new legislation. We have never known what this free speech code is that does not permit some legal free speech. We do need stronger protections, but Goodwin doesn’t really engage with the issue of whether there are to be any constraints at all.\n\nThere is a great American tradition of academics worrying that the modern university is rejecting the culture which nurtured it — William Buckley’s God and Man at Yale, Allan Bloom’s The Closing of the American Mind, and now Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt’s The Coddling of the American Mind. In Britain we have tended to express our anxieties instead through the campus novel, a genre of which we are masters. Malcolm Bradbury’s The History Man skewers a certain sort of progressive academic with more skill and subtlety than Goodwin manages. Goodwin has some genuine grievances but he mashes different problems up together and then calls it all a row between right and left — if only it were so simple.\n\nBad Education: Why Our Universities Are Broken and How We Can Fix Them by Matt Goodwin Bantam £20, 256 pages\n\nDavid Willetts is a former Conservative Minister for Universities and Science and is author of ‘A University Education’ (OUP)\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café and follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X",

    "blurb": "Mortgage lender Nationwide says affordability ‘remains stretched’",
    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK house price growth slowed more than expected in January as mortgage rates ticked up and affordability remained stretched, mortgage lender Nationwide said.\n\nThe average house price rose to £268,213, up 0.1 per cent from the previous month and 4.1 per cent year on year — less than the annual rise of 4.7 per cent recorded in December.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected a monthly rise of 0.3 per cent and an annual rise of 4.3 per cent.\n\nThe slower than expected house price growth was “not too surprising given the rise in quoted mortgage rates at the end of last year”, said Alex Kerr, economist at the consultancy Capital Economics.\n\nSeparate data from the Bank of England on Thursday showed that mortgage interest rates rose in December, with the average rate for a two-year fixed mortgage with a 60 per cent loan-to-value ratio rising to 4.47 per cent, up from 4.39 per cent in November and 4.21 per cent in October.\n\nThe average rate was well below its 6.22 per cent peak in the summer of 2023, but up from 1.1 per cent in mid-2021, meaning mortgage affordability remained stretched.\n\nThe BoE is expected to announce a quarter percentage point cut in interest rates to 4.5 per cent on Thursday. Markets are pricing three rate cuts throughout this year.\n\nMark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: “With the Bank of England expected to reduce interest rates next week, the outlook for borrowers is looking up.”\n\nExperts say house prices are also being supported by a potential increase in demand ahead of the expiry of a recent stamp duty holiday. From April, first-time buyers, for example, will start paying the levy for properties worth £300,000 or more, instead of £425,000 at present.\n\nNationwide reported improving housing affordability last year in part thanks to wage growth.\n\nHowever, a prospective buyer earning the average UK income and buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20 per cent deposit would still have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 36 per cent of their take-home pay — well above the long-run average of 30 per cent.\n\nFurthermore, house prices remain high relative to average earnings, with the first-time buyer house price-to-earnings ratio standing at 5.0 at the end of 2024, still well above the long-run average of 3.9.\n\nRobert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said the market had shown resilience “despite ongoing affordability pressures”.\n\n“While there has been a modest improvement over the last year, affordability remains stretched by historic standards,” he said.",

    "body": "Driverless cars were once something we used to watch in sci-fi movies. Now, we’re closer to watching sci-fi movies in driverless cars.\n\nThis week, as the UK government took new steps to achieve its 2030 electric vehicle target, Sarah O’Connor discussed the merits of another ambitious automotive goal — self-driving cars whose record on safety could ultimately “save lives”.\n\nBoth Google’s Waymo and Tesla founder Elon Musk — who plans to launch a driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, this year — have claimed that automated road travel is not only imminent, but also safer than the status quo.\n\nRoad safety is a worthy goal, O’Connor writes, but the status quo is surprisingly safe. In 2022, the latest year for which there is data, the fatality rate was a mere 1.33 deaths per 100mn vehicle miles travelled. The data for driverless cars is less forgiving, partially because there is so little of it.\n\nNevertheless, Musk, head of the new Department of Government Efficiency, is gearing up for a step-change. On Wednesday, he announced plans to start production of a fleet of autonomous taxis, known as “cybercabs”, in 2026. But his enthusiasm contrasts sharply with public sentiment.\n\nMany US drivers have expressed reservations about fully driverless technology. The share of US drivers who say they are “afraid” of automated cars has risen from 54 in 2021 to 66 per cent in 2024, while trust has dropped from 14 per cent to 9 per cent in 2024.\n\nThere may be less evidence that driverless cars are dangerous, but there is little evidence that it is any safer than the human alternative.\n\nSo what do you think? Are driverless cars safer than those driven by humans?

    "blurb": "When Arne Maynard and William Collinson acquired some of Britain’s most ancient breed, the novice farmers saw conservation grazing coax their pasture back to life ",
    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "When garden designer Arne Maynard and his partner William Collinson acquired their Monmouthshire home, Allt y bela, from the Spitalfields Trust in 2008, with it came a 4-acre plot that circled the medieval house. It was enough space to create a jewel-box garden studded with clipped yew and beech topiary, exquisite borders, an ornamental kitchen garden and swaths of meadows that were gently and patiently coaxed back from scrubland.\n\nBut the 15th-century house, which sits in a deep basin with pasture and woodland rising up around it, had originally been part of a much larger estate of 160 acres. In 2022 this “lost” land — the largest single Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Wales — became available to buy. “It always felt like we were connected to the landscape,” says Maynard. “But bringing the land back in ownership with the house — all of a sudden, the house had a completely different feel and a different purpose. It was like a divorce that we reunited.”\n\nThe land had been largely unmanaged, which meant an enormous variety of wild flowers had flourished — but so too had pernicious weeds. “Most of the land was covered with brambles and bracken, some of it to chest height,” explains Collinson, who first had to repeatedly flail the land to clear it, a process they had already carried out on the wild-flower meadows. “The pastures regenerated quickly, and the bank of wild flowers in those areas which we’ve uncovered has been fantastic. We have huge quantities of orchids. They’re just everywhere. You can’t step on to the pastures without standing on an orchid.”\n\nPart of the management plan set out by Natural Resources Wales — who oversee the SSSI designation — was that the land should be grazed properly, and that provided Collinson with the opportunity to realise a long-held dream. He’s descended from a long line of farmers — his maternal ancestors had farmed a block of land on the Somerset Levels since the Domesday.\n\nThey acquired a small herd of White Park cattle in 2022. It’s an ancient breed — its distinctive head, with long elegant horns, has been the logo of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust since its inception in 1973, when there were only around 65 breeding females of White Park left; there are around 750 today. It’s widely considered to be the most ancient British breed, descended from the country’s original wild white cattle and prized for its hardy nature. For the novice farmer, this was a key consideration, since the herd can happily live outside year round.\n\nBut the White Park is also valued for its excellent foraging abilities and gentle grazing, making it the perfect breed for coaxing back the land, clearing overgrown patches and opening it up in “a completely natural way”. Once the process of clearing patches begins, the cows then go in and forage to fully clear it, exposing the soil and, at the same time, exposing the seed bank, allowing native wild flowers to grow and kick-starting a regenerative cycle.\n\n“It’s fantastic to see how the land is improving, to see how the land has become different during the period of our ownership. You can see quite clearly how our pasture is different,” says Maynard. The grasses on their land are all native, in contrast with modern hybrid grasses used on many nearby farms. “Pastures owned by farmers who farm more intensively and fertilise look completely different. Ours feels medieval.”\n\nAs well as a sea of orchids, including the common spotted orchid and southern marsh orchid, the land is now rich with wild flowers including cardamine, knapweed, cranesbills, yarrow, vetch, buttercups, sorrel and betony. Abundant birdlife has followed, including nightingales in summer.\n\nThe White Park herd roams between pasture and woodland, allowing it to self-medicate with herbs and wild flowers, and to eat bark from hazel and fruit trees. “In the old days, farmers used to cut green branches to feed the cattle and they would graze off all the lower leaves,” says Maynard. “They might kill off the young bark of hazel, but there’s this whole ecosystem that starts to happen.”\n\nConservation grazing has grown substantially over the past 15 to 20 years says Christopher Price, chief executive of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. In the charity’s latest watchlist rare breeds including Dartmoor sheep, New Forest ponies, saddleback pigs and native goat breeds are among those increasing in number. It’s a welcome return. “The landscapes and habitats that we cherish were largely created by wild or semi-feral grazing animals,” says Price.\n\nMaynard and Collinson currently have 13 cows. Caring for the herd has, says Collinson, been a daily adventure, everything from dealing with the grisly fallout from a broken horn (“shocking in the extreme”) to the awe of the first calves being born last spring. The cows take themselves off to find a hollow or dense copse where they give birth alone, before calling for the rest of the herd, who then form a protective crèche for the new addition.\n\n“Every day I’m learning something new,” he adds. “They are quite docile, quite friendly, but terribly strong. You can rub their noses, and they’ll eat out of your hand. And I know them well, but they’re also wilful. They won’t do what they don’t want to do.”\n\nHe’d like to slowly expand the herd to perhaps 15 or 20 in total. “It wouldn’t be enough to make any kind of a living from, but the sense of wellbeing that comes from managing them is fantastic. Something that money can’t buy.”\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow @ft_houseandhome on Instagram\n\nThis article has been amended",

    "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government’s border security bill will lead to about 100 more people being sent to prison each year, according to internal government estimates, while criminalising asylum seekers who seek to prevent rescue operations at sea.\n\nExperts have questioned whether the measures will lead to a reduction in overall arrivals of migrants by small boats.\n\nIn moves aimed at targeting smuggling gangs the new border security, asylum and immigration bill will give the government counterterrorism-style powers, such as seizing electronic equipment — including mobile phones — belonging to migrants when they cross the Channel into the UK.\n\nIt will create an offence of “endangering life at sea”, aimed at criminalising people who prevent offers of rescue while at sea — in order to ensure their boat reaches English shores.\n\nThe legislation will also make it illegal in this context to supply or handle small boats and related equipment, including engines and life jackets. Those caught will face up to 14 years in prison.\n\nChris Philp, shadow home secretary, said the bill “only engages in minor tinkering . . . that won’t stop the boats”.\n\nWhile most of the former government’s Illegal Migration Act, which blocked anyone arriving via small boats from claiming asylum in the UK, is set to be repealed, several of its provisions are being maintained.\n\nThese include a ban on migrants claiming protection under modern slavery laws, the power to detain children for up to 28 days, and a cap on the number of people who can come to the UK via safe and legal routes.\n\nWhile the legislation is primarily targeted at those in the UK who are involved in facilitating people-smuggling operations, it also gives the government powers to criminalise people who have been involved in activities overseas, including supplying inflatable boats.\n\nOfficials confirmed that the government could use existing powers to extradite foreign criminals to the UK so they can face charges for crimes under the new legislation, which is expected to pass into law by the end of the year.\n\nThey said that the goal of the legislation is to disrupt criminal gangs and ultimately reduce the number of people arriving on small boats to the UK.\n\nAbout 37,000 people came to Britain via small vessels in 2024, a rise of a quarter on the 29,500 who arrived in 2023.\n\nPeople briefed on internal calculations said the Ministry of Justice estimated the new powers and offences would result in about 100 extra people being sent to prison each year,\n\nColin Yeo, an immigration barrister, said that while the legislation could theoretically result in that number of arrests, “it seems highly unlikely that would actually reduce arrivals” of migrants by small boats.\n\n“Prosecuting people smugglers who never set foot on British soil is impossible and more would spring up to meet demand anyway,” he said.\n\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, praised the government for repealing much of the previous government’s legislation — including its scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda — saying it had “averted a meltdown, cutting delays and preventing higher hotel costs”.\n\nHowever, he said he was “very concerned that, by creating new offences, many refugees themselves could also be prosecuted”, which would be “a gross miscarriage of justice”.",

    "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government has been accused of “deprioritising” mental health after a number of NHS targets were scrapped under a planned overhaul.\n\nHospital bosses in England will be judged against far fewer targets under updated annual guidance published on Thursday, which saw the number of goals pared back from 32 to 18.\n\nHealth secretary Wes Streeting outlined a renewed focus on A&E waiting times and reducing appointment backlogs, but critics have warned that fewer targets means other areas will inevitably be cut.\n\nAxed objectives include ensuring 75 per cent of people with severe mental illness receive a full annual physical health check, and a goal to increase the number of adults completing a course of treatment for anxiety and depression.\n\nMore than 2mn people are on NHS waiting lists for mental health treatments or courses, according to campaigners.\n\nMinisters are still protecting mental health spending, and require NHS trusts to raise investment in mental health in line with overall budget increases.\n\nNew guidance published on Thursday also states that health leaders should seek to reduce average length of stay in adult acute mental health beds and improve access to children and young people’s mental health services.\n\nThe updated document contains fewer “national priorities”, which are broader NHS goals, but major objectives on A&E waiting times and reducing waiting lists have remained.\n\nAt the heart of the new guidance is a target to ensure 65 per cent of patients on a waiting list for routine hospital care are seen within 18 weeks.\n\nMinisters have vowed that 92 per cent of patients will begin treatment for an ailment — or get the all-clear within this timeframe — by the end of the parliament in 2029. This NHS target was last met at the end of 2015.\n\nAndy Bell, chief executive at the Centre for Mental Health, said waiting times are “just as important” as those for other care.\n\n“We are deeply disappointed that waiting lists for elective care have been given priority over those for mental healthcare,” he said.\n\nHe added that placing these NHS patients on a “lower footing” was “unjust”.\n\nSarah Hughes, chief executive of Mind, added: “The lack of a credible plan to get the 2mn people on mental health waiting lists the help they need, the dropping of key mental health targets, and lack of adequate funding means this government appears to be deprioritising mental health.”\n\nThe dementia diagnosis rate target, which requires 67 per cent of people living with dementia in England to receive a diagnosis, was also scrapped from the guidance.\n\nFiona Carragher, chief policy and research officer for the Alzheimer’s Society, called the decision “unacceptable” and said it “sends the message that dementia doesn’t matter”.\n\nThe guidance also calls on NHS organisations to simultaneously “reduce their cost base” by at least 1 per cent and achieve 4 per cent improvement in productivity, which health leaders warned would be “unbelievably stretching” for the NHS to achieve.\n\nAn additional target set out on Thursday is for 75 per cent of cancer patients to have their first treatment within 62 days, compared with the current target of 70 per cent.\n\nStreeting said: “If everything is a priority, then nothing is. I want to empower NHS leaders to deliver the innovation and reform required to fix the NHS, rather than overload them with targets which have failed to deliver better outcomes for patients.\n\n“This new approach will see the NHS focus on what matters most to patients — cutting waiting lists, getting seen promptly at A&E, and being able to get a GP appointment.”",

    "blurb": "Government’s models suggest Sustainable Aviation Fuel will take years to make significant impact",
    "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Fossil fuels will account for more than three-quarters of fuel used by airlines beyond 2040 — according to the British government’s own projections — undermining Rachel Reeves’ claims that new technologies will turn aviation green.\n\nThe UK chancellor said on Thursday that “sustainable aviation fuels” are a “game-changer” in the debate over airport expansion, as she forecast that flights could take off from a new runway at Heathrow by 2035.\n\nReeves has angered environmentalists — but delighted some business groups — by encouraging Heathrow’s management to put forward plans for the third runway by this summer, with the hope of achieving planning permission before the next election in 2029.\n\n“We’ve asked Heathrow to come forward with plans for that third runway by the summer, and we’ve said that it needs to meet strict rules about environmental and carbon emissions . . . I do believe they can. And Heathrow believes that they can as well,” Reeves told the BBC.\n\n“I believe [sustainable aviation fuels] are a game-changer in the way that we fly and the carbon emissions,” she said.\n\nBut the government is only expecting 22 per cent of UK jet fuel to be supplied by SAF by 2040, according to a document dated December 2024.\n\nSAF is made from a diverse range of sources, including crops, used cooking oil, household waste or hydrogen and can emit about 70 per cent less carbon dioxide over its life cycle than traditional aviation fuel.\n\nIt is also much more expensive than traditional jet fuel and is currently only available in small quantities.\n\nThe government in January introduced a mandate that required fuel producers to supply a portion of SAF for flights departing the UK.\n\nThe mandate is for 2 per cent of fuel to be SAF this year and steadily rises to reach 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040.\n\nThe targets are in line with the aviation industry’s road map to reach net zero by 2050, which is heavily reliant on SAF but includes other measures such as more efficient conventional jets and air traffic control management.\n\nBut Tim Johnson, the director of the Aviation Environment Federation, said that under current forecasts the aviation industry would need all the available SAF in the UK in 2035 just to meet the growth in flight numbers from a third runway at Heathrow.\n\n“This is not just this government having an over-optimistic take on SAF. It is consistent with every government in the world, because falling back on SAF allows them to continue to pursue growth,” he said.\n\nAirlines are concerned that not enough SAF is being produced to hit the government’s targets and some have suggested that the SAF mandates might need to be watered down.\n\nTo help build a homegrown SAF industry, airlines and airports have urged ministers to speed up the rollout of a financial support mechanism to encourage investors to put money into production.\n\n“There needs to be an alignment between the hugely welcome language around growth and boosting capacity at airports and incentivising the production of SAF,” said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of lobby group Airlines UK.\n\nThe government has outlined plans for an industry-funded “revenue certainty mechanism”, which would guarantee a minimum price for the fuel, similar to schemes used to underwrite nuclear and offshore wind projects.\n\nBut it is not expected to be introduced until the end of next year.\n\nA Government spokesperson said: “We are committed to delivering greener aviation to support our mission to kick-start economic growth and to make Britain a clean energy superpower.\n\n“We are already making great strides in the path to greener aviation, with new targets for sustainable aviation fuel starting this year. Yesterday we also announced £63 million to boost UK production of sustainable fuels and set out measures to attract investment in in the UK sustainable aviation fuels market.”\n\nNoaman Al Adhami, head of UK at fuel company Alfanar, said he cannot close the financing for a plant to produce more than 130,000 tonnes of SAF a year on Teesside without the guarantees from the government on a revenue certainty mechanism.\n\n“Without it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to close the project,” he said.\n\nThe previous Tory government’s plan to scale up SAF production called for five refineries to be under construction in the UK by the end of this year. None have been financed or built.\n\nGlobal SAF production volumes reached 1.3bn litres last year and accounted for 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production, according to Iata.\n\nGiven the challenges to scaling up SAF globally, Al Adhami said the UK was still ahead of many other countries, following its introduction of both the mandate and promise of a revenue support mechanism.\n\n“At least now from a risk perspective and the capital we have invested in the UK, there is more certainty,” he said.",

    "blurb": "Red lines hobble the chancellor’s ambitions ",
    "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Good afternoon on this, the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the week that Rachel Reeves tried to put the rocket-boosters under Labour’s economic growth strategy.\n\nHer upbeat speech in Oxford observed that getting Britain growing again was based on three pillars: political stability, regulatory reform and the combination of private and public investment.\n\nThere wasn’t much to disagree with, but because of the damage done by the Budget, it will take more than a sprightly speech for Reeves to dispel the underlying sense that this is a government still struggling to find the “political stability” that is essential if they are to plausibly present themselves as agents of enduring change.\n\nReeves praised MakeUK, the manufacturers’ organisation, but reacting to the speech, chief executive Stephen Phipson warned that the government needed to resolve the contradiction between its growth-suppressing Budget and the paper ambitions set out by the chancellor.\n\nAnd therein lies the challenge.\n\nThe headline announcements that the government is backing a third runway at Heathrow, is getting behind the Oxford-Cambridge Arc again and will support the Manchester United regeneration project sends a clear signal to international investors that the UK is “open for business”.\n\nLess clear is whether a government led by a prime minister who is now less popular than Rishi Sunak at his nadir, has the political gumption to make the arguments necessary to deliver on ambitions that will pay relatively slow dividends.\n\nThis is not to be churlish, but to observe that Reeves’ speech was delivered by a chancellor already on the back foot. Last summer this would have sounded like Labour firing the starting gun on its rescue mission for Britain, not a government trying to rescue itself.\n\nNew administrations usually start with an announcements phase followed by a period of delivery and then a recrimination phase when, inevitably, they come up short. This government managed to skip straight to the recrimination phase.\n\nGoodwill hunting\n\nThe bungled Budget has starved the government of goodwill with the public and business community that it badly needs. Because the road ahead will be hard — there will be opposition to Heathrow, downside risks from deregulation and furious Nimby protests.\n\nThe revival of the OxCam Arc is a case in point. Hitting the high-growth scenarios outlined by Reeves, will require driving through the final section of the East West Rail line from Bedford to Cambridge while building a lot of houses along those tracks in one of the most congested areas of the country.\n\nThe last attempt by the Tories failed because of local opposition. As Local council leaders in Cambridge told me this week — including the Labour leader of Cambridge City council, Mike Davey — it’s imperative that this government doesn’t repeat the political mistakes of the last one and lose public goodwill.\n\nAs Lucy Nethsingha, the Liberal Democrat leader of Cambridgeshire county council, put it:\n\nTo put in context the scale of the task. Reeves announced that the Environment Agency had finally cleared the long-delayed 5,400 home new town development at Waterbeach in Cambridge.\n\nBut according to research by Public First for the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster Board seen by the Financial Times, the region will need 15,000 homes a year on average to hit a high-growth trajectory — that’s a threefold increase above 2023 levels in Greater Cambridge, Oxford and Milton Keynes.\n\nBrexit blues\n\nThe Budget is not the only place where election manifesto red lines have generated policy contradictions that are now hobbling Reeves in her growth mission.\n\nThe chancellor talked about the need for greater investment and trade, but the UK’s “reset” with Europe — which might have convinced investors that the UK was “back” — is severely limited by the decision to rule out rejoining a customs union or the EU single market.\n\nFive years after the TCA came into force, what is notable is how little anything has changed, despite the change of government.\n\nLabour pledged to “tear down the barriers to trade” with the EU while sticking to the same Tory red lines that created the Tories’ “failed” Brexit deal — Reeves’ words, not mine — in the first place.\n\nThere was some positivity this week when (finally) the UK indicated it would look to relink the UK and EU carbon-pricing schemes and may consider joining the Pan-Euro Mediterranean customs agreement, but like Reeves’ growth plans, for now these are paper commitments.\n\nEU officials now tell my colleagues in Brussels they expect a UK-EU summit “in the first half” of the year. That could be April or June, given the purdah period around local elections in May. The EU then needs to collectively agree a mandate. Don’t expect talks until September or even October.\n\nAnd as the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank observed in its comprehensive survey of the past five years, Labour’s plans for the EU reset, including a veterinary agreement and a deal for creative artists will deliver only marginal reductions in friction.\n\n“Whilst benefiting certain sectors, these proposals would do little to address the overall economic impact of Brexit,” it found.\n\nThe reality, as we reported this week, is that the EU “reset” discussion is going nowhere fast, with even the legally non-binding Security Partnership now hung up on the familiar issues of fish and youth mobility, including restoring the rights of EU students to pay “home” fees when they come and study at UK universities.\n\nYou can blame the EU, and the French in particular, for being stuck playing old tunes about “no cherry picking” despite the strategic fears over Ukraine, but in truth the UK has done nothing to really shift the dial or build momentum. It has put no prizes on the table that would make EU member states behave any differently.\n\nAs with the October Budget and business, the government has managed to put itself into the “recrimination phase” with Brussels before it has even announced what it wants. That is a remarkable own-goal.\n\nIn a braver world, Starmer would have done a fast deal on fish (the last government already failed the fishermen) and embraced youth mobility as a cultural and economic opportunity, driving the negotiation with Brussels into a genuinely different place.\n\nIndeed, even very recently, as the Treasury and No 10 went into panic mode over growth, there was a moment to make arguments that going deeper with the EU should be part of the fix, as much as a third runway at Heathrow.\n\nBut that didn’t happen, trapped as the government is by its framing of the problem and the potential opportunity. As one despairing Whitehall insider put it: “It is eerily reminiscent of 2017. We are now in serious danger of sinking back into a low-ambition doomloop.”\n\nAre you enjoying The State of Britain newsletter?

Do tell us what you think; we love hearing from you: stateofbritain@ft.com\n\nReeves described investment as “the lifeblood of economic growth”, but as she also acknowledged, the UK has a long-standing problem with both public and private investment, sitting at the bottom of the G7 pack for much of the past 25 years.\n\nBrexit deepened those investment struggles, according to Stephen Hunsaker, the trade specialist at UKICE (see pp90-94), with public investment taking a particular hit after 2016 as a result of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Investment Bank (EIB).\n\nThe UK has done its best to create domestic alternatives, such as the National Wealth Fund, but Hunsaker calculates these are still “years, if not a decade” from reaching the levels of investment the UK was accustomed to receiving while a part of the EIB.\n\nAs things stand, UK investment banks’ financing levels are still 58 per cent less than what the country received from the EIB in 2016, he calculates.\n\nThe numbers look even gloomier if you consider “what might have been” by comparing actual UK post-2016 investment with the level of EIB investment received by France — a country with a comparable record to the UK’s when it was an EU member.\n\nThe gap, according to Hunsaker, means that in real terms the UK has suffered a potential “loss” of more than £44bn since 2017, compared with the UK remaining in the EU and continuing to receive similar levels of financing to France.\n\nThat’s a lot of bat tunnels, as they no longer say in the Treasury.\n\nI am now away for two weeks, travelling for both business and pleasure.

    "body": "Wine and ice-cream – two things that spark joy, though rarely simultaneously. But at The Dreamery, an otherworldly new wine bar and ice-cream parlour in leafy De Beauvoir Town, north London, they come together magically.\n\nThe pint-sized bar is the work of Alex Young and George de Vos, also the creators of Goodbye Horses, a convivial natural wine bar and restaurant on the same street that proved one of the underground hits of 2024. Around the same time, the pair also launched Day Trip, an artisan coffee shop in the same building. “Both George and I see creating hospitality venues as creating worlds in themselves,” says Young, who used to work in tech. “We wanted to create a little village, an ecosystem that has a feeling of escapism.”\n\nIce-cream and wine can be a tricky match from a purely technical point of view, as the sweetness of the former can make the latter taste flat. But whatever nuance is lost in the pairing is far outweighed by the spirit of fun it creates. “Our approach to pairing is rather anarchic,” admits Young.\n\nThere’s an improvisational feel to the whole enterprise – yet there are some significant names behind the scenes. Goodbye Horses was designed by the Swiss architect Leopold Banchini, who also has a permanent installation at the Centre Pompidou. The courtyard garden at Day Trip was created by garden designer Jihae Hwang, who has won several gold medals at the Chelsea Flower Show. Head of wine at Goodbye Horses is Nathalie Nelles, formerly of Noble Fine Liquor. De Vos himself was formerly GM of Brilliant Corners, a music venue and Japanese restaurant in Dalston.\n\nThe Dreamery is housed in an ex-grocer’s shop. There is no sign outside – just a steamed-up three-paned window filled with animated silhouettes against a wash of colourful lights. The front door looks just like any other on the Victorian terraced street; but then you notice the stoop, which is painted, slightly spookily, with rune-like suns, moons and birds. Inside, it has the bones of an espresso bar – there are stainless-steel counters and mirrored walls. But the eye is drawn to the ceiling, where a dazzling backlit mural by artist Lucy Stein fills the space with colour. In the corner, a 1980s-style boombox plays whimsical Studio Ghibli scores.\n\nGoodbye Horses chef Jack Coggins makes all the ice-creams, which are chalked up in marker pen on the wall: on my visit they included fig leaf, prune & oolong tea, gingerbread and pear and verjus sorbet (£4 per scoop). There’s no printed drinks list, which will irritate some, but there’s a small, regularly changing selection of easy-drinking, “glou-glou” wines: sparkling rosé moscato; crunchy, red-berry beaujolais served cool; Alsatian riesling and one or two dessert wines (from £7.50 a glass). The emphasis is on natural and low-intervention producers.\n\nI squeeze in at the bar and order a post-prandial scoop of coffee and butterscotch, and a glass of tawny passito moscato by Cascina Cerutti, which is caramelised and nutty; my friend has the fig-leaf ice-cream and a glass of lychee-scented riesling. Both wines have a degree of natural sweetness and so the end result is actually lovely.\n\nThe ice-cream comes in a stemmed steel gelato cup, like you might see in a cartoon. The wine glasses are printed with a crescent moon eating an ice-cream cone by Stein. Her folkloric illustrations are also a centrepiece of the more naturalistic Goodbye Horses across the street; they run the full length of the 10m bar and weave their way down the gauzy curtains. “There’s a sort of childlike quality to Lucy’s work,” says Young, “like you’re seeing things with fresh eyes.”\n\nOne influence for The Dreamery was the Paris bar Folderol, a fashionable glacerie-bar-à-vin in the 11th arrondissement. Young also tips his hat to GlouGlou in Amsterdam, “which has a big by-the-glass selection and is fun and easy-going in a way that wine bars often aren’t”. “The real guiding principle for all our bars is that we just want people to have a really nice time,” he says. “And I don’t think there’s anything more fun and joyous than eating ice-cream and drinking wine.”\n\n@alicelascelles",

    "body": "Rogue operators that offer poor-quality courses on behalf of English universities in order to exploit the student loan system face a crackdown, under plans outlined by ministers on Thursday.\n\nThe Department for Education is proposing reforms to tighten controls on university franchising arrangements, after an investigation by the National Audit Office found fraudulent providers cost taxpayers £2mn in 2022-23.\n\nUnder the plans, course operators with more than 300 students will need to register with the Office for Students “to ensure their courses meet rigorous quality standards” in order to receive funding, or face fines or possible suspension.\n\nMore than half of 341 franchised institutions are currently unregistered, the department said on Thursday.\n\nThe growing number of franchised providers in higher education has been partly driven by the financial crisis facing universities, which are looking to increase student numbers in a bid to offset high costs and a long-running freeze in domestic tuition fees.\n\nThe number of students enrolling on franchised courses more than doubled from 50,400 in 2018-19 to over 130,000 this academic year, according to departmental figures.\n\nThe NAO report found that 53 per cent of the £4.1mn fraud detected by the Student Loans Company involved courses from franchised providers, despite accounting for only 6.5 per cent of total loan-funded students during the 2022-23 academic year.\n\nThe investigation uncovered a range of fraudulent activity, including loans being paid to students who had not met course admission criteria and were unable to provide an acceptance letter to the Student Loans Company, the government body that oversees course financing.\n\nIt also found that some providers were not checking whether students were attending their courses despite this being a condition of loan funding.\n\nSome franchised providers also used agents or paid cash bonuses to persuade students to sign up to courses, it found.\n\nEducation secretary Bridget Phillipson said: “We are committed to cracking down on rogue operators who misuse public money and damage the reputation of our world-class universities.\n\n“The credibility of our universities is at stake, but these proposals seek to protect students and safeguard taxpayers’ money.”\n\nThe DfE’s move to protect standards in the higher education sector comes during a period of financial uncertainty for universities.\n\nSeveral universities have reopened voluntary severance schemes, which could potentially lead to the loss of nearly 1,000 jobs, as they struggle to recruit lucrative international students, whose fees account for a growing share of the sector’s income.\n\nData published on Thursday by the university admissions service Ucas revealed that a number of Russell Group universities were among the dozens of institutions hit by a double-digit decline in new international undergraduates during the 2024 application cycle.\n\nThe hardest hit Russell Group members were Newcastle University and the University of Sheffield, where admissions declined 26 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.\n\nNewcastle University announced its voluntary severance scheme last week in an attempt to save £20mn, 5 per cent of its pay budget — or the equivalent of 300 full-time positions, according to a memo seen by the Financial Times.\n\nNewcastle University said it was “not immune” to the funding challenges facing the higher education sector.\n\nUniversities outside of the Russell Group have also been affected. The University of East Anglia is looking to reduce its headcount by 163 full-time equivalent staff in order to save £11mn, despite experiencing a 73 per cent increase in international undergraduate admissions for the current academic year.\n\nJo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said her organisation was willing to ballot for strike action in response to job cuts. “Our members refuse to stand by and allow university managers to commit academic vandalism on such a grand scale . . . Unfortunately, serious industrial unrest cannot be ruled out.”\n\nCardiff University on Tuesday announced plans to cut 400 jobs, as well as the merging of departments and cuts to multiple courses including nursing.\n\nThe Department for Education said: “We’ve been up front about the tough financial situation we’ve inherited in relation to [higher education] providers in England, and we are determined to put our universities on a secure footing after years of financial challenges.”\n\nThe government announced last year that tuition fees would start to rise in line with inflation from 2025-26.",

    "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK’s postal regulator has proposed easing the Royal Mail’s obligations, allowing the company to make fewer deliveries as the group prepares for new ownership under Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský.\n\nThe planned changes would allow Royal Mail to make second-class deliveries on alternate weekdays rather than six days a week at present, and reduce its requirement to deliver first-class mail on the following day from 93 per cent to 90 per cent.\n\nOfcom admitted that the “world has changed”, with people in the UK “sending a third of the letters we were 20 years ago”.\n\n“We need to reform the postal service to protect its future and ensure it delivers for the whole of the UK,” said Ofcom’s networks director Natalie Black.\n\nThe regulator’s proposals, which will be put out for public consultation until April, come after intense lobbying from Royal Mail’s owner International Distribution Services.\n\nThe lossmaking group had been seeking regulatory approval for the changes, which also include ending second-class letter delivery on Saturday.\n\nRoyal Mail’s chief executive Emma Gilthorpe welcomed the proposals, saying Ofcom’s analysis showed that “it is no longer financially sustainable to maintain a network built for 20bn letters when we are now only delivering 6.7bn”.\n\nOfcom’s plans come about a month after the government approved the sale of Royal Mail to Křetínský in a £5.3bn deal that will pave the way for the once state-owned postal monopoly to pass into foreign ownership.Křetínský had cautioned that Royal Mail was facing a “deadly downward spiral” as it sought to defend its position while navigating rising competition in the parcels market.The company must adhere to the “universal service obligation”, under which Royal Mail is the only delivery group required to deliver letters anywhere in the country, at the same cost every day besides Sunday. As part of Křetínský’s deal, he committed to respecting the universal service obligation for as long as he controls Royal Mail.\n\nRoyal Mail had been fined £10.5mn in December for failing to meet its delivery targets. The regulator also called on Royal Mail to “invest in its network” and bolster efficiency and service across both parcel and letter delivery.\n\nThe Post Office, which is separate to Royal Mail, said that its postmasters and customers “do not want to see a reduction in the universal service obligation”.\n\nIt added: “The UK is the only country in the world where the delivery arm is separate from the physical retail shop and the proposals announced today put more pressure on postmasters who are already facing tough trading conditions.”",

    "body": "Rachel Reeves said flights could be taking off from a new Heathrow third runway “within a decade”, as she also in effect banned new “bat tunnels” in big UK infrastructure projects to help growth.\n\nThe chancellor defended her support for a third runway at Heathrow — a project opposed by London Labour mayor Sir Sadiq Khan — saying she had to make decisions “in the national interest”.\n\nAsked by the BBC’s Today programme when she hoped the project might get planning permission with spades in the ground, Reeves replied: “By the end of the parliament.” The next election is expected in 2029.\n\nShe claimed flights on the new runway could be leaving by 2035. “We think we can get flights off within a decade,” she said, adding that Heathrow had to compete with other hub airports in Amsterdam and Frankfurt.\n\nHeathrow chief Thomas Woldbye told the Financial Times the government’s timeline was “ambitious, but not undoable”.\n\nAlthough a third runway is opposed by Khan and some Labour MPs — particularly those representing seats in the capital — it has the support of the Conservatives.\n\n“On Heathrow we are in principle in favour of this move,” said Mel Stride, shadow chancellor, adding that he would back Labour’s efforts to get infrastructure projects built.\n\n“Labour don’t appear to be entirely united on this,” he said. “But I think the main point is we should absolutely be talking about long-term investment in this country.”\n\nIn the same interview, Stride declined to say whether the Tories would reverse last year’s £25bn increase in national insurance for business, saying he would set out the party’s fiscal plans closer to the election.\n\nDaisy Cooper, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said expanding Heathrow was “the wrong thing to do” and that “the damage to the climate will be huge”.\n\nOn Thursday, the chancellor also bemoaned the HS2 bat tunnel, claiming that costly schemes to protect wildlife were one of the reasons Britain was failing to deliver affordable new transport and housing schemes, and said that the situation had to end.\n\n“The balance has gone too far in the direction of always protecting every bat and every newt,” she said on Thursday, arguing that Britain had higher costs for new building projects than virtually every other country.\n\nReeves said one of the reasons costs on the HS2 rail project ran out of control was because of “things like £100mn on a bat tunnel”.\n\nThe tunnel, which was intended to protect a rare species of bat, has become a symbol of the myriad costly regulations that hold up national infrastructure work.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether she would block a proposed bat tunnel on a railway line for the government’s new “Oxford-Cambridge arc” project, she said: “Other ways will be found.”\n\nThe chancellor said a new “nature restoration fund” would allow developers to put money into schemes to protect wildlife diversity “but not necessarily where the project is happening”.\n\nReeves claimed this new approach would maintain Britain’s wildlife in a more cost-effective way. Liz Truss, former Conservative prime minister, also wanted to reduce wildlife protections to promote growth.\n\nHS2 said last year the railway had been forced to build the structure to protect a species of bat because of legal requirements in the planning process to protect an endangered species.",

    "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Social media platforms operating in the UK should be forced or incentivised to promote content from trusted sources to avoid an “American news swamp”, according to the boss of broadcaster Channel 4.\n\nAlex Mahon said content from respected broadcasters was being “shadow banned” by computer technology that selected what was promoted online, and regulated providers should be given “algorithmic prominence” to prevent this from happening.\n\n“We’ve got to make sure that we fight for what I’m calling ‘algorithmic prominence’, and prioritisation and identification on those platforms,” she told the Financial Times ahead of a speech on Thursday to the Royal Television Society.\n\n“The way the algorithms works is salacious and attention grabbing. Things travel quicker, which tend to be more rightwing,” said Mahon, who said the likes of Meta and X should be made to change their behaviour, potentially via tax breaks or regulation.\n\nShe added: “Here, in the UK, we still have the option to resist a slide into an American news swamp.”\n\nMahon said US consumers received most of their information from social media platforms that were economically incentivised to spread the popular above the factual because it made more money.\n\n“We definitely see evidence that trusted sources are being shadow banned because you see stories kind of disappear,” she said. “Are we on platforms where we will get prioritised? How do we make sure they can’t just change the algorithm tomorrow?”\n\nMahon’s views will put her at odds with the large US technology groups that control the majority of social media, with the Channel 4 boss saying the proliferation of online disinformation was exacerbating a crisis in society, affecting younger audiences in particular.\n\n“We’re losing social cohesion. We’re splitting into atomised groups who won’t discuss different perspectives, who listen separately to different streams of knowledge,” she said.\n\nMahon also criticised the move by Facebook owner Meta to drop fact checking on its platform in the US, calling it as “antithetical to a cohesive society”.\n\nIn the UK, the Media Act passed last year requires TV platforms to carry and give appropriate prominence to designated public service broadcaster TV apps and content.\n\nMahon can see a similar approach for algorithmic prominence, saying: “You can regulate it. Or you could say ‘to operate here, we give you a tax break’.”\n\nMahon is pushing for a new quality “trustmark” to indicate fact-checked content from professionally produced and regulated media, and urged better means of monetisation for news providers on social media platforms.\n\nShe worries how social media giants such as TikTok, Meta and YouTube avoided responsibility for the content on their sites because they are not classified as publishing businesses — unlike broadcasters.\n\n“We put rules on television when it took up a vast amount of people’s time” to comply with them, she said. “All these platforms are pretending not to be publishers.”\n\nTraditional broadcasters such as Channel 4 are fighting for their future on digital platforms, where their audiences have migrated to but where making money can be harder. The Financial Times this week revealed plans by Sky News to shift resources away from its linear channel to premium paid content.\n\nMahon said Channel 4 was “way ahead” of rivals in its transition to digital, while the group would also diversify its revenue over the next five years by creating its own TV shows for the first time.\n\nThe UK changed the law last year to allow Channel 4 to make and own rights to its own productions for the first time in its 40-year history, rather than outsource production to the independent sector.\n\nThis could include taking equity stakes in TV production groups, Mahon said, but Channel 4 would not spend “billions buying companies”.\n\nChannel 4 had 1.83bn views on social media platforms last year, the majority on TikTok. It has weekly “reach” of about 35mn on social media, about eight times greater than on live television.",

    "blurb": "Oxford-Cambridge arc may help Labour outmanoeuvre Tories but new runway will provoke ire from its own voters",
    "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Good morning. Rachel Reeves delivered her big speech on growth. It contained a number of measures: some good (the Oxford/Cambridge arc tops that list), some bad (the third runway at Heathrow) and some added to give the list of growth initiatives the appearance of a more even regional distribution (the regeneration of Old Trafford).\n\nSome thoughts on the political implications and challenges of them below.\n\nRachel Reeves announced (or in some cases re-announced) a swath of measures as part of her drive to fix the most alarming chart in British politics.\n\nThis is the biggest subplot to essentially everything else in British politics. Our economic model took a huge hit in the global financial crisis, it hasn’t recovered since, and everything that successive governments have tried to fix the problem hasn’t worked. (And some of the things they have done, Brexit most of all, have actively made the problem worse.)\n\nOur lack of growth makes everything harder, politically speaking. (To make matters worse, despite being an ageing island nation with sluggish economic growth, we completely failed to learn or even show much interest in Japan, a country that managed those challenges rather better than we did.) Because of that, we have seen both main parties electing leaders from their outer flanks — Jeremy Corbyn in 2017 and Liz Truss in 2022. It is also why no UK prime minister since David Cameron has been re-elected to a second term and why no prime minister since Tony Blair has served two full terms.\n\nThe best and most exciting measure that Rachel Reeves outlined was the government’s revived backing for the Oxford-Cambridge arc, a strategic plan to build transport links and housing between the two science-rich hubs.\n\nThis was not strictly speaking “new” as Peter Kyle had announced it at the start of the week. The arc has a lot of cross-party support, but it was shelved by Boris Johnson. While his electoral coalition had relatively few voters who would benefit most from the arc, it had an awful lot of people who would have objected to the required extra building.\n\nLabour’s backing for the arc, and the accompanying approval for much-needed infrastructure improvements such as reservoirs, is another signal that the government essentially regards the very rural seats it won for the first time in 2024 as “one-and-done” victories. That approach has some real negative consequences (the cocktail of changes to inheritance tax and other reliefs for agriculture will, I think, have some unwanted consequences and Labour will end up U-turning on them sooner or later). But it also has some great upsides, of which backing the Oxford-Cambridge arc is right at the top.\n\nYou can see the dividing line that Reeves wants here, politically: the Conservatives will be pushed into opposing the development and disruption that investing in the arc involves because of their imperative to compete with the Liberal Democrats in those seats where voters might be resistant to building. And then Labour, Reeves hopes, will be able to say “well, what you would do differently?”\n\nThe chancellor has also urged Heathrow to fast-track proposals to build a third runway: I am frankly unconvinced by this as, indeed, are much of the cabinet. (Do read this excellent piece on the legal and political hurdles that still remain to its construction here.) In the short term, it feels like a good way for the government to lose friends and alienate people among environmentally-inclined voters. It also sets up a fun game that interviewers will be able to play whenever speaking to anyone in the cabinet or front bench who voted against expansion in 2018, asking what, exactly, in their view has changed. (I really don’t think some overly optimistic wishful thinking about “sustainable aviation fuels” is going to cut it on this one.)\n\nMore importantly, given that the government is only going to be able to get away with antagonising its base on so many issues, in terms of its impact on growth and investment, watering down the government’s plans on employment rights gets you far more in terms of business investment and happiness than the third runway.\n\nI saw The Brutalist last night. Personally, I would say: don’t bother. Danny Leigh’s review is exactly right, down to the most damning observation of all, that the film loses its brilliance with the arrival of “a large, dark plot point that, in common with the whole movie, I’ve liked less the more I’ve thought about it”. Marvellous soundtrack, though.",

    "body": "In the shadow of a decommissioned nuclear power plant, a former coal-handling port in North Ayrshire is set to become the site for a £2bn factory that will produce thousands of kilometres of subsea cable used for transmitting renewable energy.\n\nThe regeneration project in one of Scotland’s most deprived areas is a test case for the nation’s ability to foster supply chain manufacturing capacity in a sector that has attracted interest from overseas investors and is crucial to the UK’s ambitions to decarbonise power by 2030.\n\nThe UK and Scottish governments are seeking to harness the economic benefits of the transition to net zero to replace the well-paid jobs being lost in oil and gas, decades on from the pit closures.\n\n“It’s widely felt that Scotland and the UK failed to build out local supply chain for fixed-bottom wind, instead relying on imports of equipment used in the sector,” said Laura Fidao, investment director at the Scottish National Investment Bank, which is partially funding the factory.\n\n“We have a mandate to help build out the domestic supply chain to turn that around for floating offshore wind projects,” she added.\n\nHowever, some industry executives have raised concerns over investing in untested technology.\n\nThe cables play a vital role in decarbonisation, as they are used to transmit power from offshore wind farms, reinforce grid infrastructure and build interconnectors to transfer ft between different countries.\n\nManufacturing start-up XLCC plans to start commercial-scale production from 2030 of high-voltage direct current cables — for which demand outstrips supply by two and a half times — removing one of the biggest bottlenecks in the way of the transition to net zero.\n\nJapan’s Sumitomo last year started construction on the UK’s first high-voltage direct current factory in the Highland port of Nigg that is aiming for production by the second half of 2026, with an estimated £350mn of inward investment backed by £24.5mn of public money.\n\nXLCC’s UK ownership made it stand out, said Fidao at the Scottish National Investment Bank. However, some industry executives have raised questions over the start-up nature of XLCC, which has never built HVDC cable before.\n\nOne developer also said a key risk would be a slower-than-expected rollout of offshore wind farms in the UK, reducing potential orders.\n\nCraig Stevens, investment director at SNIB, said the bank had taken comfort from XLCC working with strategic technical partners such as China’s Orient Cable to produce and test the cable. XLCC said it had hired experts in HVDC manufacturing and was using tried-and-tested technology.\n\nOne potential XLCC customer is a subsea electricity interconnector from Morocco to the UK envisioned by Xlinks, a company founded by Simon Morrish, who is also behind XLCC. But the project is awaiting UK government approval.\n\nXLCC this month received a £20mn investment from SNIB, building on the UK’s National Wealth Fund’s earlier initial investment of £20mn, with the option for an extra £67mn as development progresses.\n\nSNIB, which was founded in 2020 as a development bank, had been established to take on more risk and fund start-ups and growth companies in sectors needed to revitalise the Scottish economy, Fidao said.\n\nThe XLCC facility would support about 900 long-term jobs, including more than 200 apprenticeships, with a further 300 project management roles expected to be based in Scotland.\n\nExpanding Scottish ports, Fidao added, was a priority given the significant quaysides expansion needed to assemble the infrastructure for the rollout of more offshore wind farms.\n\nOne of SNIB’s largest investments to date is a co-investment with the UK into US-owned Ardersier port on the Moray Firth, an inlet of the North Sea.\n\nScotland has a pipeline of 40 gigawatts of offshore wind projects, all of which will require subsea cables to transfer the power ashore.\n\n“Projects are getting delayed, prices are very high,” said Ian Douglas, XLCC’s chief executive. “Companies are fighting very hard to secure supply — you are typically seeing seven-year waits for HVDC cable.”\n\nEuropean cable manufacturers, such as Milan-listed Prysmian, Paris-listed Nexans and Copenhagen-listed NKT, already had full order books, he added.\n\nPrysmian said: “Whilst we have large backlog visibility, to suggest that our order book is full is incorrect.” The company added that it was “working closely with its customers to deliver on time current, and future projects, and is receiving, and bidding for future orders”.\n\nThe first phase of the XLCC facility’s construction envisions 1,300km a year capacity with the potential to rise to 2,600km a year. Global demand in 2030 was forecast at 10,000km a year, XLCC said.\n\nThe Scottish National party government also hopes to incentivise uptake for supply chain companies, such as XLCC, by encouraging renewables developers that source equipment from domestic sources.\n\nSeabed lease agreements for projects from the late 2020s include requirements for local supply chain involvement.\n\n“That will propel manufacturing — it is going to be extremely important to demonstrate local supply chain,” said Gillian Martin, acting secretary for net zero and energy. “Companies will even now be looking at this place for their cables.”",

    "body": "Falling exports and the winding down of production of older car models saw UK vehicle manufacturing fall by almost 12 per cent last year, in the worst annual drop since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCar and van production at British plants fell back below 1mn vehicles, to 905,233 models, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders released on Thursday showed.\n\nThe decline came on the back of weaker exports to Europe as carmakers wrestled with slowing sales of electric vehicles in key markets such as Germany and France.\n\nNissan and Jaguar Land Rover — the UK’s two largest carmakers — also halted production of several models such as the Leaf EV and the Jaguar XE as they prepared to launch a new range of EVs.\n\n“Amid significant geopolitical and trade tensions, UK manufacturers are set on turning billions of pounds of investment into production reality,” Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT said. “Growing pains are inevitable.”\n\nThe production of EVs and plug-in hybrids last year fell by 20.4 per cent, but still accounted for just over a third of all vehicles produced. The SMMT said this dip was temporary, pointing to £23.4bn of new investments announced over the past two years to retool the plants for the electric shift.\n\nSome industry executives have described the UK market as “a safe haven”, with the EU and the US imposing higher tariffs against imports of Chinese electric vehicles.\n\nExports to the EU fell 24.3 per cent and China exports dropped 21.8 per cent while those to the US rose 38.5 per cent.\n\nBut the UK has faced its own challenges as carmakers have struggled to meet the country’s tough EV sales targets.\n\nStellantis last year said the costs of complying with the government’s “zero emission vehicle mandate” was partly behind its decision to close its Luton van factory, putting 1,100 jobs at risk.\n\nFord also blamed the mandate as it cut 800 UK roles last year in a wider European restructuring, while Nissan warned jobs at its Sunderland plant, the largest in Britain, could be at risk unless the government relaxed its rules.\n\nThe scheme requires a certain percentage of each carmakers’ annual sales to be zero emission vehicles, with the percentage annually rising from 28 per cent this year to 80 per cent in 2030. Companies face fines of £15,000 for each missed vehicle.\n\nUK car production peaked at more than 1.6mn before the Brexit vote in 2016 and British plants are now capable of producing 1.1mn vehicles annually after the closure of Honda’s Swindon plant and JLR said it would cease producing vehicles in Castle Bromwich, Solihull.",

This is more than three times what it was in 2020, when there were just 455 incidents a day.\n\nMeanwhile, losses from customer theft reached £2.2bn, up from £1.8bn the previous year, adding further pressure to the mounting costs retailers already face.\n\n“Every day this continues, criminals are getting bolder and more aggressive,” Dickinson added.\n\nMany of the incidents were linked to organised crime, with gangs systematically targeting stores across the country, often stealing tens of thousands of pounds’ worth of goods and moving around multiple stores, the BRC said.\n\nJohn Lewis and Waitrose last year said “greed not need” was driving record levels of shoplifting as the retail group upped its security to combat it.\n\nThe group has been installing technology in larger supermarkets to automatically stop trolleys if items have not been paid for and installing more public display monitors that act like mirrors near the alcohol and meat aisles — sections attractive to thieves.\n\nThe amount spent on crime prevention was also at a record high, with retailers investing £1.8bn on measures such as CCTV, more security staff, anti-theft devices and body-worn cameras, up from £1.2bn the previous year.\n\nPaddy Lillis, general secretary of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, said: “Crime has a very direct impact on the viability of stores, as retailers go to increasing lengths and expense to make them secure and safe.”\n\nThe Labour government has pledged to address the rise in retail crime through stronger measures to tackle shoplifting and antisocial behaviour, including removing the £200 threshold for so-called low-level theft. It said it would introduce a standalone offence for assaulting a retail worker in England and Wales.\n\nIn 2023, police and the previous government launched measures to tackle the rise in retail crime, known as the Retail Crime Action Plan.",

    "body": "Household water bills in England and Wales are expected to rise by an average of 26 per cent to £603 this year, marking the biggest annual increase since privatisation 36 years ago.\n\nSouthern Water’s customers face the biggest rise of the 11 water and sewerage companies, with bills expected to surge by 47 per cent — or £224 — to £703 from April, according to figures released by lobby group Water UK on Thursday. Thames Water, the largest and most financially troubled company, has handed its customers a 31 per cent increase that will see bills rise on average by £151 to £639 this year.\n\nWater UK said the extra cash was needed to deliver an annual record of £20bn of investment by utilities by March next year, the first wave in a £104bn programme up to 2030. This would include the upgrading of 1,700 wastewater treatment works as well as supporting the building of nine new reservoirs.\n\nThe reservoirs, some of which will require additional surcharges to bills, were endorsed on Wednesday by chancellor Rachel Reeves as part of her economic growth agenda.\n\nThe sector regulator, Ofwat, said in December that water companies could increase bills by an average of 36 per cent by 2030. It said at the time that it would allow the utilities to apply the majority of these increases in the first year of the five-year period.\n\nThursday’s average bill figures are different to those announced in December as they include CPHI inflation and are adjusted for population forecasts.\n\nDavid Henderson, chief executive of Water UK, acknowledged the pressure on households, pledging to double the amount of support for cash-strapped customers.\n\n“We understand increasing bills is never welcome and, while we urgently need investment in our water and sewage infrastructure, we know that for many this increase will be difficult,” he said.\n\nSupport varies between companies as social tariff schemes, which are designed to lower bills for struggling households, involve companies surveying wealthier customers to ask whether they agree to subsidise bills for the less well-off.\n\nOfwat said last week that almost half of households in England and Wales had struggled to pay for their water over the past 12 months. More than 8 per cent of households — or 2.5mn people — were in payment arrears, with the average amount owed at about £822, Ofwat said.\n\nThe Consumer Council for Water, which represents customers, said many households would be “unable to cope” with bill increases, which it said represented the “largest rise in water bills since privatisation of the water industry”. Its own research showed that many households had already cut spending on essentials such as food and heating to afford bills.\n\nThe increases come in the wake of warnings from Ofwat over the financial stability of 10 companies, which receive nearly all their revenues from customer bills.\n\nThames Water and Southern Water, which are under particular scrutiny, are understood to be weighing an appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority after receiving lower bill increases from Ofwat in December than they had hoped.\n\nThe chief executives of both utilities took large bonuses last year despite suffering credit downgrades. Thames Water has also warned that it will run out of cash by March unless it receives approval for an emergency £3bn loan in the High Court next month.\n\nThe three listed water companies — Pennon, Severn Trent and United Utilities — have all ruled out appeals to the CMA, as has non-profit Dŵr Cymru.\n\nDavid Black, chief executive of Ofwat, said that the infrastructure investment programme was “ambitious”. He added: “Where companies underperform, or investment isn’t delivered, we will hold companies to account and protect customers.”",

    "blurb": "This time around, the Trump victory comes as the UK is vulnerable to potent arguments from the right",
    "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The complacent offer a theatrical yawn. We’ve seen this movie before. The combination in 2016 of Brexit and Donald Trump’s first victory saw the American populist right sensing fertile territory in the UK. It petered out. Association with Trump was not electorally helpful. Now the film has a sequel in which Britain is viewed less as a potential soulmate than a weakened enemy to be attacked by the newly buoyant international right.\n\nThere is nothing new in political internationals. From the formal Comintern to the more sinuous networks for globalisation and neoliberalism, there have always been groupings seeking to export their world view. Trump’s first-term strategist Steve Bannon dreamt of a global movement. National Conservatism, an evangelical ethno-nationalist faction with strong ties to Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, has worked to extend its influence in the UK.\n\nNor is Britain unused to external attacks — although in recent years it was Brexit which provoked the incoming ordnance from both Europe and the White House.\n\nWeakened EU nations, notably Germany are also facing fire from the US populist right — Elon Musk especially. But the UK always saw itself in a separate category: in the Anglosphere, economically liberal and enjoying a “special relationship” with America.\n\nYet the new attacks focus on Britain’s culture and institutions. The US vice-president JD Vance quips that Labour has turned the UK into an “Islamist country”. Javier Milei, Argentina’s president, parroted the falsehoods that lionise the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, telling Davos delegates that “as we speak, in the UK, citizens are being imprisoned for exposing horrifying crimes committed by Muslim migrants”. Musk’s onslaughts are well-documented and his hostility widely shared on parts of the American right. Ministers soothe themselves with the fact that Trump himself has (so far) refrained from joining the uncoordinated assaults. But even so there are reasons to take it seriously.\n\nThe first is that the UK is floundering. Sir Keir Starmer is unpopular. His new government is facing both ways, increasing taxes and regulation while declaring growth its primary mission. Britain appears up for grabs (as is much of the Anglosphere, with Canada and Australia likely to turn right this year).\n\nSecond, and perhaps most important, this new conservative international is not primarily an economic movement. For sure, the tech billionaires want to undermine a regulatory opponent in Brussels, but Maga’s economics are populist. Its leaders are not troubled if that leads to incoherent policies tailored nationally.\n\nThe movement’s defining feature — as evidenced by the focus on Islam — is cultural nationalism. Immigration is the tip of this spear. What unifies the diverse groups on the right is a central argument that the canon of “Judeo-Christian” western values is threatened from within by multiculturalism and progressivism. From the fear of immigrants to the promotion of policies to boost birth rates, the core premise is that the west must act to save its culture.\n\nAllied to this is the argument that the same guilty liberals have also tilted economic policy against ordinary people, via a deep state that does not even work very well. As European economies stutter, these cultural grievances are accelerated by podcasts and social media.\n\nThere is one other key difference: the decontamination of Trump. This time the new conservative international has major bridgeheads in the UK both in Farage’s Reform UK and much of the Conservative party. Tories who kept their distance in 2016 are now openly supportive. Boris Johnson, shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, Nigel Farage and Liz Truss made pilgrimages to Washington for the inauguration.\n\nPolitical attacks have been encouraged and copied by the British right. Suella Braverman, former home secretary, echoed Vance. Little distinguishes the rhetoric of Robert Jenrick, Tory justice spokesman, from Musk.\n\nBritish radical right voices discern a winning Maga agenda for the UK, based around immigration crackdowns, deporting foreign criminals, scrapping net zero initiatives, pushback on trans rights and cuts to Whitehall bureaucracy. Only in their small-state hostility to the NHS do Britain’s populists offer an exploitable vulnerability.\n\nFurthermore, the electoral system, for so long a bulwark against new and hardline parties, might now actually work to their advantage. Talk of a Reform government is overdone, but the party’s current standing could give it a decisive voice in the next parliament. Fear of Reform is pulling Conservatives on to the same territory. One senior Tory laments “Labour has become too unpopular too quickly. We haven’t had time to rebuild our brand.” Meanwhile, Starmer lacks the communication skills to respond to an assertive right.\n\nAnd victory does not have to be absolute. The movement has already shifted the boundaries. Farage’s surging party is now mainstream and the Conservatives have moved to the right. Progressives within the government find themselves in retreat as ministers fret about the threat of Reform.\n\nIt is early days. Labour may recover. Trump’s lustre may fade. But the conservative international has a new sense of momentum. This movie might yet have a different ending.\n\nrobert.shrimsley@ft.com",

    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "The Bank of England governor has warned that government-backed proposals to water down limits on riskier mortgage lending could trigger more home repossessions and fail to help first-time buyers, even as he announced plans to review the policy.\n\nAndrew Bailey told MPs on Wednesday he was “very happy to have a very open public debate” about the restrictions on UK mortgage lending, but said this should take account of the “better outcomes” the rules had provided in avoiding a surge in home loan defaults during recent shocks.\n\n“They have helped to avoid the creation of a large tail of mortgages, which, when we have the inevitable cyclical downturn or shocks that hit the economy, turn out to be a real problem of the sort we have seen in the past,” Bailey said. “So I think that has been beneficial.”\n\nHis comments indicate the BoE is reluctant to further relax restrictions on British banks’ mortgage lending after having done so as recently as November. The BoE’s sister regulator the Financial Conduct Authority proposed going further earlier this month.\n\nUK chancellor Rachel Reeves backed the FCA’s proposal, telling the Financial Times last week she was “absolutely open to looking at ideas that can boost home ownership and help working families get on the housing ladder”.\n\nReeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have urged all UK regulators, including the BoE and FCA, to do more to support its goal of reviving the country’s stagnant economy by easing the burden of rules on business.\n\nBailey told the Treasury select committee that he supported Starmer’s push to boost growth, but said “there isn’t a trade-off” between this and the BoE’s primary objective of preserving financial stability.\n\nUK mortgage lending is controlled by a mixture of rules from the central bank’s Financial Policy Committee and the FCA, most of which were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis when several banks were bailed out by the state.\n\nThe FPC limits banks above a certain size to lending no more than 15 per cent of mortgages worth more than 4.5 times a household’s income. It changed the lending threshold of this limit in November so it applied to fewer banks.\n\nThe FCA requires banks to carry out affordability tests on applicants for mortgages to ensure they could still afford the monthly repayments if interest rates rose in future. The BoE ditched a similar affordability test in 2022 because it overlapped with the FCA’s rules.\n\nThe FCA said a letter to Starmer this month — in response to a call from the government asking regulators for pro-growth ideas — that it would “begin simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and opening a discussion on the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults”.\n\nBailey said the potential benefits of easing these limits further would have to be balanced against the gains from keeping them. He also warned it may do little to help first-time buyers whose main obstacle to buying a home is frequently the difficulty in affording the necessary deposit.\n\n“In all the surveys that are done, when you ask what is the major impediment to getting into the mortgage market, it is affording the deposit,” said Bailey.\n\nNathanaël Benjamin, the BoE’s executive director for financial stability strategy and risk, told MPs there was still “plenty of headroom” before banks hit the limit on mortgage lending “so that isn’t a barrier”, adding that the proportion of first-time buyers in new mortgage lending was at its highest level for 20 years.\n\nHe also warned that easing limits without increasing the supply of new homes was likely to push up house prices, which would “make things even more difficult for households to get on the housing ladder”.",

    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Harland & Wolff’s new Spanish owner, Navantia, will invest £100mn to reactivate the UK shipbuilder and deliver a key Royal Navy contract while pushing for new orders that will “determine the future of the company”.\n\nDonato Martínez, Navantia’s director of strategy, said on Wednesday the state-owned group aimed to triple H&W’s workforce and invest a further £100mn-£200mn in the coming years, a measure of its long-term commitment to the bankrupt company best known for building the Titanic.\n\nNavantia this week took over H&W’s four shipyards — in Belfast, Appledore in England and two in Scotland — after pushing the UK government to improve the terms of its £1.6bn contract to build three Fleet Solid Support vessels for the Royal Navy.\n\nNeither Navantia nor the UK government said how big the increase was, with Jonathan Reynolds, the UK’s business secretary, insisting only the “absolute minimum of changes to the contract to ensure its continued delivery” were agreed.\n\n“We have not finalised the amendment to the FSS contract [with the UK Ministry of Defence], which is required because obviously the original plan cannot be met with the situation [at H&W],” Martínez told the Financial Times after a ceremony in Belfast to mark the new ownership. He expected that to happen in the next month.\n\nMartínez said he was already eyeing future Royal Navy orders. “Yes, [we can make a profit on FSS], I think we have the basis and the investment,” he said. “The challenge now is to run as fast as we can.”\n\nHe added that Navantia would put in the first £100mn of capex over two years across the four yards, with the bulk being spent in Belfast. Work on an expanded and automated fabrication hall in Belfast has been paralysed since July, when the company’s financial crisis came to a head and a restructuring expert was brought in to find a buyer.\n\nMartínez said that investment would be followed by “a second lap . . . in five years’ time” of £100mn to £200mn. “There is a long-term commitment.”\n\nH&W has 1,015 staff including 560 in Belfast, which has not built a ship since 2003. Martínez said H&W, which was taken over by Navantia UK but has no plans to drop the famous name, needs 1,500 workers.\n\nWhile the initial focus is on the FSS contract — which industry figures believe is now at least a year behind schedule — Navantia has its sights on Royal Navy’s multi-role support ships (MRSS).\n\nMartínez said: “The MRSS is a programme that is really important to capture. It’s going to determine the future of the company . . . We are focused to get as many contracts as possible, including MRSS . . . We are determined to get them.”\n\nThe FSS ships, which Martínez said would have some design changes, are due to be built in parts in Navantia’s yard in Cádiz in southern Spain and at Appledore before being assembled and launched in Belfast. Construction had been due to begin in 2025; Martínez said Appledore would begin cutting steel for the project this year.\n\nThe UK government has hailed Navantia’s rescue of H&W as a boost for the UK shipbuilding industry but some suppliers fear they will be squeezed out and that some work will move to Spain, where Navantia has spare capacity.\n\nMartínez confirmed Navantia, which has spent more than £20mn since October paying salaries and keeping the yards open, would not pay debts outstanding to contractors for past work but hoped for good relations, noting “we need them as much as they need us”.\n\nHe said Navantia aimed to seek a partner to “co-invest’ in Methil, one of the Scottish yards, which will focus on offshore wind projects.\n\nDespite H&W’s choppy history, Martínez was undaunted by the challenge ahead given Spain’s centuries-old maritime tradition.\n\n“We’ve been doing this business for only 400 years,” he said. “I don’t see any reason not to keep doing [it] for another 400 . . . We are very stubborn.”",

Projects at Stansted and City have already been approved.\n\nIf delivered, the expanded airports could handle 309mn passengers annually — an 85 per cent increase on the 167mn travellers who used the airports in 2023, the last year for which there is complete data — according to a Financial Times analysis.\n\nThe scale of the plans shows how airports, and their group of largely international investor owners, are betting that air travel will continue to grow in the coming decades, unencumbered by concerns over carbon emissions.\n\n“The chancellor is right to get behind airports,” said Karen Dee, chief executive of trade association AirportsUK. “Expanding capacity will support growth . . . and will not come at the expense of our sustainability goals.”\n\nBut industry experts said growth of this scale would throw up serious challenges, including the need to redraw the flight paths in the skies over London and the south east of England to accommodate all the extra aircraft, likely impacting new communities with noise pollution.\n\nEnthusiasm from the chancellor also belied barely-concealed tensions within the cabinet that have emerged over the UK’s most contentious infrastructure project in decades.\n\nIf successful, it would also likely make flying more expensive, particularly from Heathrow, as the airport raises the landing fees charged to airlines to recoup the cost of building the runway.\n\nStill, Becrom Basu, a partner at LEK Consulting who has advised Heathrow, said the new capacity would be used.\n\n“The London market has been struggling to meet demand for a while . . . I think investors can be comfortable there will be a business case for that level of demand,” he said.\n\nBy far the most serious challenge is likely to be the impact of airport expansion on the UK’s carbon emissions.\n\n“I find it a bit difficult to see how you could have a third runway at Heathrow and a significant expansion of flight numbers at Gatwick within the government’s carbon budget,” said one person closely involved with the 2015 Conservative government decision to back a third runway at Heathrow. The airport never put forward a planning application because of the pandemic, however.\n\nCasting herself as a chancellor willing to make “bold decisions in the national interest”, Reeves called on Heathrow’s management to put forward plans to build a third runway as soon as this summer.\n\nWhile previous governments had offered lukewarm support to the politically controversial project, Heathrow’s chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he believed the airport would now “sit round the table together” with the government to deliver the third runway.\n\n“We can trust the government, they can be with us for many years,” he said.\n\nWoldbye said the airport will now dust off its 2019 blueprint for expansion, which was shelved when the pandemic struck in 2020. Costed at £14bn in 2014, it involves diverting the nearby M25 motorway into a tunnel, demolishing 750 homes, a primary school and an energy plant.\n\nBut few doubt the scale of the political challenges still facing the project.\n\nEarlier this month energy secretary Ed Miliband said he would not resign if the third runway went ahead, in what appeared to be a capitulation by the project’s biggest cabinet opponent.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Miliband was said to be “livid”, according to one government figure familiar with the situation. He was not among the cabinet ministers at the speech.\n\nOther cabinet ministers were also taken aback by what appeared to be a sudden decision by Reeves several weeks ago. “There really has been a huge row about it, between the Treasury and just about everybody,” said one person close to the discussions.\n\nSome Whitehall officials even suggested Reeves had tried to bounce Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer — who previously voted against the measure — into publicly endorsing the project. He so far avoided doing so, ducking a question on it at last week’s Prime Minister’s Questions session.\n\nDespite Reeves’ warm words, one sceptic inside the government said that Heathrow’s development consent order would still have to pass stringent criteria on climate, air pollution and noise.\n\n“They will still have to reach the same standards that they did 24 hours before this announcement,” they said. “There is a lot of road to run on this.”\n\nMeanwhile long-standing opponent London mayor Sadiq Khan said he remained “simply not convinced that you can have hundreds of thousands of additional flights at Heathrow every year without a hugely damaging impact on our environment”.\n\nRuth Cadbury, Labour MP for Brentford & Isleworth — and chair of the transport select committee — said the committee would now examine “how clear the links between airport expansion and growth” are.\n\nCadbury said she was sceptical that the project could ever meet the four tests set by the government on climate change, regional economic benefits, noise and air pollution.\n\n“The test is whether the project provides growth for UK [businesses] as a whole, for the nations and regions, and does it? Not really,” she said.\n\nReeves, by contrast, insisted the third runway would benefit the entire country.\n\nReeves insisted the expansion was compatible with the government’s “legal, environmental and climate obligations”, as she pointed to technological advances that could pave the way to “cleaner and greener aviation”.\n\nThe aviation industry agrees it can grow while decarbonising. Its road map to net zero 2050, published in 2022, assumes that passenger numbers can still grow while emissions fall.\n\nTo do this it is largely relying on “sustainable aviation fuels” or SAFs, which are made up of a diverse range of sources from crops and used cooking oil to household waste. The industry estimates they can emit about 70 per cent less carbon dioxide over its life cycle than traditional aviation fuel.\n\nBut it is far more expensive than jet fuel and currently only available in tiny quantities. Airline bosses have said the industry will need considerably more government support to scale up the production of SAFs to reach net zero.\n\nColin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit research group, said the government’s hopes that sustainable aviation fuel will offset the extra emissions from Heathrow’s expansion “are unrealistic”.\n\n“A third runway will increase emissions way beyond the capacity of these fuels to offset them,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile planning experts said Heathrow has spent decades unsuccessfully pushing for growth.\n\n“Heathrow would have to run really hard and the government’s decisions would be challenged along the way,” said Alistair Watson, partner and head of planning at Taylor Wessing.\n\n“The only ones who will win from this are lawyers.”",

    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ change of tone on growth has been long in coming. The Labour government’s repeated emphasis since coming to power on its lousy inheritance from 14 years of Conservative rule — though correct — has damaged business and consumer confidence, and made its own task even harder. The UK chancellor has at last begun to construct a more positive and forward-looking narrative. Yet this is a government that still faces two ways on growth. It vaunts its commitment to rekindling the animal spirits of enterprise even as the taxes and regulation it has heaped on to business are impeding the expansion it claims to want.\n\nIf the growth quest is to succeed, one priority must be to demonstrate a joined-up approach across government. Reeves’ statements that economic expansion is the sine qua non of Labour’s entire agenda often seem aimed at convincing fellow ministers as much as the country at large. Prime minister Sir Keir Starmer’s pledge to “hard wire” growth into cabinet decisions, by requiring “growth credentials” to be set out in policy consultations, is positive. But parts of the cabinet’s programme — notably its overcooked employment rights bill — still work against its supposedly overriding priority.\n\nThe government needs to ensure, too, that its enthusiasm for grand projects that may take decades to bear fruit is matched by a zeal to sweep away the constraints on more immediate investment across the economy. Committing to major developments such as the Oxford-Cambridge “growth corridor” and a third runway at Heathrow — provided they are delivered — is important as a way of driving long-term GDP growth. It sends a useful message to overseas investors that Britain remains ambitious and open to business. Business groups are clear that well-planned infrastructure developments create jobs and lasting economic gains.\n\nYet what many companies, especially small and mid-sized businesses that account for half of all private-sector turnover, are interested in above all is faster progress on deregulation, such as easing planning controls on everything from housing to wind farms.\n\nAfter the government ousted the chair of its competition watchdog last week, they want to hear quickly how it plans to strike the elusive balance between a lighter-touch regulatory approach and opening up the risks of abusive corporate behaviour or financial failures. A truly smart approach here could create a competitive advantage over the sclerotic EU, which on Wednesday launched its own effort to slash red tape in the face of Donald Trump’s deregulation drive in the US.\n\nAbove all, however, Labour needs to correct its own mistakes — and lighten the new burdens it heaped on to business by placing the brunt of the £40bn tax increase in its October Budget on to employers and imposing onerous worker rights rules. The government is unlikely to row back on its headline increase in payroll taxes, though it should look again at how inheritance tax changes will hit family businesses. That leaves the employment rights bill as the area most ripe for concessions. Labour must address business concerns over the way it plans to grant day-one protections against unfair dismissal, broaden the rights of those on zero-hour contracts and hand more powers to unions in the workplace.\n\nThere are other areas where more boldness is needed. Labour should rethink the red lines that are hemming in its ability to conclude the ambitious new deal it says it wants with the EU. But if its commitment to its overriding priority is genuine, Labour’s biggest task is to heed what the enterprises that can deliver growth say they need.",

    "body": "A UK-based spy ring gathering intelligence for Russia had links to the “highest echelons” of the Bulgarian government, prosecutors said on Wednesday.\n\nBiser Dzhambazov, 43, told Orlin Roussev, 46, that his relationship with several Bulgarian politicians — such as President Rumen Radev, former deputy prime minister Korneliya Ninova and National Assembly member Boyko Rashkov — was “iron clad”, prosecutors said.\n\nThe pair have both pleaded guilty to conspiring to spy on behalf of Russia.\n\nThe allegations come from the trial of three Bulgarians — Katrin Ivanova, 33, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39 — who have been charged with conspiracy to spy in a ring that prosecutors say was overseen by former Wirecard chief operating officer Jan Marsalek.\n\nProsecutor Alison Morgan KC told the jury at the Old Bailey court in London that the pair were “gleeful” about the outcome of Bulgaria’s November 2021 general election, which the incumbent Radev won, and “could not wait to get started on exploiting those connections”.\n\nIn December 2021, Dzhambazov told Roussev that they had to “work out . . . what we want and what we offer” to the Bulgarian government, adding “I’m sure they won’t let us down”. Roussev replied: “I have a long list.”\n\nThe claims came during the cross-examination of Ivanova, who denies a charge of conspiracy to spy and possessing false identity documents with improper intent.\n\nIvanova has said that she was deceived by Dzhambazov, her partner of 10 years, into taking part in six operations across Europe.\n\nThese include following and spying on the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev — who uncovered Russian links to the 2018 Salisbury attack — to supposedly expose his alleged corruption and links to arms dealers.\n\nMorgan asked why Ivanova had not mentioned her concerns about Grozev to officials at the embassy.\n\nThe court also heard how Ivanova, Dzhambazov and Gaberova volunteered to help with expat voting in the UK during the 2021 Bulgarian elections — yet Ivanova claimed when questioned not to be able to name the Bulgarian president.\n\nShe said her involvement in the election was motivated by a desire to help people “have their voice”, and repeatedly claimed not to know Radev’s name. Morgan attributed this to Ivanova “know[ing] their name features in a pocket of the evidence of this case”.\n\nMorgan asked her: “Did it ever occur to you that you are the corruption?” She added to Ivanova: “When you were going through this process, it is inconceivable that [Dzhambazov] did not mention to you the connections he had to the Bulgarian government.”\n\nThe trial continues.",

    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "The writer is a former Treasury minister\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has made a clear attempt this week to change the narrative about the UK economy and the ability of the Starmer government to help boost it. This was necessary. The negative background mood, after hopes rose ahead of the election and immediately after, relapsed following the October Budget to one of recurrent disappointment, low expectation and dismay at the apparent lack of a narrative.\n\nThe UK has re-entered a period of close to zero economic growth. The hit to business confidence, induced by the Budget, has been compounded by concerns about rising global bond yields and the constraints this places on the government’s ability to spend, and with it, to borrow.\n\nIn her speech, Reeves acknowledged the cost to business from the national insurance increase — and again attempted to explain that she felt it necessary to get the finances under control. But as she pivoted to talk about the supply side, the picture became much more hopeful.\n\nRather than becoming overly stressed about demand management, I believe this supply-side focus is right. First, because much of the demand will be determined by the Bank of England: if interest rates are reduced in the way many forecast, this should be an important driver. So Reeves would not want to take steps to offset this possibility too much — not least because it would probably help bring UK bond yields down.\n\nSecond, as ministers have been eager to tell anyone who will listen, the government is constrained by its own fiscal rules, the first of which limits current spending. If it wants to avoid further tax rises, it will have to stick to them — or something close to them.\n\nThird — and this is especially important — the UK’s problem going right back to the 2008 financial crisis, and before, has always been the supply side. Namely, our woeful productivity and our weak private and public investment. Since the crisis, feeble average growth of 1.5 per cent has been almost completely driven by very strong labour force growth. Productivity growth has remained extremely weak. If we are to have stronger growth while being less inflation-prone, we need more investment and more productivity — it really is that simple.\n\nSo Reeves needs to ensure that the government’s 10-year infrastructure strategy is centre stage from now on.\n\nThe chancellor correctly talked about excessive regulation, planning approval blocks and a lack of commitment to growth-enhancing investment projects. She promised support for a large scattering of projects to address the persistent delays and barriers to infrastructure, including the Ox-Cam project, support for a third runway at Heathrow as well as a number of schemes in the north of England.\n\nWhat was missing was the framework. There was no place in her narrative for the institutions that will be crucial to delivering transparent, high-multiplier investments — and they are not actually yet up and running. But this emphasis will be necessary if the government is to instil confidence in investors.\n\nChancellors always like to announce big attention-catching investments even if, like the Heathrow expansion, they are controversial. Very often, though, these are not accompanied by fresh government capital and are announced on a “trust us” basis in terms of real, lasting benefits.\n\nIn this, Reeves is no exception. She cited Frontier Economics research suggesting that a third runway would have positive multipliers outside the London area — this should become part of the framework for every major initiative. But it must be done systematically, especially as the government will need to observe its second fiscal rule, and borrow to invest. Without such a framework, “trust us” might not get such a positive response from the gilt or equity market.\n\nThe new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority will not be established until April. But this entity, along with the National Audit Office and others, will be absolutely fundamental to encouraging business, inside and outside of the UK, to boost the economy’s growth potential with investments. I am surprised that the chancellor chose not to talk about it: in effect, this will add and support the growth-focused division of the Treasury that both Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer have promised to establish.\n\nIn this spirit, I hope that Reeves will empower Nista to be completely transparent about the investment projects that will have positive multipliers. Because this is also the pathway for indirectly boosting the demand side of the economy, unleashing longer-lasting animal spirits in business and consumers alike.",

    "body": "More than half a dozen major former Conservative donors paid five-figure sums to attend a lavish fundraiser for Reform UK that raised more than £1mn on Tuesday evening.\n\nPast Tory supporters Bassim Haidar and Mohamed Amersi confirmed their presence, and that they had each paid £25,000 for a VIP ticket to the event in order to sit at the top table with party leader Nigel Farage.\n\nHaidar said there were at least eight significant former Conservative donors including himself at the event, while Amersi estimated there were many more “disgruntled Tory donors” at the gathering of about 100 people.\n\nHaidar, a Nigerian-born Lebanese entrepreneur who has given £675,000 to the Conservatives in the past two years, told the FT the event was “a valuable opportunity to learn more about the party’s mission, and I believe they have a good one to ‘make the UK great again’.”\n\nHe said it was “worth considering them as a strong alternative” to the Tories, whose crackdown on non-doms prompted vocal criticism from Haidar last year.\n\nFellow tycoon Amersi, a UK citizen born in Kenya, said the party “certainly appeared far more electable than I would ever have imagined, and Farage was inspirational.” He added: “The energy was electric.”\n\nHe said Nigel Farage’s links to Donald Trump were an “added bonus” and praised property magnate Nick Candy, the former Tory donor who became Reform’s treasurer last month.\n\nAmersi, who has given more than £500,000 to the Tories since 2018, said he remained a Conservative member and would be attending a cocktail party it was hosting on Wednesday night in London, as he wished to keep abreast of developments.\n\nBut he said the Tories were “losing momentum” and accused party leader Kemi Badenoch of having “no policies, no outreach, no connectivity”, adding that she “doesn’t know what ground she is occupying”.\n\nAsked about past Tory donors attending the Reform dinner this week, Badenoch’s spokesperson said on Wednesday: “There are lots of donors out there and we’re looking for new donors all the time, bringing donors back to the party, so we are very confident about our fundraising.”\n\nThey added that the Tory leader is getting the party back on a sure financial footing ready to fight the local elections in May.\n\nMyles Barclay, a young member of the Barclay banking family, and Andrew Reid, the British horse race trainer and former treasurer of the UK Independence party, also attended the dinner, according to two people who attended the event. Neither responded to a request for comment.\n\nOther partygoers paid £10,000 for a seat at the dinner at Oswald’s, an exclusive private members’ club in Mayfair owned by Robin Birley.\n\nBirley himself paid for the food at the event, according to two people briefed on the matter.\n\nGuests were served Dom Pérignon 2012 and Nyetimber English sparkling wine, alongside a menu including lobster and avocado, sea bass, and tarte Tropezienne.\n\nForms requesting additional donations of between £1,000 to £10,000 were left on the tables.\n\nFarage addressed the crowd, declaring “there is no ‘wokery’ in this room”, according to one partygoer.\n\nHe set out the party’s plans to make major gains in the Welsh Senedd elections next year. Reform is set to benefit from changes to the electoral system for the Senedd that will make the result more proportional.\n\nReform came second in 13 of 32 Welsh constituencies at the general election last year, and secured 17 per cent of votes, though it did not win a single seat.\n\nOliver Lewis, the party’s Welsh spokesperson, said this month that he believed Reform could form the new Senedd government in 2026.\n\nThe dinner is the latest signal of Reform’s momentum, after it overtook the Tories in the polls. The latest average shows Farage’s party is one point ahead of the Conservatives and just three points behind Labour.",

    "blurb": "Supermarket is latest UK retailer to caution on Labour government’s tax increases",
    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Supermarket chain WM Morrison has become the latest UK retailer to warn that it will accelerate cost-cutting following the Labour government’s recent tax increases on employers, as the chancellor defended the move.\n\nChief executive Rami Baitiéh, who joined the private equity-owned supermarket in 2023 to revive its fortunes and arrest a decline in sales, said its existing cost-saving programme would be sped up partly in response to chancellor Rachel Reeves’ increases in employers’ national insurance contributions and the national living wage that were unveiled in her October Budget.\n\nBaitiéh said that “with the Budget pressures . . . I’m talking about how we can go harder and deeper” to make the retailer more efficient and productive, having saved £312mn in costs in the year to October 27. Morrisons’ national insurance bill will go up by £75mn a year, he said.\n\nThe grocery chain, which was acquired by US firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice in a leveraged buyout in 2021, had no plans at present to slash jobs, Baitiéh added, after rival Sainsbury’s this month said it would axe 3,000 jobs.\n\nSeparately, Tesco, the UK’s biggest private-sector employer, said on Wednesday that it would cut 400 jobs, affecting bakery roles in some stores, as well as the management of its mobile phone shops. The decision is meant to simplify the business further, said the company, which has more than 330,000 employees, in a statement.\n\nBaitiéh’s comments came as Reeves, in a speech on Wednesday, defended her decision to increase employers’ NICs but acknowledged there were “consequences on business and beyond”.\n\nSeparately, Morrisons boasted about recording the strongest quarterly sales improvement in almost four years, thanks to better product availability and competitive prices that attracted shoppers to its stores.\n\nBut since its financial year ended, growth slowed quarter on quarter after a cyber attack at a technology provider affected availability and subsequently dented Christmas sales.\n\nBaitiéh said: “Nothing in retail is a straight line and that was certainly the case in the first quarter. Our availability is improving, and although it remains above last year, it is not yet back to pre-incident level.”\n\nMorrisons is the UK’s fifth-biggest supermarket by market share. According to industry data this month from Kantar, Morrisons’ sales growth lagged behind Tesco and Sainsbury’s — the UK’s two largest supermarket chains — as well as discounters Aldi and Lidl during the festive period.\n\nMorrisons’ like-for-like sales rose 4.9 per cent in its fourth quarter to October 27, the strongest quarter since the start of 2021, compared with a 3.3 per cent increase during the same quarter the previous year.\n\nGroup full-year like-for-like sales were up 4.1 per cent, while total revenue increased 3.8 per cent to £15.3bn. Underlying profits, its preferred metric, rose 11.2 per cent to £835mn, the company said.\n\nAnnual pre-tax loss broadly halved to about £500mn, according to finance chief Jo Goff, and net debt has fallen to about £3bn, from £5.5bn “at peak”. Its annual interest payments are about £250mn a year, she added.\n\nLast year Morrisons agreed a deal to sell its petrol forecourt business to Motor Fuel Group, also owned by CD&R, with the majority of the £2.5bn proceeds used to pay down its debt.\n\nEleanor Simpson-Gould, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: “Morrisons has begun to emerge from a bleak period of meagre sales and mounting debt with a strengthened balance sheet.”",

    "body": "Two conflicting thoughts about DeepSeek seem plausible right now. Forced to be resourceful, China is starting to expose the artificial intelligence sector of the US as flabby and coddled. Alternatively, don’t panic, America: the brute scale of US capital will tell in the end, as will the nation’s openness to foreign talent.\n\nEither way, notice the absence of a third horse from all the discussion this week. You wouldn’t know that Europe accounts for a comparable share of world economic output to China and the US. Whatever the feats of such companies as Mistral, the continent’s role in AI — in fact, its place in the world — is increasingly that of an infant watching both parents squabbling overhead.\n\nHow has it come to this? Over-regulation of business, say some. Or a far from complete single market, which means that close to half a billion people (who are well-off by world standards) count for less than they should. Yet a third speculation is that Europe lacks an entrepreneurial culture. Whatever relative weight you accord these factors, notice that each one is to some extent a choice. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Europe’s “revealed preference” is to forfeit some economic dynamism for other things.\n\nThis is why, despite their best efforts, Elon Musk and other Silicon Valley moguls around Donald Trump will struggle to shape Europe. Their techno-libertarianism has much less purchase on the other side of the Atlantic, even — or especially — among the hard right. Who can imagine Marine Le Pen, supporter of free public transport for young workers, freezing government grants and loans as Trump tried to do this week? Even Giorgia Meloni, a pro-market reformer of sorts, has spent much of the time since the pandemic disbursing EU funds.\n\nIn Europe, nationalism is bound up with paternalism to a degree that is alien to the US experience. (Imperial Germany under Bismarck pioneered the welfare state.) The UK isn’t an exception. Brexit was, in part, a bet that British people are essentially Americans in their relish for capitalism, if only the dead hand of Brussels would let them go. Well, the fifth anniversary of the formal exit is this Friday. Still no UK government has felt politically safe to cut much regulation. Even the flintiest Tory must know that, if a single day were shaved off the statutory paid leave allowance, say, there would be pandemonium, much of it among Brexit voters. To be “rightwing” in Europe and America just means different things.\n\nEven within the Trump government, the tech bros are at philosophical odds with the pro-worker Maga base. But at least the two camps can come together over American jingoism. What is going to glue Musk to Europe’s hard right? A shared position on certain cultural issues? It doesn’t seem enough to paper over such wildly different visions of the proper relationship between the individual and the state. Granted, both sides have an interest in the paralysis or destruction of the EU: it would spare Silicon Valley a lot of regulation. But the idea that tech would get an easier ride from a fragmented, populist-led Europe could only be entertained by someone with no knowledge of, say, Le Pen’s economic platform over the years.\n\nThe attempt to build a transatlantic club of populists isn’t new. Another Trump associate, Steve Bannon, tried it in the past decade. These projects tend to fall short for a reason that shouldn’t need spelling out. If a movement’s core idea is national assertiveness, the various branches of it around the world will almost by definition come into conflict. One nation’s expansionist territorial claims affect another’s. The desire of Strongman X to push his tech companies into foreign markets rubs against Strongman Y’s security paranoia and amour propre. The Russo-Japanese war, Operation Barbarossa, the Sino-Soviet split: liberalism owes its survival in large part to the innate fissiparousness of those who hate it. Trump, Le Pen and the like aren’t monsters on anything approaching that scale. But the principle that jingoists tend to fall out, must fall out, holds. There won’t be a Nationalist International.\n\nNot long ago, self-respecting European reactionaries almost defined themselves against the US, which they saw as both culturally imperial and culturally empty. Even in the cold war, when the alternative was communism, parts of the continental right stood aloof. At least US Republicans used to notice the snub, and mind. Now? No head of government in the EU is closer to China than Viktor Orbán of Hungary. Yet no head of government in the EU is more beloved of America’s anti-China hard right. Whether this double game says more about his wiliness or the attention span of today’s Republicans, it is a lesson in how differently a European populist can see geopolitics from an American.\n\nThis isn’t a call for liberals to relax. The US right has the resources to put more than a thumb on the scales of European politics. With a federal election close, the Alternative for Germany is being magnified through the personal attention of Musk. But these are tactics. A more lasting alliance, an American-exported revolution, assumes a harmony of worldview that isn’t there. If the European hard right succeeds, it won’t be on account of outsiders whose very foreignness might incur a backlash. Liberalism has always been able to count on its enemies turning their belligerence on each other.\n\njanan.ganesh@ft.com",

    "body": "Get Britain building again! In any conversation about the UK’s ability to construct large, growth-boosting infrastructure projects — or not — a third runway at Heathrow tops the list of missed opportunities. Efforts to expand the west London hub date back decades.\n\nThat makes it an obvious target for UK chancellor Rachel Reeves, who wants to persuade investors and businesses that her government is pro-growth. The difficulty is convincing them that a third runway can actually be delivered.\n\nOn paper, there are some sound economic arguments to support expansion. Heathrow is not only the UK’s busiest airport, catering to an estimated 83.8mn passengers in 2024, it is also the country’s largest port by value.\n\nEven with its current two runways it has kept increasing passenger numbers, breaking a fresh record in November. Yet further growth, through small changes such as persuading airlines to switch to bigger jets, will have limits. Flights are capped at 480,000 annually. Slots to launch new routes are constrained; the airport is running at 99 per cent capacity.\n\nThere are soft benefits, too. Almost any traveller will have a story about delays or flight cancellations at Heathrow — in part a symptom of its capacity constraints.\n\nTrue, there are five other “London” airports that airlines can choose from, if Southend in Essex is included. But Heathrow is a favourite for long-haul carriers as transfer traffic makes certain routes economically viable.\n\nIn reality, though, the barriers remain huge. A previous Labour administration approved a third runway at the airport in 2009. A shovel is yet to hit the ground.\n\nEven if the weighty concerns of environment campaigners and west London residents could be swept aside, the cost and how it can be funded without making passengers and airlines balk are still big unknowns. Even in 2014, when Heathrow forecast the cost at close to £14bn, others reckoned this was an underestimation. Airlines are wary of how much charges — passed on to passengers — would have to rise to fund the returns private investors would demand.\n\nOf course impasses over big, tricky projects have been broken before. Nuclear power plants in the UK had a similar stop-start history, which ended in 2016 when Theresa May’s government gave the go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C plant in south-west England. But now over-time and over-budget, it may not be a comparison the government is keen to make.\n\nWhat’s obvious, though, is this isn’t really about near-term growth at all — rather the perception of growth. With UK businesses deeply gloomy about the consequences of Budget tax changes this year, it is little wonder the chancellor is grasping for any levers she can to get the endorphins going.\n\nnathalie.thomas@ft.com",

    "blurb": "Boss of hub calls timetable for expansion ‘ambitious, but not undoable’",
    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK chancellor Rachel Reeves has urged Heathrow airport to fast-track proposals to build a third runway, in a much-trailed speech that sought to reinvigorate the Labour government’s growth agenda.\n\nReeves said the government hoped to grant planning permission to Heathrow’s expansion by the end of the current parliament in 2029, a target the airport’s boss told the Financial Times was “ambitious, but not undoable”.\n\nThe chancellor said expanding Heathrow would “unlock further growth, boost investment, increase exports and make Britain more open and more connected” in a speech on her plans to boost the flatlining UK economy.\n\n“I can confirm today that this government supports a third runway at Heathrow and is inviting proposals to be brought forward by the summer,” Reeves said.\n\nThomas Woldbye, chief executive of Heathrow, the UK’s largest airport, told the FT he was confident the hub would put forward detailed proposals on that timeline. He added that the earliest the third runway could be completed would be the mid-2030s if everything went to plan.\n\n“The target is to have planning permission by the end of this parliament. That is ambitious, but not undoable, seen from our point of view,” he said.\n\nWoldbye added: “We are standing on, if you like, a huge body of work that has been done in the past 10 years. If we didn’t have that, we wouldn’t be able to do that, because this is a huge and complicated project.”\n\nHeathrow’s pre-pandemic blueprint was for a multibillion-pound megaproject that would include diverting the M25 motorway into a tunnel to make room for the new runway. In the process, 750 homes and a primary school would be demolished.\n\nReeves said airport expansion was compatible with the government’s legally binding net zero 2050 target, pointing to “cleaner and greener flying” through so-called sustainable aviation fuels.\n\nSir Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said he “remained opposed” to a new runway.\n\n“I’m simply not convinced that you can have hundreds of thousands of additional flights at Heathrow every year without a hugely damaging impact on our environment,” he said.\n\nThe government’s push for airport expansion has also alarmed local residents and environmental groups.\n\n“Instead of picking up any old polluting project from the discard pile, the chancellor should focus on industries that can attract investment and bring wider economic and social benefits,” said Greenpeace UK’s policy director Doug Parr.\n\nExpansion plans at London’s Gatwick and Luton airports are further ahead in the planning process than Heathrow. Transport secretary Heidi Alexander is expected to greenlight their proposals by spring.\n\nIn her speech in Oxfordshire on Wednesday, Reeves stressed her determination to “grow the supply side of our economy”, outlining a three-pillar approach built on stability, reform and investment.\n\n“Growth will not come without a fight, without a government willing to take the right decisions now to change our country’s future for the better,” she said.\n\nReeves also confirmed plans to make Oxford and Cambridge “Europe’s Silicon Valley”, with new transport links between the university towns, as well as support for a proposed regeneration scheme around Manchester United’s stadium at Old Trafford.\n\nBusiness leaders have previously criticised the Labour government for introducing measures that executives say will hit growth, including a £25bn national insurance increase on employers and new labour laws.\n\nReeves defended the tax rises as necessary given the government’s fiscal inheritance and declined to answer a question on whether she was ruling out further taxes on businesses.\n\nReacting to the speech, Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers’ organisation Make UK, warned that the government needed to resolve the contradiction between the Budget tax rises and the ambitions set out by the chancellor.\n\n“There is a clear contradiction between implementing laudable measures such as planning reform and infrastructure investment whilst, at the same time, applying a handbrake through measures which will inevitably reduce investment and freeze recruitment. This is a clear dichotomy that government needs to resolve internally,” he said.\n\nThe chancellor also stood by Labour’s flagship workers’ rights package.\n\nThe measures could cost businesses up to £5bn a year, according to the government’s own analysis and have been heavily opposed by industry, but Reeves argued they would bolster growth.\n\n“A secure workforce is a more confident, more productive workforce and also more confident to spend in the economy,” she said.\n\nShe insisted that deputy prime minister Angela Rayner and business secretary Jonathan Reynolds have “worked closely with business to understand their concerns”, including on probation periods and the flexibility to take on workers during busy times, such as school holidays.\n\nIn a bid to reassure industry, she said the bill that the government takes through parliament “will reflect those concerns so that we get the balance right, supporting working people and supporting businesses”.\n\nAdditional reporting by Peter Foster in London and Jennifer Williams in Manchester",

    "blurb": "Separate bodies tasked with tackling specific ideologies can lead to twisted incentives",
    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Good morning. Rachel Reeves has a big speech today in which she will promise to go “further and faster” to increase UK economic growth. (Our story here.) However, I will wait until after the chancellor’s address before giving my thoughts, as I prefer not to analyse speech extracts.\n\nThere is still more to be said about the government’s options for tweaking our counterterrorism response following the Southport murders. One aspect of that was the subject of an urgent question in the House of Commons yesterday. So today, I want to talk about the benefits of keeping those changes within the walls of the UK’s existing counterterrorism capabilities or as an extension to it.\n\nPrevent was established in the wake of the 2005 bombings in London, in which the perpetrators were all British-born. Its brief then was solely to focus on Islamist extremist terror, which makes up roughly 75 per cent of MI5’s counterterrorism caseload in the UK. Since then, Prevent’s remit has been expanded to include other forms of extremism, most importantly from a resource perspective the extreme far-right, which makes up almost all of the remainder of MI5’s caseload.\n\nSome critics of the programme argue that this broadening of scope waters down Prevent’s focus and thus its effectiveness. I think there’s some truth in this, but there’s a trade-off either way. One reason why I favour keeping all the extremist ideologies under one hat is that very few organisations advocate for their own abolition. As I’ve written a lot lately, violent animal rights activists, who in the 2000s represented a serious threat both to the life of scientific researchers and to the ability of the UK to actually deliver scientific advances, have been pretty comprehensively routed by the British security services.\n\nI’m not saying that violent animal rights activists are never going to re-enter the scene, but I am saying that, at present, they aren’t a big threat in the UK. I think the nature of human affairs is that, if a separate part of the UK’s counterterrorism apparatus were dealing with violent animal rights activists, they would be talking up this threat to ensure their continued relevance, engaging in turf wars with other bits of the security services and generally this would drain resources and time to no good end.\n\nSimilarly, a stripped down Prevent is not going to unlock greater time and resources to tackle the problem of people who support or commit acts of terror because they are Islamist extremists. It is going to spend that time having bureaucratic battles with whatever organisation you set up to address the problem of people who support or commit acts of terror because they are on the extreme right, the extreme left, and various other causes that are currently marginal in the UK.\n\nWe may not ever be able to comprehensively defeat either Islamist extremists or the extreme far right, as we currently have done to violent animal rights activists. But it is at least theoretically arguable we shouldn’t create organisations that are incentivised to pretend that we have not prevailed.\n\nViolence for violence’s sake, however, which typifies many spree killers and school shooters, and was the case for Axel Rudakubana, is a perennial policy problem. No state has a clear sense of how to stop that problem entirely and it may well simply be part of the human condition. A separate focus on those committing violent acts for their own sake wouldn’t have the same risks of obsolescence later down the line — but would, of course, still be competing for resources.\n\nI had a lovely dinner last night courtesy of Martin Sandbu, but I did not, alas, have the presence of mind to ask for his recipe book.

    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sixteen climate activists will call for judges to reduce their prison sentences on Wednesday in a rare mass appeal, which their supporters argue will define Britain’s approach to peaceful protest for years to come.\n\nThe Court of Appeal in London will review the jail sentences related to four separate cases given to activists from climate protest group Just Stop Oil between July and September 2024, who claim the terms were excessive and breach international human rights.\n\nThis includes a five-year term for Roger Hallam, 58, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion (XR) and JSO, for taking part in a Zoom call to plan a protest on the M25 motorway that brought the London ring road to a standstill over four days.\n\nThe two-day appeal comes as activists, lawyers and academics warn of a legislative and judicial clampdown on climate protest that has spread from the UK across western nations.\n\nA study by academics at Bristol university last year found that environmental protesters in the UK were arrested at three times the global average rate, with 17 per cent of such protests leading to arrests compared with 6.7 per cent internationally.\n\nThe court’s ruling is being watched closely by other countries, according to Tim Crosland, an ex-government lawyer and director of Plan B, the climate-focused legal charity. “If the UK can get away with lengthy jail sentences for peaceful protest, other countries will think they can, too,” he said.\n\nThe increasingly confrontational climate protest movement, frustrated with the slow pace at which countries are addressing global warming, has drawn hundreds of thousands to marches around the world. Some groups have gained notoriety for headline-grabbing stunts, from throwing soup at works of art to breaking bank office windows.\n\nThe restrictions on protest and longer jail times across the world have sparked fears among academics and civil rights organisations of far-reaching consequences that could limit not just climate activists but the ability of any citizen to protest against any government, business or policy in the future.\n\nThe UN’s rapporteur for environmental defenders Michel Forst told the Financial Times: “Disproportionate sanctions for protests . . . have a significant adverse impact on the most fundamental freedoms.\n\n“Not only of those who are personally criminalised for protesting, but also on every person concerned who would like to take part in protests but is deterred from doing so, by fear of being fined, tried, arrested or imprisoned for that.”\n\nThe appellants argue that their “conscientious motivation” should have been taken into account during sentencing under both common and European human rights laws, while also questioning whether throwing soup at glass is an act of violence.\n\nThe UK has been at the forefront of attempts to curb protesters, according to academics, activists and non-profits. Until the emergence of activist group XR in 2018 and later JSO and Insulate Britain, which campaigns for greater energy efficiency, the country had little history of jailing non-violent climate protesters.\n\nOscar Berglund, a lecturer at Bristol university and specialist on climate activism, said protesters had been “targeted because they are effective to some extent”.\n\nThe initial “great wave” of climate protests in 2019, with the emergence of XR and Fridays for Future, played a strong role in raising political and public awareness of climate change, said Andrew Firmin of Civicus, a non-profit group focused on strengthening citizen action.\n\nThe UK target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 was at least partially influenced by the climate protest movement, he said.\n\nBut critics say the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act of 2022 and the Public Order Act of 2023 have made it increasingly difficult to hold non-violent but disruptive protests, while also allowing for longer sentences.\n\nA report led by Lord Walney, commissioned by the previous government, called for a ban on extremist protest groups, arguing the “battle against climate change [has] been hijacked” by those “determined to bypass democratic norms and cause maximum disruption to society”.\n\nThe Labour government declined to comment. Before being elected, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he backed stiff sentences for climate protesters who blocked roads.\n\nAmong those appealing against their sentences this week are 78-year-old grandmother and retired teacher Gaie Delap. Last year, she was jailed for 20 months for climbing on to gantries over the M25, but later released early. Before Christmas she was recalled to prison after no electronic tag — a condition of her early release — was available to fit her wrist.\n\nPhoebe Plummer, 23, who threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers”, is also appealing against her two-year sentence.\n\nIn other cases, protesters have been jailed without being found guilty of their alleged crimes. This includes 39-year-old Amy Pritchard.\n\nDuring her trial for public nuisance for blocking traffic, the presiding judge banned the defendants from mentioning climate change — Pritchard defied the order, intending to explain to the jury what had motivated her actions.\n\nWhile jurors failed to reach a verdict, the judge, Silas Reid, sentenced her to seven weeks in jail for contempt of court.\n\n“There are people who say that what he did was completely . . . justified, to separate the law and motivations,” said Pritchard, but she felt the ban was “outrageous”. “For my understanding of the legal process, you go there to explain why you did what you did.”\n\nPritchard received another jail sentence for criminal damage last year for cracking a window at a JPMorgan office.\n\nA report from Climate Rights International, a non-profit, in September also warned of heavy-handed treatment of climate protesters in Australia, the US, Germany, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden.\n\n“We are seeing this [crackdown] in global north countries that have positioned themselves internationally as climate leaders,” said Firmin. “Governments have closed down the space for protest.”\n\nBut other senior figures said there was a balance to be struck. “There is a very wide envelope within which people can protest legitimately and lawfully,” said Sir Robert Buckland, former lord chancellor and Conservative justice secretary.\n\n“The interests of freedom of speech are very important, but so are the rights and freedoms of other people who find their lives are disrupted.”\n\nWhile officials argue that the crackdown is needed to deter protesters, it is also making some activists more resolute, said Linda Lakhdhir, legal director at Climate Rights International.\n\n“Many protesters are going to worry more, think twice . . . [but] some people will think: ‘If I have to go to jail, I will go to jail. I am doing this for the future of my children’,” she added.\n\nThat urgency has increased following the re-election of US President Donald Trump, who called climate change a hoax, said Dana Fisher, director of the Center for Environment, Community and Equity at American University. The US is the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n“Movements actually work better when they’re pushing back against a common enemy,” she added.\n\nFisher said that historically social protest movements either “peter out and give up”, often as their cause becomes less of an issue, or they “radicalise until they achieve their goals”, as was seen with the suffragettes and the civil rights movement.\n\nJust Stop Oil said the group expected more people to take to the streets as the effects of climate change became more apparent, and that Labour was not doing enough to tackle climate change.\n\n“As the consequences play out, as farming collapses, as millions are flooded and social order breaks down, as the risk of ruin becomes apparent the number of those prepared to act to defend our traditions, heritage and hard won rights will increase,” the group said.\n\nMore than 1,000 people are expected to occupy the Strand outside the Royal Courts of Justice, where the appeal is being heard on Thursday lunchtime. Television personalities Chris Packham and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and singer-songwriter Billy Bragg are among those due to attend.\n\nAhead of the appeal, XR spokesperson Zoe Cohen said: “It is shameful that the new government has not yet repealed these laws and restored the right of ordinary people to effective protest. We can push back against this repression when we come together to peacefully resist.”",

    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK ministers are drawing up plans to subsidise electric car purchases by guaranteeing consumer loans, as they look at ways to drive up sales that remain stubbornly below official targets.\n\nThe government has opened private discussions with the auto finance sector to try to increase the availability of low-interest or interest-free loans to help boost the take-up of electric vehicles, according to government and industry figures.\n\nOne option being discussed is for the state to underwrite private sector loans to reduce the monthly repayments to help bring EV purchase costs to levels closer to petrol or diesel vehicles, the people said.\n\nThe move would be welcomed by the car industry — which has struggled to sell EVs in volumes required by government targets — and would be tantamount to an admission that the consumer subsidies scrapped in 2022 were phased out too early.\n\nAlthough EVs remain more expensive to buy outright than traditional engine-driven vehicles, more than 80 per cent of the new cars in the UK are bought using finance or lease deals, according to the Finance & Leasing Association.\n\nCarmakers have been urging ministers to introduce new demand-side measures to encourage consumers to buy more electric cars, as well as to accelerate the rollout of charging points.\n\nSales of EVs are growing in the UK, but remain far below official targets, and are concentrated in the company car sector, where generous tax incentives still exist.\n\nCar manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Ford and Renault are under pressure to hit stretching targets for EV sales under the government’s “zero-emission vehicle mandate”, which requires a certain percentage of each carmakers’ annual sales to be zero-emission vehicles.\n\nThe percentage is set to rise from 28 per cent this year to 80 per cent in 2030, with companies facing fines of £15,000 for each missed vehicle.\n\nStellantis last year said the costs of complying with the scheme was partly behind its decision to close its Luton van factory, putting 1,100 jobs at risk, while Ford also blamed the mandate as it cut 800 UK roles last year in a wider European restructuring.\n\nEVs accounted for 19.6 per cent of new cars sold in the UK last year, which was below the required 22 per cent target, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.\n\nThe government is currently consulting the auto industry on how to improve the “arrangements and flexibilities” in the scheme to try to give manufacturers more breathing space.\n\nMinisters are unlikely to bring back cash incentives for EV purchases because of the direct cost to the Treasury. The previous plug-in car grant scheme, which paid out £5,000 for an EV, was reduced over time and eventually scrapped in 2022 by the Conservative government.\n\nThe potential intervention on EVs comes after Labour chancellor Rachel Reeves weighed into a Supreme Court case to prevent the motor finance sector having to pay out billions in compensation to consumers.\n\nThe rise of pay-monthly deals for car purchases has transformed the country’s auto finance sector. The most popular finance deal is called a “personal contract purchase”, which is a pay-monthly scheme that sees motorists finance the value a vehicle loses over three years rather than the total cost of the car.\n\nThe collapse in used prices for electric vehicles in the past two years means that EV repayments are typically higher than for petrol cars.\n\nAdrian Dally, FLA’s motor finance director, said zero-interest loans would not fully equalise the cost between EVs and internal combustion vehicles, but he added: “If there was a way where the government could underwrite cheaper loans . . . that would be extremely helpful.”\n\nThe impact of the scheme on the public finances will depend on how the UK decides to structure any support. Ministers hope that a change in the government’s debt target to a new measure called “public sector net financial liabilities” — that counts more assets alongside public liabilities — could help the proposal.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson declined to comment on the Financial Times report, but said 2024 was a “record year for switching to electric” with 382,000 EVs sold and nearly 20,000 public chargers added to the network.\n\n“We’re investing over £2.3bn to support industry and consumers make the switch.”",

    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer’s plan to agree a security pact with the EU is being blocked by French and other member states’ demands over fishing rights and a youth mobility scheme, complicating hopes of an early win in “reset” talks with Brussels.\n\nIn recent weeks, UK efforts to sign a bilateral security and defence partnership with the European Commission have met growing opposition from EU capitals that want to link it to a broader package of agreements, officials from both sides said.\n\nA senior UK government official said: “Over the last four or five weeks it has become clear that it won’t happen without early assurances on fish and mobility. We’re back to the ‘nothing agreed until everything is agreed’ world.”\n\nEU officials confirmed that member states, led by France, had bogged down the talks over the reset, refusing to engage on the security pact unless the UK offered guarantees on the bloc’s demands for continued fishing rights and a youth mobility deal.\n\n“Everything is now seen as a quid pro quo,” said an EU official with knowledge of preparations for the opening reset summit that is expected in the first half of the year.\n\nAnother EU official said: “[Member states] largely expect that a form of security and defence relationship with the UK will only advance in tandem with other parts of any reset package.”\n\nThe stand-off between the two sides emerged as Starmer prepared to attend a meeting of the European Council’s 27 EU leaders on February 3, for an informal gathering in Brussels devoted to defence and security co-operation.\n\nThe meeting will be the first time a British prime minister has met with all EU leaders since Brexit.\n\nThe UK had hoped to secure the security partnership — a legally non-binding deal of a type the EU has with six countries, including Norway, South Korea and Japan — as a launch pad for other negotiations covering trade, energy and fishing.\n\nOne UK official acknowledged that fishing rights would be a knotty issue in the talks, but said: “The French are in the minority — and they’re not what they once were.”\n\nThe mooted security deal was partly prompted by widespread concern over the future of Europe’s security architecture triggered by Russia’s war against Ukraine and a US pivot towards Asia.\n\nIt envisages establishing regular dialogues between the EU high representative for foreign affairs and the UK foreign secretary, as well as high-level political agreements to work together on matters such as Ukraine, the Balkans and the Asia-Pacific.\n\nHowever, the EU has been clear that any rapprochement with London must be predicated on the UK guaranteeing the same level of access to British fishing grounds as under a current deal that expires in June 2026.\n\n“Fishing is very important and very political for some member states,” said a third EU official. “It is also a litmus test. If the UK wants a reset and it cannot compromise on a sector that is not very economically important, then why would we give anything?”\n\nThe UK Labour party has promised to “tear down the barriers” to trade with Europe, but has set “red lines” ruling out rejoining the EU single market, customs union or a return to free movement of people.\n\n“It’s a little perplexing for the Brits to claim things are stalled when they can’t tell us exactly what they want to achieve,” said a fourth EU official. “A defence deal as a first positive signal is fine. But a positive signal for what?”\n\nUK ambitions have until recently been limited to signing a veterinary agreement to reduce border red tape for animal and plant products, a deal for recognising professional qualifications and an accord to make it easier for touring artists to play in the EU.\n\nHowever, Britain has recently signalled it may go further, within its red lines, by looking to re-link the UK and EU’s carbon markets and being open to joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention, a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries.\n\nThe EU has made clear that a youth mobility agreement to allow for 18 to 30-year-olds to study and work in the UK — which Brussels is calling a youth experience scheme — is vital to any wider reset with the UK.\n\nStarmer has repeatedly ruled out such a deal, saying it would contradict Labour’s election manifesto promise not to return to free movement of people that Brexit ended, but some UK ministers are privately confident a “landing zone” will be found.\n\nThe UK Cabinet Office said it would not provide a running commentary on reset talks, while noting the EU and Britain faced a common set of security challenges.\n\n“As part of resetting our relationship with our European neighbours we continue to work towards strengthening co-operation on areas of mutual benefit, such as on security,” a spokesperson added.\n\nA French official said the position of Paris had long been that after Brexit the UK could not “cherry pick” parts of EU policy or regulation, and added that this stance was widely shared among member states.\n\n“Security and defence cannot be separated from the rest,” said the official, citing migration, energy, mobility and fishing as issues that also needed resolution before any security pact with the UK.\n\nOlof Gill, a European Commission spokesman, said: “We look forward to the UK defining its priorities, including on defence and security, and will engage on that basis.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Leila Abboud",

    "blurb": "Economists say chancellor needs to revive ‘animal spirits’ as she confronts poor productivity and lacklustre investment",
    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "The chancellor will on Wednesday declare that the UK’s low growth “is not our destiny” in a speech pledging to bolster the country’s economic potential.\n\nRachel Reeves’ initiatives will include a scheme to better link the high-productivity areas of Oxford and Cambridge, alongside plans for new rail projects and reservoirs.\n\nBut the backdrop to her speech is a decidedly gloomy one, after the economy flatlined in the second half of 2024 and business confidence ebbed in the wake of tax hikes in October’s Budget.\n\nThe UK is estimated to have failed to grow in the second half of last year, after a relatively strong start to 2024. Output is likely to undershoot the Office for Budget Responsibility’s outlook for 2025 as well, with the IMF predicting an expansion of 1.6 per cent in its latest outlook.\n\nOne of the factors dragging on growth was the UK’s “very poor international trade performance”, said Andrew Wishart, economist at Berenberg, with total exports falling while they held steady in other major economies. The UK’s high production costs weighed on the export sector, he added, as companies face some of the highest electricity costs in the developed world alongside unusually big increases in labour costs.\n\nAt the same time, the leading services sector stopped contributing to overall growth. Services lifted growth at the start of 2024, with an expansion of 0.9 per cent in the first quarter, but registered no growth in the three months to September and the three months to November, the latest available data.\n\nAlan Taylor, a member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, has warned of “ebbing confidence” due to a “cash flow squeeze” being felt by both businesses and households, in the form of tax hikes and continued high mortgage costs.\n\nBusiness groups say that elements of Labour’s Budget in October made this uninspiring picture worse.\n\nReeves’ decision to raise £25bn via an increase in employer national insurance contributions, coupled with a sharp increase in the national living wage, has added to employment costs and dragged sharply on business sentiment.\n\nThere are increasing signs that businesses will shed staff as they attempt to keep costs under control. The S&P Global flash purchasing managers’ survey last Friday showed the net share of businesses reducing staff numbers in January and December was the highest since the global financial crisis in 2009, apart from the start of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nSushil Wadhwani, a former Bank of England rate-setter, said Reeves had “lost the growth narrative” partly as a result of the tax hike on businesses, adding that the decision had also muddied the labour market outlook for the BoE as it weighs how rapidly to cut interest rates.\n\n“This is a lot about animal spirits, and she damaged animal spirits,” said Wadhwani.\n\nAll this comes in the context of a weak longer-term picture in the UK, in particular moribund productivity. Output per hour worked for April to June 2024 decreased by 0.9 per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago, according to the ONS.\n\nCompared with Q4 2019, before the pandemic, output per hour worked rose only by 0.8 per cent, according to the latest figures, well below the 2 per cent previously estimated. This is particularly weak compared with the US, where labour productivity rose by 8.3 per cent over the same period, buoyed by factors including strong corporate investment and a booming tech sector.\n\nBusiness investment has been lacklustre, particularly during a long period of stagnation following the Brexit referendum in 2016.\n\nIn the three months to September 2024, business investment was up 5.7 per cent compared with the same period the previous year, according to official data. But it was up by the same amount in the eight years since early 2016, reflecting the lack of growth after the vote to leave the EU and the contraction during the pandemic.\n\nThis is a much weaker rate than in the US, where private non-residential fixed investment has risen by 40 per cent since 2016. And in the eight years before the Brexit referendum, UK business investment rose by about 26 per cent.\n\nReeves has been pledging radical changes to the UK’s planning system to unlock more infrastructure projects and housebuilding, as well as reforms to better tap into pension savings.\n\nShe has been signalling her support for a third runway at Heathrow airport to boost connectivity, alongside support for a so-called Oxford-Cambridge Arc that would bolster output in the science-rich region.\n\nAn industrial strategy focusing on key sectors including advanced manufacturing, creative industries such as film and TV, and financial services will follow in the spring.\n\nWith Donald Trump vowing to slash regulation in the US, the UK government has also been promising business it will hack away at red tape, including easing constraints on mortgage lending and a change of leadership at the competition regulator.\n\nA new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority has been announced to get to grips with endemic project delays.\n\nJim O’Neill, a former Treasury minister and Goldman Sachs economist, said it was critical for the chancellor to convince the private sector that the UK’s trend rate of growth can be lifted, and that meant explaining the value of her strategy to boost investment.\n\nThe poor growth rate reflects weak investment and productivity, said O’Neill. “Her framework in principle is designed to deal with that but they have to be serious about it and make sure anyone who will be a co-investor believes it.”\n\nWadhwani said he doubted the short-term picture would improve unless Reeves “breaks the expectation” that taxes will have to go up again given the weak state of the public finances.\n\nProgress in lowering barriers to trade with the EU, the UK’s biggest market, would deliver a positive jolt to sentiment, he added.\n\nMichael Saunders, of Oxford Economics, said many of Reeves’ policies on public and private investment made sense, but did not go far enough. The government needed to focus on bolstering investment in intangible assets, not just physical ones, he said.\n\nAnd it was likely to run up against shortages of construction workers given the breadth of its infrastructure and housing ambitions, he added, which meant devising a convincing labour force development plan.\n\n“A broader strategy for potential growth is needed,” he said. That means “making the case for supply-side policies that pay off over 10 to 20 years”.\n\nData visualisation by Keith Fray",

    "blurb": "Reducing scheme credited with boosting maths performance in England is retrograde step, say critics ",
    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government is to cut back a hugely successful programme designed to encourage teenagers to take up higher-level maths courses, causing dismay among charities and campaign groups.\n\nThe Advanced Mathematics Support Programme, which has been running since 2018, helps state schools in England teach A-level maths, further maths and a core maths programme that provides “maths for life” skills, such as statistics and finance.\n\nGovernment officials said the “difficult decision” to reduce the programme budget had been taken as Whitehall sought to address the “£22bn black hole” in the public finances Labour said it inherited from the Conservative administration.\n\nThe plan to halve the budget of the widely praised scheme from April this year was described as a retrograde step by leading maths campaigners at a time when the government was promoting its new AI and digital technology strategies as the key to the UK’s growth prospects.\n\nJens Marklof, president of the London Mathematical Society, said the decision to pare back the scheme would harm the chances of children from poorer areas, where schools were less likely to offer further maths A-levels needed to access higher-tier universities.\n\n“There’s no AI without maths and if the government is really serious about its AI strategy they have to significantly scale up the support for maths education at all levels,” he said.\n\n“The big success of AMSP was to enable kids who went to schools that didn’t offer further maths to give them this opportunity,” he added.\n\nSir Adrian Smith, Royal Society president, said it would be “spectacularly short-sighted to pull funding from programmes designed to support teachers and schools to deliver better maths provision”.\n\n“Our maths education is not up to scratch — too many young people are leaving school without the skills they need for life or the well-paid jobs that will drive economic growth,” he said.\n\nDan Abramson, chief executive of U-Maths, the umbrella organisation for university maths schools in England and professor of mathematics education at King’s College London, said cutting the scheme risked halting two decades of progress on the take-up of maths.\n\n“For the UK to be at the forefront of AI and the data-driven modern economy, we need excellent mathematicians from all backgrounds, and we need more of them — that means more investment, not less,” he said.\n\nThe maths scheme, which had a budget of £17mn for the period July 2022-24, was part of a programme under the previous Conservative government to boost the take up of maths in schools.\n\nThe scheme, which is delivered by the charity Mathematics Education Innovation, provided assistance to schools to teach advanced maths, including online teaching support, training teachers and help for students to prepare for university entrance exams.\n\nIt was a successor programme to the Further Mathematics Support Programme established by Labour in 2009 to increase A-level maths participation. Both programmes are widely credited with a significant increase in the number of students taking A-level maths.\n\nEntries for maths A-level in England have risen from 64,500 in 2009 to more than 98,000 in 2024, while the number of students taking further maths increased from 9,400 to almost 17,000 over the same period.\n\nThe AMSP also drove an uptake in the core maths programme, which is offered alongside A-levels\n\nSince 2018, the number of students in England awarded certifications in core maths, a level 3 qualification for students who have chosen not to study A-level maths, has almost doubled from 6,600 to 12,500.\n\nThe Department for Education confirmed it was making the cuts, but said it was looking for alternatives. “We are looking at all options, including other sources of funding, to make sure that the most important parts of this programme can continue,” a spokesperson added.",

    "blurb": "I’m worried that being married to the owner will affect my eligibility to invest via SEIS",
    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "My partner and I got engaged over Christmas and we’re excited to begin thinking about setting a date for the wedding. My wife-to-be is an entrepreneur and last year I invested in one of her small businesses through the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), to help the business grow and for the tax advantages the scheme offers. I plan to make further such investments over the coming years. However, will being married to the owner affect my eligibility to invest via SEIS? Are there any alternative venture capital schemes I could use which offer tax relief?\n\nGuy Wilmot, partner in the corporate and commercial team at law firm Russell-Cooke, says rules around SEIS are notoriously complicated, so it is right to think about this in advance. Unfortunately, it is likely that when you are married the previous relief will be disapplied and you will not be able to make further SEIS (or EIS) investments in your fiancée’s company.\n\nSEIS relief is not available if an investor is “connected” to the company they invest in. An investor will be treated as being connected if they, together with their associates, hold more than 30 per cent of the company’s shares or voting rights.\n\nAn associate under these rules includes a spouse, parents and grandparents, children and grandchildren. As such, for the purposes of SEIS and EIS, a married couple are treated as a single unit. If that married unit holds more than 30 per cent of the company’s shares, the relief is not available. It is worth bearing in mind that extended family members, such as aunts, uncles and even brothers and sisters, may still be eligible to invest under EIS or SEIS.\n\nEven if the shareholdings were below the threshold, it is still highly likely that the relief would not apply because employees of a company (and their associates) are also connected with that company.\n\nThe test of whether an investor is connected to a company applies for three years after the investment is made. If the test is breached within that period, then the previous relief may be withdrawn. As your investment was made last year, a delay in the marriage of potentially more than two years might be needed to avoid withdrawal of the relief, which perhaps takes tax planning to an extreme level, but is of course a personal choice.\n\nAs you plan your future with your fiancée, one option could be to consider becoming a part owner of the business. Gifts of shares between spouses do not attract CGT and there may be suitable strategies you could consider for supporting the growth of what will soon be a family business, including use of capital allowances.\n\nNeedless to say, couples considering merging business and financial interests on marriage will probably wish to take appropriate family law advice, potentially including putting in place a suitable pre- or postnuptial agreement.\n\nIt’s natural and common for entrepreneurs to turn to friends and family when getting their business ventures off the ground. But entering into a marriage does change the nature of the relationship, not only with the entrepreneur, but also with the business.\n\nI am 75, living with my wife. We have two daughters, the younger one living and working in London. She is hoping to buy a flat and we are trying to downsize to help her fund the purchase. I am aware of the seven-year inheritance tax (IHT) rule.\n\nHowever, to reduce IHT on the estate (of less than £1mn) we are also considering putting the house into trust for the two girls. If we did that, would that make the London daughter part-owner of the house and prevent her from gaining first-time buyer privileges?\n\nHarry Cousens, an associate in the private client and tax team at Withersworldwide, says that with regard to your inheritance tax exposure, you should be aware that everyone has a “nil rate band” of £325,000 to set against the value of their estate. Also, where a residence or interest in it is inherited by children, an additional nil rate band (the “residence nil rate band”) of £175,000 is available, in certain circumstances, where the individual downsizes and assets of an equivalent value were left on death to direct descendants. This means that on your death, it may be possible for your daughters to inherit your estate IHT-free (on the basis that your estate is still worth £1mn or less).\n\nNevertheless, it is understandable that you may wish to make a lifetime gift to your daughter to help her on to the property ladder. For inheritance tax purposes, a gift to your daughter will be classed as a potentially exempt transfer (Pet).\n\nPets can become taxable at a maximum of 40 per cent if you die within seven years of the gift, with a tapering scale if you survive the gift by more than three years. You and your wife should consider which of you (or both) should make the Pet in light of this.\n\nHowever, if you were to die within seven years of the gift, as outlined above, you should have your nil rate band of £325,000 to set against the value of the gift and the residence nil rate band may provide further relief. In addition, there is the ‘annual small gift exemption’ of £3,000.\n\nIf you sell your property, this will count as a disposal for capital gains tax, but provided the property is your only home that you have lived in throughout your period of ownership, principal private residence relief would apply and no capital gains tax would be payable.\n\nTurning to the question of a trust, whether settling your home will create a stamp duty issue for your daughters depends on the trust’s terms. If the girls have a right to occupy the property and/or receive any rental income, then this would jeopardise the availability of first-time buyers’ relief and it would also result in the additional property surcharge (now 5 per cent, following the Autumn Budget) applying to the purchase of a property by your daughters.\n\nHowever, settling your property on trust is unlikely to be a good idea for other reasons. First, to the extent the property is valued higher than £650,000 (assuming both you and your wife have your full nil rate bands available), an immediate 20 per cent inheritance tax charge would apply to the creation of the trust. Second, if you continue to occupy the property you have given away, anti-avoidance provisions would apply, and the property would be treated as remaining in your estate for inheritance tax purposes.\n\nUnder current rules, with a joint estate worth less than £1mn, your daughters are unlikely to have any further inheritance tax to pay if you survive the Pet of the excess sale proceeds by seven years. The opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.

    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government will inject £20mn into lossmaking Anglo-Danish rocket maker Orbex, via a loan aimed at funding the company’s small launcher through to lift-off in Scotland this year.\n\nThe company said the government would “become a shareholder” as part of its latest £40mn fundraising round. However, the investment is being made via a convertible loan note.\n\nNeither the government nor Orbex would give details of the conditions that could result in the loan converting to equity, which would leave the state owning a share of the company.\n\nOrbex is one of two British rocket companies that has been supported by the UK government in recent years as part of its strategy to develop launch capabilities in Britain. Its decision to inject £20mn comes amid a tough fundraising environment for space tech.\n\nIn October the government hired accountancy firm PwC to investigate Orbex’s financial health and to verify that “all levers including third party financing options, will be, or have been exhausted and addressed prior to evaluation of HMG intervention options”, according to a contract notice published online.\n\nPwC declined to comment.\n\nThe UK’s support to Orbex is happening as start-ups across Europe prepare to enter the European Launcher Challenge to develop a medium- lift rocket capable of competing with Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Blue Origin, owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos.\n\nLast December Orbex suspended plans to develop a spaceport at Sutherland in the Scottish Highlands to focus resources on developing the Prime microlauncher, designed to launch small payloads into low Earth orbit, and a bigger rocket, Proxima, which could be a contender for the European Launcher Challenge.\n\nScience and technology secretary Peter Kyle said the investment signalled the UK’s determination to be “a key part of the new space revolution in Europe”.\n\nPhil Chambers, Orbex chief executive, said the UK support would be “a strong signal to other private investors, and to the European Space Agency and the EU that we’re serious about being a part of the future of European launch”.\n\nHowever, a government stake in Orbex could prove controversial after the state’s failed investment in satellite start-up OneWeb.\n\nHaving paid $500mn to buy the satellite company out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020, the UK announced plans two years later to sell its stake to French satellite group Eutelsat in return for a 11 per cent holding in the enlarged group. Eutelsat shares have lost three quarters of their value since the deal was announced.\n\nThe UK’s government’s injection of funds into Orbex represents half the £40mn the company had been hoping for in a fundraising launched last year.\n\nIn total Orbex has raised £23mn in the series D round, including investments from the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark, Octopus Ventures and private investor Sohaib Abbas.\n\nChambers said having the UK government as “part of the consortium will really bolster” the final fundraising efforts.\n\nThe UK’s support for Orbex will be welcomed by the UK space industry, which has criticised successive governments for a failure to develop a clear space strategy.\n\nIan Annett, former deputy chief executive of the UK Space Agency and now an independent consultant in the industry, said he supported the investment. “It is a clear signal of the intention to support a competitive launch industry within Europe,” he said. “Having assured access to space, whether for security, economic prosperity or science, will be an important asset for the UK.”\n\nIn 2023, the latest year for which accounts are available, Orbex reported pre-tax losses more than doubled to £17.2mn. The company has raised a total of £129mn in public and private funding since it was founded in 2015.",

    "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will promise to go “further and faster” to kick-start the UK economy in a major speech on Wednesday, as she tries to convince business that the government is committed to driving growth.\n\nReeves will signal she is prepared to have a “fight” with opponents — including environmentalists — who stand in the way of the government’s planning reforms.\n\nThe chancellor is under pressure to reassure companies and investors after her tax-raising Budget in October, the government’s package of employment reforms, and a rise in gilt yields amid fears about stagflation.\n\nReeves will confirm that the government is reviving plans for an “Oxford-Cambridge growth corridor” as part of a broader push to liberalise the planning regime and ensure more homes are built.\n\nThe chancellor will also emphasise progress on an industrial strategy and signal her support for airport expansion in Greater London.\n\n“For too long we have accepted low expectations, accepted stagnation,” Reeves will say in her speech. “Low growth is not our destiny. But growth will not come without a fight.”\n\nIn an article for The Times, Sir Keir Starmer likened his government to Margaret Thatcher’s as he promised deregulation to boost growth.\n\nThe prime minister complained about a “morass of regulation that effectively bans billions of pounds more of investment from flowing into Britain”, adding that the government will “kick down the barriers to building, clear out the regulatory weeds and allow a new era of British growth to bloom”.\n\nThe UK economy expanded by 0.1 per cent in November, following 0.1 per cent contractions in both October and September, according to official data.\n\nThe Oxford-Cambridge arc would involve new transport links and housing between Britain’s two foremost university cities. It was shelved three years ago by then-Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson.\n\nReeves will highlight plans for a 4,500-home development around Cambridge and praise Cambridge university’s proposal to build an innovation hub.\n\nThe chancellor has stepped up her pro-growth rhetoric in recent months, ordering Whitehall departments and regulators to prioritise policies that will deliver economic benefits.\n\nOn Tuesday Starmer promised to “hardwire growth into all decisions in the cabinet” during a meeting with Reeves and senior executives in the City of London.\n\nDowning Street confirmed a change to the Whitehall “write round” process, under which cabinet members are consulted on new policies, meaning ministers will have to set out new policies’ “growth credentials”.\n\nIn March, the government will unveil a planning and infrastructure bill to block protesters from using multiple judicial reviews, and to erode the power of environmental quangos to delay big housebuilding schemes.\n\nThe proposed legislation, along with Reeves’ enthusiasm for a third runway at Heathrow airport, has prompted jitters among some green groups.\n\nShaun Spiers, executive director of the Green Alliance, said Reeves’ speech looked set to “take a wrecking ball” to relations between the government and the environmental movement.\n\n“Far from building the partnership needed to deliver the genuine programme of economic and social renewal at the heart of the clean power and growth missions, the government seems intent on torching a core part of its political coalition in pursuit of a series of high-risk, high-carbon, but ultimately, low-return projects,” he added.\n\nTransport secretary Heidi Alexander is expected to approve expansions at both Luton and Gatwick airports before the spring in a quasi-judicial process.\n\nHeathrow is still waiting for clear political support before it submits its application — potentially before the end of the year — to proceed with the third runway.\n\nExpanding Heathrow was previously opposed by eight current cabinet members including Starmer himself.\n\nClimate change secretary Ed Miliband is a long-standing opponent, but has indicated he would not resign from the cabinet.\n\nBut several backbench Labour MPs with west London constituencies criticised the potential expansion in the House of Commons on Tuesday.\n\nA report published on Wednesday by the Good Growth Foundation, a new think-tank run by Praful Nargund , former Labour candidate for Islington North, will warn that lifting GDP will not be enough to keep voters happy.\n\n“The cost of living is voters’ primary focus . . . success looks like ending the crisis and increasing disposable income,” the report will say. “The public must see the economy growing in a way that benefits them.”",

    "body": "UK defence secretary John Healey has told universities to ensure the safety of defence companies attending careers fairs amid rising industry fears over harassment from protesters.\n\nHealey said companies were facing “harassment and intimidation”, with many forced to cancel events on campus.\n\n“This is wrong. This attitude takes for granted the privileged position we enjoy in Britain — to live in freedom and security . . . security our defence industry guarantees,” he told an industry audience on Tuesday evening.\n\nHealey said that, together with business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and education secretary Bridget Phillipson, he had written to Universities UK, the main sector lobby group, to demand assurances for companies’ safety.\n\nThe move comes after it emerged that several defence groups had been forced to withdraw from careers fairs in recent months after being advised to cancel over security concerns.\n\nThe scale of the protests had affected companies’ recruitment plans by putting potential recruits off a career in defence, said one industry executive. The situation risked exacerbating an industry-wide skills shortage, they added.\n\nBritain’s aerospace and defence sector directly employs 164,000 people with an average salary of £39,900 — 14 per cent higher than the UK average.\n\nWhile the war in Ukraine and suspected Russian and Chinese sabotage of deep sea cables in Europe have underlined the importance of defence resilience, industry executives believe the sector continues to lack wider support.\n\nAnti-war protesters have stepped up their activities against the sector in recent months, notably in the wake of the Israel-Gaza conflict. Sites owned by BAE Systems and the UK arm of Italy’s Leonardo came under attack several times last year.\n\nDefence companies were being ranked alongside tobacco and gambling in environmental, social and governance audits, said Healey, adding that pension funds were also divesting from the sector. While he had no doubt the intentions were “well meaning . . . they are fundamentally flawed”, he said.\n\n“We don’t stop wars by boycotting our defence industry. We stop wars by backing it,” said Healey, adding that national security was a precondition for “economic security, investor confidence and social stability”.\n\nUniversities UK said it had recently convened vice-chancellors as well as university security staff to discuss “how best to ensure those students who wish [to] consider careers in the defence sector have the chance to do so, safely”.\n\nUniversities, it added, had a “vital role to play enabling all the key industries in the industrial strategy, including defence, to succeed, whether through the skilled graduates they teach or the research and innovation they pioneer”.",

The president recently praised Sir Keir Starmer, saying the UK prime minister had done a “very good job so far”.\n\nThe diplomatic process has been expedited to allow Mandelson to get started swiftly at the beginning of the new Trump administration, overriding the usual timeframe for approvals.\n\nA recent precedent went in the other direction; the UK government sped up its approval of Jane Hartley — Joe Biden’s pick for US ambassador to the UK — in the summer of 2022 in order to allow her to attend the late Queen Elizabeth’s platinum jubilee festivities.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Downing Street declined to comment.\n\nStarmer’s choice of Mandelson as ambassador has not been uncontroversial in Trump’s circle and the wider Republican party, in part because of his past business links to China.\n\nChris LaCivita, a senior campaign adviser to Trump, called the former cabinet minister an “absolute moron” last month, questioning why the UK government was installing him to replace a “professional universally respected ambo”, a reference to the outgoing UK representative Dame Karen Pierce.\n\nShe has been touted as a “Trump whisperer” for the close bridges she built with his team, which helped facilitate a phone call between the president and Starmer last July following an assassination attempt on Trump, as well as a trip by then-UK foreign secretary Lord David Cameron to Mar-a-Lago last April.\n\nMandelson will still hold shares in the lobbying firm he co-founded as he takes up his new post as the UK’s ambassador in Washington, despite the company’s work for Chinese clients such as TikTok, the Financial Times revealed earlier this month.\n\nHe is expected to sell his stake in Global Counsel over time but has not set a deadline for fully divesting.\n\nSeveral US senators unhappy about Mandelson’s appointment on Tuesday handed a document to the FBI detailing his connections with China, according to Australian news website The Nightly.\n\nThe document, seen by the FT, was a compilation of open source information pulled from the Chinese internet and was drawn up by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a cross-party group of global lawmakers concerned about Beijing.\n\nMandelson will have an important role in trying to protect the UK from US tariffs, as well as handle potentially contentious issues such as the proposed deal on the future of the Chagos Islands, which are home to a crucial joint UK-US military base.\n\nIn their first phone call on Monday night, UK foreign secretary David Lammy and US secretary of state Marco Rubio discussed the proposed deal between Britain and Mauritius about the Indian Ocean archipelago, despite the subject not appearing in official readouts from the UK foreign office or US state department, said people familiar with the conversation.\n\nWhile Rubio has been critical of the deal in the past, the UK and the US governments have both stressed the importance of protecting the military base on Diego Garcia in the long term.",

    "blurb": "CMA decision comes as the US tech giant and Amazon face potential probes into their dominance of the market",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK antitrust regulator has singled out Microsoft for using its dominance in software to stifle rivals in the £9bn UK cloud services market, as the watchdog warned competition “is not working”.\n\nAn independent panel acting for the Competition and Markets Authority said on Tuesday that a lack of competition in cloud services was “likely to be leading to higher costs, less choice, less innovation and lower quality of service for businesses and organisations”.\n\n“Microsoft is using its strong position in software to make it harder for Amazon Web Services and Google to compete effectively for cloud customers that wish to use Microsoft software on the cloud,” the panel said in its provisional decision.\n\nIt also recommended the CMA use its new powers under the digital markets regime to decide whether Amazon and Microsoft should receive “strategic market status” as a result of their influence in the area.\n\nUnder new legislation, which came into force this month, the UK regulator can designate a small group of companies as having such status and impose certain conduct requirements to try to increase competition.\n\nThe decision comes as the CMA is under intense pressure from the government to show it is promoting growth, as Labour attempts to increase business investment in the UK. In an unexpected move last week, CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink was ousted by business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and replaced with former Amazon UK head Doug Gurr.\n\nWriting in the Financial Times on Tuesday, Gurr said the agency would look to speed up its investigations to try to unlock greater investment in the country and bring in greater sector expertise so that businesses did not have to waste time educating the regulator about the industry.\n\nThe cloud services investigation has been continuing in various forms for more than two years. Ofcom opened a market study in October 2022 and published an interim report before referring it to the CMA a year later.\n\nThe CMA inquiry group said a general lack of competition was interfering with customers’ ability “to switch cloud provider or use multiple clouds, which may ultimately impact the price and quality of cloud services”.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft are the two largest providers of cloud services, each with a share of up to 40 per cent of UK customer spend, followed by Google.\n\nRima Alaily, Microsoft’s deputy general counsel and head of its competition law group, said in a statement that the report “should be focused on paving the way for the UK’s AI-powered future, not fixating on legacy products launched in the last century”.\n\n“The cloud computing market has never been so dynamic and competitive, attracting billions in investments, new entrants and rapid innovation. What could be better for UK businesses and government?” added Alaily.\n\nAmazon Web Services said the CMA’s proposed intervention was “not warranted” and urged the agency to “carefully consider how regulatory intervention in other areas will stifle innovation and ultimately harm customers in the UK”.\n\n“The evidence demonstrates the IT services industry is highly competitive,” AWS said. “Cloud computing has lowered costs for UK businesses with on-demand services and pay-as-you-go pricing, expanded product choice, and increased competition and innovation.”\n\nChris Lindsay, Google Cloud’s vice-president for customer engineering in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: “Restrictive licensing harms UK cloud customers, threatens economic progress and stifles innovation, and we are encouraged that the CMA has recognised the harm of these practices.”\n\nThe CMA must publish a final decision by August 4.",

    "body": "A pioneer of the listed law firm model in the UK has suspended trading in its shares and said it was unlikely to find the funding required to secure its future, following long-running disputes among its management.\n\nRBG Holdings, which owns the law firms Rosenblatt and Memery Crystal, said on Tuesday that it had suspended trading on London’s Aim market after a “lack of progress regarding the various strategic options explored” to find the required funding.\n\nRBG was among the first law firm groups in the UK to go public after the Legal Services Act opened the sector in 2011 and allowed law firms — traditionally structured as partnerships — to accept outside investment or float on the stock market. Midlands firm Gateley became the first to list in 2015, with RBG following suit in 2018.\n\nThe announcement signals an end to a turbulent period at the law firm group, whose shares have plummeted amid sinking revenues and management bust-ups. Rosenblatt founder Ian Rosenblatt attempted to oust RBG’s chief executive and two non-executive directors shortly before Christmas.\n\nThe group said this month that it had terminated Rosenblatt’s consultancy agreement with the firm because of alleged breaches and “offensive behaviour unbecoming of a solicitor and consultant to RBG”, which related to its understanding of Rosenblatt’s acquisition of another firm. However, RBG put out a statement days later correcting that understanding, and entered into a new agreement with Rosenblatt.\n\nRosenblatt did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen the Legal Services Act came into force more than a decade ago it was dubbed the legal sector’s “Big Bang” and expected to overhaul the traditional law firm model that had been in place for centuries. However, there has been limited take-up, and some firms have subsequently delisted.\n\nDWF, which was also among the first firms to go public, was taken private at the end of 2023 by private equity firm Inflexion. While there has been a lack of appetite for listings, private equity groups have been taking advantage of the fact law firms can now take external investments with a string of bets on the legal industry in recent years.\n\nThe developments come as KPMG is now attempting to prise open the US legal market to alternative business models, using an Arizona programme that allows non-lawyers to own law practices.",

    "blurb": "Projections include a rise in long-term migration and falling birth rates",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK’s population will rise by about 5mn to 72.5mn in the decade to 2032, according to new data, driven by more international migration than previously projected.\n\nOver the 10 years to mid-2032, the population is projected to rise by 4.9mn, or 7.3 per cent, from an estimated 67.6mn to 72.5mn, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.\n\nThe increase is projected to come entirely from net migration, while the natural change — the difference between births and deaths — is projected to be about zero.\n\nThe ONS said it now believed long-term international migration would be greater than in previous projections. Its latest forecasts also assume lower fertility and an increase in life expectancy.\n\nThe number of working-age people is projected to increase by 4.1mn, or 9.4 per cent, from 43.2mn to 47.3mn, over the same period.\n\nAdam Corlett, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “A larger working-age population means a bigger economy, more workers and higher tax receipts, which should deliver a fiscal boost of around £5bn a year by the end of the decade. If the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] uses these population projections, this will be welcome news for the chancellor given the wider economic pressures she is facing.”\n\nJames Robards of the ONS said the projections were “based on current and past trends, and aren’t forecasts about what may or may not happen in the future”.\n\nHe said the latest projections also highlighted an increasingly ageing population, with the number of people aged over 85 projected to nearly double to 3.3mn by 2047. “This is in part because of the ageing of the baby boom generation, as well as general increases in life expectancy,” Robards said.\n\nThe ONS clarifies that national population projections are not forecasts and do not directly account for recent and future policy or economic changes. They are based on an assumption of long-term net international migration of 340,000 people a year from mid-2028 onwards, up from previous projections of 315,000.\n\nJonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, said: “These projections are almost certainly overstated since they do not appear to take account of the sharp fall in net migration that is already under way, as we know from the separate statistics on visas issued.”\n\nONS figures published last November showed net migration to the UK exceeded 900,000 in the year to June 2023, the highest annual total on record, but fell by 20 per cent in the 12 months to June 2024.\n\nPortes added that the ONS figures published on Tuesday assumed that fertility would stabilise “whereas in recent years it has been falling significantly”. The ONS now assumes a long-term fertility rate of 1.45, down from 1.59 in the previous projections.\n\nThe latest figures showed that the fertility rate in England and Wales fell to 1.44 children per woman in 2023, the lowest since comparable data began in 1938.\n\nThe number of children aged under 15 years is projected to decrease by 797,000, from 12.4mn to 11.6mn, by mid-2032, according to the ONS.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of people of pensionable age is projected to increase by 1.7mn over the same period, or 14 per cent, from 12.0mn to 13.7mn, taking into account the planned increases in state pension age to 67 years for both sexes.\n\nThe UK’s projected population growth contrasts with the population already shrinking in many countries, including Italy, Japan, and China. The German population is also expected to start shrinking in the next few years, according to UN population forecasts.\n\nIn the outlook to 2047, the ONS said that “net migration is projected to be the only source of population growth in the UK over the next 25 years”.",

    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Running trains between Oxford and Cambridge to create a bigger research and development hub — as per plans revived by the UK government — is one way to foster economic growth. Easing the path for universities to spin out their innovations into business opportunities would be even smarter.\n\nTrue, the UK beats its European peers when it comes to commercialising research birthed in university labs. The country’s universities have spawned more than 2,000 spinouts since 2011, according to the Royal Academy of Engineering. Stars include Carbon Re, an industrial artificial intelligence company, spun out of Cambridge and University College London.\n\nBut the path from ivory towers to commercialisation is fraught. Last year’s equity investment of £2.6bn, according to the Royal Academy of Engineering, ended a two-year decline but is still below the 2021 peak. That’s about a 10th of the equity raised in the UK capital markets.\n\nClearer ground rules would help. Universities, founders and investors clash frequently. All would agree that value resides in intellectual property, but where the IP itself resides is a knottier issue. At Cambridge, the university gets first dibs. Compare that with Sweden’s Uppsala University, which usually confers ownership on the originator. One case, involving the University of Oxford, wound up in court.\n\nThat is just one hurdle. Extricating spinouts can be laborious; academia moves slowly. As the UK government’s 2023 review noted, panels are composed of committees that only meet irregularly and lack commercial experts. The average spinout took 10-12 months; for 16 per cent it was more than 16 months.\n\nUniversities are reluctant to cede much of their innovations: one in four spinouts began negotiations demanding a 50 per cent equity stake. Investors balk at being accorded just crumbs. This is improving — the average university equity stake at spinout fell to 18 per cent in 2023, from 25 per cent a decade ago — but there is scope for further loosening of the reins.\n\nAttracting and retaining human capital is a priority, and the UK is not alone in finding this challenging. Even the US, start-up central, is seeing STEM brains return to China; blockchain researcher Chen Jing is just the latest to forsake the US for Beijing’s Tsinghua University.\n\nStructural challenges remain for the UK. Many universities are broke; nearly all lack the generous endowments that buoy the coffers of US institutions. There are limits to the amount of money that can be poured into the type of research projects that could be spun out.\n\nBut innovation is flourishing in the country’s seats of learning, as is the government will to overcome constraints. Add in the trains and the UK just might have found a recipe for growth.\n\nlouise.lucas@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nThriv­ing uni­versity spin­outs must not be an Oxbridge pre­serve / From Professor Nick Jennings, Vice-Chancellor & President, Loughborough University",

    "blurb": "DeepSeek’s lower costs bode well for Keir Starmer, but government needs to be more open about its use of AI ",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Good morning. DeepSeek, a small Chinese artificial intelligence lab, has stunned the world and sent US tech stocks tumbling after unveiling its new R1 reasoning model. Its cheaper cost than rivals has called into question the business model of some of the big early players in AI.\n\nBut those lower overheads are good news for governments — including that of Keir Starmer — hoping that AI will allow them to trim the costs of public administration. If there is “no moat” in AI then governments stand to save money on paying for staff without having to lose the same money to high costs for one company’s large language model or another.\n\nMinisters in the previous government of Rishi Sunak and that of Starmer rave about some private companies and the products they make. But Sunak recognised, rightly, that government needed to build its own sovereign capacity in AI, hence the thing likely to be his biggest positive legacy to the UK: the Incubator for Artificial Intelligence (i.AI). The AI unit in the Cabinet Office was launched in November 2023 in the hopes of expediting how information was compiled from different departments and allowing officials to make faster decisions. DeepSeek’s success is a positive indicator for the UK and for all governments that want to do the same.\n\nIn addition to costs, the development in AI will also involve some big cultural changes in government. Some thoughts on one of them in today’s note.\n\nLast week, the government unveiled a series of new tools that, it says, will make government run faster for less. Consult is designed to use AI to reduce the cost of running consultations with stakeholders by cutting the time allocated to a civil service task that ordinarily requires hours and hours. Ministers launch about 700-800 consultations a year. Parlex and Lex (no, not that Lex) both support in researching legislation but also model how MPs might react to a policy issue.\n\nAll of these and more are designed to do the same thing: reduce the amount of time the civil service spends on administrative tasks that do not require a human brain and reduce the amount of policy work that gets done on projects that will never be signed off by a special adviser or a minister.\n\nAlthough such technology is new, the spin is very, very old in that these are all the fruits of things that Sunak established as prime minister. Taking advantage of the good things your predecessor did is a long-standing political trick. The tools are also pretty much all in either alpha (ie “we aren’t sure if this works”) or beta stage (ie “we don’t know how much help it actually is now we’ve got it to work”).\n\nPart of seizing the benefits of AI and digital government more broadly is transparency about what you’re doing, why you’re doing it and what is working and isn’t. And one of the unalloyed positives about digital government in the UK has been the capacity to not only publish data on the outcomes of government efforts but also to show its working.\n\nA good thing about i.AI is that it has had a long history of failures: if you are not failing most of the time you either a) aren’t really innovating or b) aren’t being transparent about what you are doing or, worst of all c) you are releasing a lot of projects for public use that don’t work to save face.\n\nThere’s an inevitable tension here that goes right to the heart of why governments are less nimble than private companies. As a taxpayer I want both national and local government to innovate, experiment, and be prepared to get things wrong to deliver better public services. As someone who uses public services, I want those services to work first time.\n\nAnd governments of all stripes are incentivised not to fail publicly, even at development stage. As a result, government programmes are often “doomed to succeed”: something that is announced, whether as an old-fashioned pilot programme or a newfangled beta test, is incentivised to progress to a proper rollout. That’s because governments are beaten up for failing.\n\nThe negative headlines arising from the government’s difficulties in getting AI models that actually work in the Department for Work and Pensions are a case in point (as reported by Robert Booth over at the Guardian). My concern here isn’t that the government has had many unsuccessful pilots: that is a good thing, and part of government seizing the benefits of AI is going to be trying things at pilot stage that don’t work. My worry is that the story emerged through a freedom of information request. Government needs to shake off its old, old addiction to failing in secrecy if it is going to get the benefits both of sharing knowledge about how AI works with households and businesses, and for us to trust how governments use AI.\n\nThis week, I mostly listened to Emma Rawicz’s Chroma while writing my column.",

    "blurb": "Changes will require UK ministers to prove economic impact of policies before approval",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer has promised to “hard wire growth into all decisions in the cabinet”, as he set out what he called a new approach to policymaking at a meeting with senior executives in the City of London.\n\nDowning Street said that in future all cabinet ministers would have to “set out the growth credentials of new policies in order to get approval from their cabinet colleagues”.\n\nThe “growth impact of proposals will be subject to the same rigorous assessment that already applies to new public spending”, No 10 added.\n\nStarmer’s change to the Whitehall “write round” process for cabinet decisions — in which cabinet ministers are consulted on new policies — is intended to focus attention on the growth potential of new policies.\n\n“Everything has to be seen through the question of whether it is pro-growth,” Starmer told business executives on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe message came as chancellor Rachel Reeves prepared to give a speech on growth on Wednesday in which she will signal support for a third runway at Heathrow airport, a policy previously opposed by senior cabinet members, as well as the prime minister himself.\n\nStarmer and Reeves on Tuesday met executives in the City of London, where both adopted a notably bullish tone on the prospects for the British economy, in stark contrast to their gloomy rhetoric last year.\n\nBusiness leaders had warned that Reeves’ insistence that she had been handed by the Conservatives “the worst economic inheritance” of any UK government since the second world war had sucked confidence out of the economy.\n\nThey have also criticised the Labour government for introducing measures that executives say will hit growth, including a £25bn national insurance increase on employers and new labour laws.\n\nAt a round-table breakfast, Reeves adopted a markedly more bullish tone than last year. “It’s the role of government to shout about all the amazing things we are doing as a country,” she said.\n\n“We want to partner with you in business to showcase all the great things we have going for us,” she added.\n\nReeves will use her speech on Wednesday to promise to go “further and faster” on growth, including greenlighting airport expansion in the south-east, a move that has caused unrest in Labour circles.\n\nIn the last House of Commons vote on a third runway at Heathrow in 2018, seven members of the current cabinet voted against it, including Starmer. The others were Ed Miliband, Steve Reed, Lisa Nandy, Darren Jones, Anneliese Dodds and Hilary Benn.\n\nMiliband, climate change secretary, has previously strongly opposed Heathrow’s expansion, but has indicated he will not resign from the cabinet over the new policy.\n\nReeves told Labour MPs on Monday evening to back the government’s growth agenda, in spite of nervousness on the left of the party that she was neglecting consumer interests and getting too close to big business.\n\nMeanwhile, the chancellor will also promise on Wednesday to simplify the planning system and confirm plans to relax rules over the release of some of the £160bn surplus in defined benefit pension schemes.\n\nCorporate leaders at the City meeting included Charlie Nunn of Lloyds Banking Group, Marco Amitrano of PwC, Jennie Daly of Taylor Wimpey and Paul Golding of Pinewood.\n\nLast week, a PwC survey of chief executives conducted in October and early November — mostly before Labour’s tax-raising October 30 Budget — found that Britain was the second most attractive country for investment behind the US.\n\nGolding told reporters that his film production company would be able to ride out recent government increases in national insurance contributions and new employment laws, but urged Reeves not to increase business rates.\n\n“Don’t tinker — steady as she goes,” he said. “The last thing we want is to see business rates deter investment into the industry.”",

    "blurb": "The Axel Rudakubana case shows the importance of the government looking beyond ideology ",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Why do we seek to understand what drives acts of extreme violence? One answer is that these acts shake our sense of what it means to be human. That Axel Rudakubana could murder three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport last year, or that Salman Abedi could blow himself up at a Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in 2017, killing 22 people, many of them children, is incomprehensible to most of us. That someone could set out one day with the intent to murder and kill isn’t something we can get our heads around.\n\nAbedi’s horrific crimes are no easier to justify but they are, I think, easier to categorise and explain. Abedi was a jihadist extremist who believed that his murders would advance his cause. He was a man who convinced himself that his ends justified his violent and heinous means. Rudakubana is harder to understand: for him, his violent means were his ends. The Southport murders are shocking in part because we can’t categorise them.\n\nRudakubana confounds us because he is beyond our imagination. I think we can all imagine what it would be to be a fanatic. We all believe in something and we can at least conceive of, if not fully understand, what it means to be willing to kill the innocent in the service of an idea. We can imagine, too, what it might mean to lose our reason and to commit horrific crimes due to a psychotic break.\n\nThe idea of someone first convincing themselves of the rightness of their cause online and then turning to violent means to advance it does not lie beyond our comprehension. But we struggle to understand someone for whom viewing violent acts online is in itself a source of motivation — a person who could view the horrors of the world and decide that they wanted to add to them simply because of a fascination with violence.\n\nCategorising extreme violence is also how governments degrade, undermine and defeat those who wish to commit it. In the UK, where Islamist extremism makes up 75 per cent of the counterterror caseload in Great Britain (together with a growing threat from the extreme right), understanding the ideologies that drive or justify acts of extreme violence is part of how we stop them. Doing so helps us decide when events might require extra security, or which individuals might need enhanced monitoring. It tells us where they might attack, and it helps our security services infiltrate and undermine organised terrorism.\n\nThat is part of how MI5 and the police have managed to foil 43 “late stage” terror plots since 2017. It is also how Prevent, another strand in the UK’s counterterrorism strategy, has diverted many more away from the cause of terrorism.\n\nBut it is much harder to work out how to tackle and stop someone like Rudakubana who commits violent acts seemingly for violence’s sake. His motivations are still further from our own than those of someone who commits horrific acts for an ideological reason.\n\nSo some — not least the UK prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer — think that the way to deal with what Christopher Wray, former director of the FBI, dubbed “salad bar extremism”, a pick and mix of incomprehensible rationales and ideological justifications for extreme violence, is to change the state’s definition of terrorism. How a state, particularly a liberal democracy, defines terrorism matters because states sometimes use that definition to suspend some or all of the safeguards that define liberal democracies in the first place. But as Jonathan Hall, the UK’s independent reviewer, has argued persuasively in these pages, one effect of expanding the definition of terrorism would be to significantly increase the number of areas in which we reduce and curtail the rights of individuals.\n\nWhat really matters is not how the British state has categorised Islamist extremism and the extreme right, but its understanding of what drives them — what their centres of power are and how to undermine them. Such an understanding is what has allowed the security services to defeat extreme animal rights activists, whose activities used to blight and terrorise scientific researchers.\n\nTo defeat violence for violence’s sake, we need to understand what drives it in the way that we have at least begun to understand ideologically and religiously-driven acts of extreme violence. As strange and alien as extreme violence seems to us, we have to find a way to make it comprehensible if we are to protect ourselves from it. Although it will always remain hard for us to understand the acts of extremists, it is only through deeper understanding that we will be able to find greater security.\n\nstephen.bush@ft.com",

    "body": "The UK’s competition regulator will speed up its investigations in order to try to unlock greater investment into the country, the newly installed chair of the regulator has said.\n\nWriting in the Financial Times, Doug Gurr said the agency would make its merger and market investigations “as simple and rapid as possible”.\n\nThe CMA will also bring in greater sector expertise so that businesses do not have to waste time educating the regulator about their industry.\n\n“We know it costs businesses when they have to deal with lengthy and uncertain investigations,” he said. “Good decisions, clear decisions, rapid decisions — that’s what you tell us you need and that’s on us to deliver.”\n\nGurr, the former head of Amazon UK, was named as the Competition and Markets Authority’s interim chair last week, after former chair Marcus Bokkerink was ousted by ministers.\n\nHe wrote that “a regulatory environment that encourages the greatest possible level of business investment” would be the agency’s new “north star”, while also stressing the need to protect consumers.\n\nGurr ran Amazon’s British operations during the tech group’s tussle with the CMA over its minority investment in Deliveroo and is expected to take a more friendly approach towards business.\n\nThe CMA was previously criticised for being too interventionist, with its delay in approving Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision seen as damaging the UK’s standing internationally.\n\n“Last year, the UK again delivered the lowest level of business investment in the G7. This has been true for far too long,” wrote Gurr. “We want both domestic and international businesses to see the UK as a great place to invest.”\n\nHe added: “This means giving start-ups and venture backers the confidence to launch their businesses here, not elsewhere in the world. It means encouraging multinationals — who have a pretty much free choice to place their investments anywhere in the [Europe, Middle East and Africa] timezone — to choose the UK.”\n\nGurr was called by the government about the role shortly before Bokkerink was ousted last week. He has been appointed as interim chair for up to 18 months following the sudden departure.\n\nAs well as his CMA role, which is part time, he is the director of the Natural History Museum and chair of the Alan Turing Institute. In order to take up the CMA position he resigned from roles at UK Biobank, Genomics England and Permira.\n\nHe and CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell will on Tuesday host the CMA’s new “growth and investment council”, which features representative groups such as the CBI, to discuss the agency’s draft annual plan, which was published earlier this month before Bokkerink’s resignation.\n\nThe events of the past week have raised questions about whether the CMA’s draft annual plan, which already mentions ‘growth’ 111 times, will be overhauled to better align with the government’s objectives.\n\nA finalised plan is expected to be published in March after the agency has been given its “strategic steer”, a document setting out the government’s expectations for the regulator.\n\nThe CMA is also looking to cut 10 per cent of staff, which it blamed last week on a “budgeting issue”.",

    "blurb": "Prime minister becoming more ambitious for post-Brexit ‘reset’ talks ahead of key Brussels summit ",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer is looking to relink the UK and EU emission trading schemes in a sign of the prime minister becoming more ambitious over his “reset” of relations with Brussels ahead of a key meeting next week.\n\nOn February 3 Starmer will become the first British leader since Brexit to attend a meeting of the European Council’s 27 EU leaders, an informal gathering in Brussels devoted to defence and security co-operation.\n\nWith a planned EU-UK summit in the spring to discuss a wider review of post-Brexit relations, Starmer and his ministers are discussing new ways of building co-operation with Britain’s biggest trading partner.\n\nSince Brexit, when the EU and UK separated their carbon markets, UK permits have traded at a significant discount to those traded in the EU.\n\nRelinking the schemes would deepen the liquidity of both markets and help both sides with the transition to net zero, according to consultancy Frontier Economics.\n\nIt would also make it possible to avoid border frictions caused by the EU and UK imposing carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs), a tax on carbon-intensive imports such as steel, cement and fertiliser.\n\nTwo EU officials with knowledge of the discussion said the UK had requested that ETS linkage and CBAMs be included on the agenda for the spring summit, expected in March or April.\n\nLast week Nick Thomas-Symonds, Cabinet Office minister overseeing the reset discussions, said Britain would look to link to the EU’s emissions trading scheme to avoid disruption to UK business.\n\nHe told the House of Commons business and trade committee: “Linking our respective systems is absolutely what the ambition is.”\n\nMeanwhile, chancellor Rachel Reeves signalled on Sunday that Britain would consider joining an EU customs framework with neighbouring countries. She has also supported Britain aligning permanently with EU rules in established industries such as chemicals.\n\nShe said she was “absolutely happy” to look at the idea of Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention, a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries, including in the Middle East and Balkans.\n\nIt comes as EU diplomats warned that unless Starmer showed more ambition, his reset would do little to boost the UK economy. “None of this would have any impact on growth,” said one.\n\nLabour’s general election manifesto last year ruled out Britain rejoining the single market, customs union or adopting free movement, but Starmer and Reeves are now looking to show that the reset can yield economic gains.\n\nOne senior UK government official said: “British business wants to avoid any kind of cliff edge or extra costs. We are looking for win-win solutions to build confidence and relinking our carbon markets falls into that category.”\n\nThe UK government has been under mounting pressure from industry to announce it will align its ETS scheme with that of the EU in order to remove additional border bureaucracy. There are also growing concerns, for example in the steel industry, about the impact of a decision to introduce the UK’s CBAM in 2027 — a full year later than the EU tax.\n\nAdam Berman, director of policy at lobby group Energy UK, said relinking the UK and EU carbon markets was “the only solution that protects British industry from the incoming EU CBAM. Divergence for the sake of divergence won’t do anything to bring down energy bills or make British businesses more competitive — problems that ETS linkage can help to solve.”\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Under the terms of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the UK government and EU agreed to consider linking our respective carbon pricing schemes and to co-operate on carbon pricing.”\n\nBut the issue is likely to be the subject of a difficult negotiation. A leaked internal document setting out the EU’s negotiating positions last month said the majority of EU states were open to linkage, but on condition that the UK submitted to “full dynamic alignment” with EU law, which would require the UK to replicate relevant EU legislation on the UK statute book.\n\nDonald Trump’s administration has indicated it views carbon border taxes as discriminatory and that they could be subject to retaliation under plans the US president has ordered to be drawn up “within 60 days”.\n\nSir Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat leader, has urged Starmer to be more ambitious with his UK-EU reset, and wants Britain to rejoin the customs union.\n\n“It is clear they are ready to talk seriously, they are worried about Trump too,” he told the Financial Times. “This is the moment for Labour to take a risk, be ambitious and go for a deal that can actually jump-start the economy.”\n\nLabour’s manifesto set out limited ambitions for a reset, including a deal to facilitate trade in animal and plant products, the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and a deal to allow UK artists to tour freely across the EU.\n\nBrussels will demand a number of concessions from the UK in exchange for any deal, including continued access to British fishing waters. “There’s nothing without fish,” said one EU official.\n\nThe EU is also demanding a bilateral “youth experience scheme” to allow under-30s to be able to travel and work in the UK and the bloc. Starmer has promised not to reintroduce free movement, but British officials believe some kind of compromise may be possible.\n\nAndrew Griffith, Conservative shadow business secretary, said: “We must avoid undoing Brexit by the back door by aligning with the EU’s low growth model.”",

    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "The writer is interim chair of the Competition and Markets Authority\n\nThe UK government has set out economic growth as its top priority and has done so for good and sound reasons. Without growth, there is no money to support the rebuilding of our vital public services and no prosperity for hardworking people and families.\n\nBut what drives growth? And how can a regulator like the CMA play a part? Well, we know that dynamic, competitive markets drive growth. But another thing we know for sure is that business investment drives growth and that here in the UK we struggle with business investment.\n\nLast year, the UK again delivered the lowest level of business investment in the G7. This has been true for far too long. And this is where the CMA comes in — because in my experience, there are many factors in any investment decision but a big one is confidence in a stable, coherent and well-informed regulatory environment.\n\nThis is our north star: a regulatory environment that encourages the greatest possible level of business investment, subject to respecting the absolute importance of healthy competition and strong consumer protection. We want both domestic and international businesses to see the UK as a great place to invest.\n\nThis means giving start-ups and venture backers the confidence to launch their businesses here, not elsewhere in the world. It means encouraging multinationals — who have a pretty much free choice to place their investments anywhere in the Emea timezone — to choose the UK. And it means giving our domestic businesses the encouragement and confidence to get on and invest.\n\nWhat does that mean in practice and what is the CMA going to do differently? Well, here are three simple — but powerful — things we want to drive forward.\n\nFirst, efficiency: we have to make our investigations and processes as simple and rapid as possible. We know it costs businesses when they have to deal with lengthy and uncertain investigations. Good decisions, clear decisions, rapid decisions — that’s what you tell us you need and that’s on us to deliver. We’re already off to a great start with the “4Ps” framework announced by our CEO late last year. Proportionality, predictability, process and pace are all critical areas for us to dig into and I am confident we can make real progress in the near future.\n\nSecond, expertise: the CMA has a wealth of talent and a committed workforce. But we also know businesses can find it frustrating when they feel they have to spend their time educating us about their sector dynamics and issues. And, of course, the deeper our understanding, the better the decisions we make will be. So, once again, we’ve listened. We will build mechanisms to ensure we invest in, and can access, world class expertise to enable a rapid, meaningful and grown-up conversation with every sector we investigate.\n\nFinally, engagement. Ultimately, we serve UK consumers. But our work has a direct impact on businesses across the UK and those looking to grow and invest here. So it’s essential we engage directly and meaningfully with the business community. Our commitment is an open door, open ears and open minds.\n\nWe’re not naive and we’ll never move away from a belief in the power of competition and consumer protection. But we want to hear what works for you — what’s going to give you the confidence to invest. We’re looking forward to the first meeting of the CMA’s Growth and Investment Council today to do just that. The council was launched at the start of this year and brings together the leaders of 12 major UK business and investor groups.\n\nWe love the UK. Now it’s time to work together to make it a brilliant place to invest, and to drive the productivity, growth and prosperity we all want to see.",

    "blurb": "Scale and cost of construction could pose bigger barriers than political opposition",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Heathrow’s management is poised to relaunch plans to build a third runway at the airport, assuming the government signals its strong support this week, marking the return of one of the UK’s most expensive and controversial infrastructure projects.\n\nBosses at the UK’s hub airport are keen to seize on the sudden window of political opportunity that has opened up, with chancellor Rachel Reeves expected to signal her backing for the expansion in a major speech on economic growth this week.\n\nHeathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye has long said the airport would only press ahead with the full support of government.\n\nThe prospect of a third runway at Heathrow has alarmed residents, environmental groups and some Labour politicians, concerned about the prospect of higher carbon emissions as well as noise and air pollution in the local area.\n\nBut it is the scale and cost of the construction that could pose the biggest barrier to expansion.\n\nPeople briefed on the airport’s plans said that if it went ahead, the current thinking would favour updating the pre-pandemic blueprint for a multibillion-pound megaproject outside the current perimeter.\n\nAs well as a 3.5km runway and taxiways on land to the north-west of the airport’s current boundary, the work would also involve diverting the nearby M25 motorway into a tunnel to make room for the expansion. In the process, 750 homes and a primary school would be demolished.\n\nOther options, such as a smaller third runway within the airport’s current boundaries, are not being considered, the people said, in part because the northwestern runway project has been through six years of scrutiny and was backed by a government-appointed Airports Commission in 2015, parliament in 2018 and the Supreme Court in 2020.\n\nThe biggest unknown is the project’s price tag. A third runway at Heathrow would be one of the most expensive private sector infrastructure projects in the UK. The estimated cost was £14bn in 2014, but that number would now be far higher.\n\nNoble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, said the costs had been rising quickly, and there were now questions over whether the UK had the construction skills to deliver a project of that size.\n\nA third runway would compete for workers with the government’s plans to build 1.5mn homes over five years, as well as more transport and water infrastructure, data centres and gigafactories.\n\nThe number of people working in construction has fallen by 366,000 in the past five years and is at its second-lowest level since 2001.\n\n“The big question in construction is who will actually do all the work and how much more will it cost,” Francis said. “It’s very unclear whether we have the skills.”\n\nAviation industry executives believe the expansion is so politically and technically challenging that Heathrow will want Reeves to go beyond simply signalling her approval for the idea of a third runway this week.\n\nThe airport’s management will want clarity on how the government’s planning reforms could smooth the way, including potential delays caused by judicial reviews, and a commitment to redrawing the UK’s airspace to fit in all the new flights.\n\nBut, most of all, the government will need to agree to reform how Heathrow is financed.\n\nAs a regional monopoly, the airport is funded via the regulated asset base model much like the water companies, which raise equity and debt and recover the costs from consumers.\n\nHeathrow is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority, which agrees every five years on how much can be recouped from the take-off and landing charges it levies on airlines. These charges and the cost of servicing Heathrow’s debt, at present about £19bn, are passed on to passengers.\n\nHeathrow and its airline customers agree the airport’s charging model needs to be reformed, but do not agree on how.\n\nOne option would be a far longer charging cycle — potentially as much as 25 years — to run alongside the current system to help pay for the runway.\n\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of lobby group Airlines UK, said carriers backed growth, but it must be “affordable, aligned with industry’s net zero commitments and deliver meaningful improvements in operational resilience”.\n\nThe airport’s next steps would be to submit a planning application for expansion, which would need to be granted a “development consent order” by the transport secretary.\n\nWhile there are live DCO applications for the Gatwick and Luton expansions, Heathrow’s plans are not as advanced.\n\nSome experts believe the challenges of building a third runway are so significant that the project will never get off the ground.\n\nThe government has previously said no runway expansion would be authorised unless it is compatible with meeting Britain’s climate targets, complies with noise pollution and air pollution limits and provides economic growth across the country.\n\nPaul McGuinness, chair of the No 3rd Runway Coalition pressure group, said: “Expansions at other London airports undermine the case for Heathrow’s uniquely complicated and costly third runway, making it an even riskier, if not uninvestable proposition.”\n\nSir Keir Starmer, prime minister, voted against the scheme in 2018. Sir Sadiq Khan, Labour mayor of London, last week said that if Heathrow came back “with plans for a new runway that was supported by the government, I wouldn’t hesitate to launch, with partners and colleagues, another legal challenge”.\n\nThe airport’s new board met last week, following a change in its ownership, in which French private equity group Ardian and Saudi Arabia’s deep-pocketed sovereign wealth fund bought a 38 per cent stake.\n\nThe board was supportive of expanding the airport in principle, ahead of hearing more details from Reeves, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nTony Travers, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, said it was a key moment for the government.\n\nHe said: “The scale of opposition to a third runway at Heathrow means the chancellor’s renewed interest in it poses the ultimate test of the government’s commitment to growth. Drive a third runway through, and pretty much any planning obstacle can be overcome.”",

    "blurb": "SNIB faces potential shortfall of £400mn on £2bn lending budget, estimates show ",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "The Scottish National Investment Bank is at risk of missing its target of investing £2bn by the end of the decade by a fifth, after the government scaled back funding for the lender this year.\n\nThe state bank could fall short of its 2030 goal in three areas — net zero, communities and innovation — by as much as £400mn, according to previously unreported figures from its annual report.\n\nEstablished in 2020, the bank has a mandate to fund projects that cut carbon emissions, reduce inequality and promote innovation. The institution has a target to lend £2bn to businesses over 10 years.\n\nThe bank has previously come under scrutiny for getting off to a slow start in its early phases and for previously failing to meet its annual spending targets.\n\nThe lender’s performance improved in the 2023-24 financial year, with it investing in green infrastructure and housing projects. The figure was £227mn up from £151.9mn the previous year, while its income exceeded operating costs for the first time.\n\nThe bank said it was a “long-term impact investor”, with 39 businesses and projects now in its portfolio.\n\n“To date we have committed £696mn to business and projects that deliver against at least one of our three missions of net zero, innovation and community, crowding in over £1.4bn of additional investment alongside us,” it said.\n\nIn its annual report published in August, the bank’s projected spending by 2030 was between £800mn and £1bn on net zero projects, and £400mn-£500mn each on both communities and innovation projects.\n\nAt the lower end of the range, this suggests a potential shortfall of £400mn against the £2bn total target.\n\nIn its most recent business plan the lender said it was “aiming at the top end of each range and, where we can, exceeding it”. But it warned the targets were also “subject to real-world volatilities . . . and external or market factors beyond our control”.\n\nSNIB chief executive Al Denholm said in its latest business plan: “Over the longer-term, significant investment from private sector capital is needed if we are to meet our missions.\n\n“The bank cannot deliver its missions alone. So, in the years ahead we seek to manage private sector capital alongside the public funds entrusted to us.”\n\nThe Edinburgh-based bank was established in 2020 with a mandate to create long-term economic growth under then first minister Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nThe bank received just £174mn for the 2024-25 financial year, well shy of the expected £250mn, which it said was “clearly in the context of challenging public sector finances”.\n\nA person close to the bank said the lender might not be able to invest the full £174mn allocation with just over two months left in the financial year. The funding allocated by the government varies annually, and is not set at about £200mn per year.\n\nThe person noted the bank was only in its fifth year, and that establishing a pipeline and a portfolio of investments took time.\n\nDeputy first minister Kate Forbes said the bank’s performance showed it had an “increasingly promising future” following the publication of its annual report in August.\n\nThe bank has invested in ventures ranging from green infrastructure projects and rental home and venture capital funds, to a nanomaterial producer, a laser manufacturer and the company that turned an unused quarry into Europe’s largest inland surf resort.\n\nRoss Brown, a professor of entrepreneurship at the University of St Andrews, said that meeting the £2bn goal was “mission impossible”, while accusing the bank of a “chronic underspend and lack of focus in [its] lending portfolio”.",

    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Rental prices outside London fell quarter on quarter in late 2024 for the first time since before the pandemic, signalling a “key milestone” in Great Britain’s housing market after years of soaring rents.\n\nThe average advertised rent of properties beyond the capital fell 0.2 per cent to £1,341 between the third and the fourth quarter of 2024, marking the first drop since the end of 2019, according to data from the property portal Rightmove on Tuesday.\n\nIn London, a marginal 0.1 cent quarter-on-quarter growth in rental prices to £2,695 was the lowest since early 2021.\n\nWhile modest, Rightmove said the drop marked a “key milestone” for the market as it brought an end to many months of record high rents, helped by weakened demand and improved supply of properties for tenants.\n\nIn the three years to the fourth quarter of 2023, rents in Great Britain excluding London rose 25 per cent, the data showed, boosted by higher borrowing costs and low availability of properties to rent.\n\n“A first quarterly drop in rents is the culmination of several months of improvement in the balance between supply and demand,” said Rightmove’s property expert Colleen Babcock.\n\nDemand pressures appear to be easing in the housing market, with Rightmove reporting a 16 per cent year-on-year decline in prospective tenant enquiries, as some renters opt to buy homes amid lower mortgage rates and rising wages.\n\nSome tenants are also choosing to stay put rather than move because of costs, according to Rightmove.\n\nAdditionally, the supply of rental properties improved in the last quarter of 2024, with a 13 per cent increase in availability compared with the previous year, the research showed.\n\nRightmove said that while there was evidence of some landlords choosing to leave the market, other “perhaps larger” ones were continuing to invest.\n\nHowever, the average number of applications per rental property was still in double digits at 10 — double the pre-pandemic average, indicating a still “very busy” market.\n\nThis comes ahead of the increase in stamp duty announced in the Budget and taking effect in the spring. From April 1, the level at which the property levy becomes payable reverts to £300,000 from £425,000 for first-time buyers and to £125,000 from £250,000 for others.\n\nThe renters’ rights bill, which aims to reform the private rental sector and end “no fault” evictions, could also affect the market. But Rightmove noted “no major signs of an immediate impact” from the legislation which could come into effect this year.\n\nThe Rightmove rental price tracker, as well as similar data from Homelet and Zoopla, provide a more timely indicator of rental trends than the official data, as they track new tenancies rather than all rents.\n\nRents outside London were still 4.7 per cent higher than at the end of 2023. However, price growth marked its slowest annual pace since early 2021.\n\nIn the capital, rental prices were up 2.4 per cent year on year, the lowest annual rate since early 2021.\n\nAlex Bloxham, partner and head of residential lettings at the property consultancy Bidwells, said: “We’re seeing a cooling of what has been a ferociously hot rental market over the last year, where tenants have endured intense competition and consistent rental inflation.”",

    "blurb": "Sir Keir Starmer’s plan is intended to drive investment by companies and boost economic growth",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer will promise on Tuesday to unlock some of the £160bn of surplus held in corporate defined-benefit pension schemes, in a bid to inject a surge of cash into the British economy and boost growth.\n\nThe UK prime minister will tell an audience of executives in the City of London that restrictions on the use of pension surpluses will be eased, a move praised by former Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt.\n\nStarmer’s decision is intended to drive investment by businesses while also encouraging them to take more risk in their pension investment strategies. “Today’s changes will unlock billions for investment,” Starmer said.\n\nThe government estimates that about 3,750 corporate defined-benefit pension schemes are in surplus, holding £160bn of assets in excess of the payments they owe to their members. Less than £70bn is eligible to be returned to companies under current rules. Total assets in the system are £1.2tn.\n\n“This reform has the potential to fundamentally change the way employers view their defined-benefit pension schemes, transforming them from liabilities to offload, into valuable assets worth running on for the longer term,” said Morten Nilsson, chief executive of Brightwell, which manages the BT pension scheme, the largest in the FTSE 100. BT’s scheme is in deficit.\n\nAfter several weeks in which chancellor Rachel Reeves has made a series of growth-related announcements, Starmer’s move on Tuesday will be an answer to critics that he has taken a back seat on the economy.\n\n“To achieve the change our country needs requires nothing short of rewiring our economy,” Starmer will tell the bosses of Lloyds, Nationwide and Tesco, along with other executives. “It needs creative reform, the removal of hurdles and unrelenting focus.”\n\nThe pension reforms follow criticism from some business leaders that Starmer and Reeves have undermined growth with a £40bn Budget tax rise, a thicket of new employment laws and gloomy rhetoric.\n\nHunt floated the defined-benefit pension reforms in his 2023 Mansion House speech but ran out of time to deliver them before last year’s election, which delivered Starmer and Labour into power.\n\n“I may have my political differences with Rachel Reeves on business tax rises but I strongly welcome the momentum she has put behind the Mansion House reforms,” Hunt told the Financial Times.\n\nUnder Labour’s plans, DB schemes could change their rules to permit surplus extraction where the employer and the trustees of the pension scheme agree. The plans would require legislation.\n\nCurrently, DB scheme surplus can only be accessed where schemes passed a resolution by 2016 to retain the power, under a 2004 law passed by the last Labour government. Some schemes had large deficits and did not pass such resolutions.\n\nSurpluses are also only accessible if they exceed the level needed for a business to sell its scheme to an insurer. The UK’s Pension Protection Fund estimates that £68bn of the £160bn of the total current surplus meets this threshold.\n\nAround £180mn of surplus was accessed by companies between 2018 to 2023, according to government estimates last year. Businesses are taxed at 25 per cent on surpluses they receive.\n\nPension scheme funding levels have improved dramatically in recent years because higher government bond yields have increased expected returns on assets, therefore reducing the current accounting value of future liabilities.\n\nPension trustees welcomed the government’s announcement, provided member outcomes were protected.\n\n“All trustees really care about is paying scheme members, but as a general theme we would be supportive of releasing surpluses in the right circumstances,” said Vassos Vassou, council member of the Association of Professional Pension Trustees.\n\nHe noted that in recent years, companies with large surpluses in their pension schemes had opted to sell them to insurance companies in bulk annuity transactions called buyouts. About £50bn of pension obligations have been sold in each of the past two years, according to consultancy WTW.\n\nSome advisers are sceptical that many companies will make use of Labour’s reforms. “I just don’t think there will be many people who want to do it — either they want to do a buyout or just put more money into the scheme until they can,” said John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant. He noted the 25 per cent tax levied on cash extracted from pension surpluses.\n\nOn Monday Reeves urged Labour MPs to get behind the growth strategy, with some backbenchers nervous that the party is damaging its environmental credentials and appearing to side with business over consumer interests.\n\n“If we get this right — and I know we will — the prize on offer is immense,” she told the Parliamentary Labour party. Reeves, who has been criticised by business for appearing to talk the economy down, urged Labour MPs to be positive. “Now is the chance for us to shout about that potential and the brighter future ahead,” she said.\n\nShe added: “Over the past six months as chancellor, my experience is that government has become used to saying ‘no’. That must change. We must start saying ‘yes’.”",

    "body": "Britain is on course to fall far short of its targets for developing new solar and wind power despite the government’s efforts to lift barriers and boost the industry, according to new analysis.\n\nPractical hurdles and uncertainty over market reforms mean that the UK is set to miss its clean energy targets by 32 gigawatts, enough to power tens of millions of homes, said consultancy Cornwall Insight in a report.\n\nThe findings are a blow to Sir Keir Starmer’s government, which has made decarbonising Britain’s electricity system by 2030 a key goal.\n\nTom Musker, modelling manager at Cornwall Insight, said the analysis “underscored the urgent need to address both the operational and investment barriers slowing renewables growth.\n\n“Timely investment in infrastructure, clarity on market reforms, and support for innovative project delivery are vital to unlocking the UK’s clean energy potential,” he added.\n\nIn order to meet its target of a clean electricity system in five years, the government said last year it wanted the UK by 2030 to have 43-50GW of offshore wind, 27-29GW of onshore wind and 45-47GW of solar power.\n\nAt present, the UK has 14.7GW of offshore wind, 15.7GW of onshore wind and 17.6GW of solar power, according to government and industry figures.\n\nHowever, Cornwall Insight forecast there would be only 37GW of offshore wind, 17GW of onshore wind and 29GW of solar by 2030 — leaving a combined shortfall of 32GW.\n\nMinisters have taken steps to boost conditions for the industry, including lifting restrictions on onshore wind in England, awarding planning permission to new solar farms and increasing the budget for subsidies for renewable energy.\n\nThe National Energy System Operator has also acted to cut the time it takes to connect to Britain’s massively oversubscribed electricity grid, including pausing new applications in order to tackle the backlog.\n\nLast week the government also confirmed it would cut the number of times opponents to an infrastructure project can apply for judicial review, after concerns that objections from nearby residents risked delaying new projects.\n\nBut Kate Mulvany, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said even with such measures “it’s fair to say we are not there yet”.\n\n“The messaging has been strong; there were some very definite decisions during the first month in office,” she added. “But that isn’t the same as getting wholesale planning reform agreed, and given the contentiousness of wholesale planning reform, there is a degree of caution around how rapidly that will ultimately be delivered.”\n\nDevelopers are also cautious about investing while waiting for the government to decide on whether to push ahead with major potential changes to the electricity market, such as splitting it into different pricing zones, Mulvany added.\n\nTo make its forecasts, Cornwall takes into account a range of factors including market sentiment and project announcements. In a similar forecast this time last year, it predicted Britain would have 17GW of onshore wind, 31GW of offshore wind and 21GW of solar by 2030.\n\nLast year’s figures for offshore wind and solar were lower than its new predictions, suggesting the government’s policies will have made some difference.\n\nHowever, Cornwall cautioned that the forecasts were not directly comparable because of changes to the way it carried out its modelling.\n\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it did “not recognise” the forecasts, pointing to NESO analysis that showed “clean power by 2030 is achievable”.\n\n“We are cleaning up a dysfunctional grid system to connect the most important projects, speeding up decisions on planning permission and expanding the renewable auction process to stop delays, unlocking growth”.",

    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Good morning. What should we be talking about in the wake of the Southport murders?\n\nOn Friday, I set out why Axel Rudakubana did not fit into either of the British state’s models for dealing with people who might end committing crimes such as his. For people with specific mental illnesses, hopefully they end up being detained under the terms of the Mental Health Act. And for people who would kill for a cause, hopefully they are spotted by Prevent and dissuaded from supporting or committing terrorist acts. (Or they are stopped and arrested before carrying out a terrorist plot.)\n\nWhether the UK’s approach to identifying and combating terrorism should change as a result, and if so how, are going to be a topic of serious debate over the coming days, weeks and months. We expect the imminent publication of the review into when Rudakubana came into contact with Prevent and what the counter-terrorism programme could have done differently. I will set out my thinking on it once I’ve digested the report.\n\nFor now I want to talk about the arguments advanced by the leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch, that what we really should be talking about in the wake of these murders is “integration”, partly because some of what she is missing is important to my concerns about the broader criticisms being made of the UK’s Prevent programme. Some more on that below.\n\nAxel Rudakubana was born and raised in the UK. His parents, who were Tutsis who had left Rwanda before the genocide, were Christians (like 92 per cent of people in Rwanda). They were both churchgoers. As an 11-year-old, he appeared in a commercial for Children in Need dressed as Doctor Who. But as he entered his teenage years, something changed. He became obsessed with violence. He came into contact with various bits of the state, none of which spotted the danger that he posed.\n\nSo when Kemi Badenoch says “it is absurd that we are debating online knife sales more than we are integration and how we safeguard our societies from ideologies and violence”, it is hard, frankly, to see how that relates to this case.\n\nIn terms of the broader question of “how do we keep British citizens safe from terror”, yes. According to the most recent data release, there were 234 people in prison in Great Britain for terrorism-connected offences. Of those, 65 per cent are categorised as holding Islamist-extremist views, 27 per cent are categorised as following extreme rightwing ideologies. The remainder hold “Other” ideologies — mostly causes that have been the inspiration for terrorism in the recent past, such as animal rights. Their threat has, for the moment, been pretty comprehensively dismantled by counter-terrorism police and the security services.\n\nSafeguarding the UK from ideologically motivated terrorism is a much bigger deal and challenge than random acts of violence motivated by obsession with violence, at least at the moment. Identifying and tackling problems of ideology is both what Prevent is set up to do, but it is also how we distinguish between terrorism and all other forms of crime.\n\nAnd indeed, one important thing that we need to balance when we consider how and if the UK’s approach to countering terror and extremism should change is whether any alterations would damage our efforts against these much larger threats. (That, and other topics, is the subject of a must-read piece by the UK’s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall, which you can read here.)\n\nBut in terms of the specifics of this case, no. Actually “just how hard should we make it for the rest of us to buy knives?” is a relevant policy debate. “What does the UK do well and badly in terms of integrating people into the country?” isn’t. Badenoch was pressed on the topic by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg yesterday and she gave the following answer (emphasis mine):\n\nI am really not sure where Badenoch has got this idea from: Rudakubana had materials about genocides and atrocities, yes. The more than 164,000 pieces of material he had ranged from Gaza, to Grozny, to Iraq, to the genocide in Rwanda and the Holocaust. I suppose some of that could be categorised as “white genocide” but Badenoch seems to have unearthed a motive and a consistency to Rudakubana’s interests that neither the Crown Prosecution Service nor the police have. (Over on Bluesky, Sunder Katwala offers a plausible theory as to the source of Badenoch’s belief.)\n\nWhen pressed by Kuenssberg on where she had the evidence for her claims about integration, Badenoch responded:\n\nBut Badenoch’s background is not similar to Rudakubana. She was born in the UK (in an era when being born in the UK still gave you an automatic right to citizenship) but she spent the first 16 years of her life in Nigeria. Rudakubana was born in the UK and grew up in the UK. These backgrounds are about as far apart as well, the 2,000 or so miles separating Nigeria from Rwanda.\n\nThis is part of what looks to be a pattern: that Badenoch does not familiarise herself with the particulars of a policy row or a subject but defaults to what her prior convictions tell her, regardless of whether they fit the facts or not.\n\nI think that her failure to do the reading also explains this Guardian scoop. In 2015, when Badenoch was a member of the Greater London Authority, she was one of the co-authors of a report that criticised Prevent, suggesting that the programme could alienate communities. Such terms are near-identical to the ones she now castigates Keir Starmer and Yvette Cooper for signing up to. (She said on X last week: “When the Conservatives were trying to toughen the Prevent anti-extremism programme, [Keir] Starmer and [Yvette] Cooper were running for office on manifestos worried about Prevent ‘alienating communities’.”)\n\nI don’t think that her failure to write a dissenting opinion, as one other member of that GLA committee did, is because her “true” opinions are closer to Labour’s 2019 manifesto than she lets on. I think it’s because in 2015 she didn’t do the reading, just as she has yet to demonstrate a grip on a topic at Prime Minister’s Questions. This is obviously a problem because our system works best when the leader of the opposition is across the detail of what the government is doing.\n\nBut it is particularly important on this topic, because the specifics of this case are so unlike most of the threats the UK faces. When the government proposes some potentially far-reaching changes to our response to terrorism works, the leader of the opposition really needs to be across the facts of this specific set of crimes to do her job properly.\n\nFor reasons I don’t fully understand, when I try and read a grown-up novel in January and February, my brain revolts: I read slowly, fitfully and there is no pleasure in it. I used to fight against this but the only consequence was to prolong the problem. So in the first two months of the year, I either read non-fiction or children’s literature. At the moment I am rereading what I think is actually my favourite of Salman Rushdie’s many excellent novels, Haroun and the Sea of Stories, one of two novels he wrote for his children.",

    "body": "The writer is director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce\n\nThis is a difficult time for British business, but the economy is not on its knees and decisive government action can still lift the gloom. The challenges we face are well understood. Rising employer costs, including the increase in national insurance contributions, are squeezing margins. Post-Brexit customs arrangements continue to create complexity for companies trading with the EU.\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce quarterly economic survey — the largest poll of business sentiment since October’s Budget — found confidence at its lowest level since autumn 2022. Companies need ministers to provide a clear pathway to sustainable economic growth and one of the keys to this is investment in infrastructure. The evidence is clear: well-planned infrastructure projects not only create jobs, they also generate lasting economic benefits that hugely benefit regions and often the whole country.\n\nConsider Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). This potentially transformative project — a modern railway between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and more — exemplifies the multiplying potential of infrastructure investment. The link will do more than simply connect these cities: it will serve as a powerful economic catalyst, injecting £118bn into the northern economy by 2050. Through increased capacity and reduced journey times, it will forge stronger business connections and expand labour markets, creating opportunities for millions.\n\nBut the benefits stretch further. NPR and other projects like it are a massive stimulus through the supply chains of any local economy. They support the obvious industries — construction, manufacturing and logistics — as well as retail, hospitality for visiting workers and tech support.\n\nThe returns on such investments are compelling. Take the Ely and Haughley junction improvements, which promise to deliver nearly £5 in economic benefits for every £1 invested — a return that would impress any business leader.\n\nIn aviation, Gatwick’s Northern Runway Project demonstrates how private investment can drive public benefit, with £2.2bn of private capital creating 14,000 new jobs and contributing £1bn annually to the local economy. The recent announcement by the chancellor of support for this project — alongside expansion at Luton and a third runway at Heathrow — are big promises and show a government unafraid to take difficult decisions to deliver growth.\n\nWe applaud this and welcome planned limits on spurious lawfare that allows vested interests to seemingly delay every proposal. Judicial review is too often a tool for the few to stand in the way of the interests of the many.\n\nBut the battle is far from won. The government must now deliver on its promises. Because it isn’t just transport projects affected right now. Every day wasted is another solar farm pushed back and another high-voltage undersea cable becoming that much more expensive.\n\nEnergy infrastructure is crucial to our economic future. The Sizewell C nuclear reactor represents more than just power generation. It embodies economic regeneration and a vote of confidence in the UK, 25,000 construction jobs and opportunities across the supply chain.\n\nEconomic growth and meeting net zero targets are not a zero-sum game. Strategic investment in energy infrastructure has the unique potential to benefit the entire country, while helping to meet our climate goals. In the long term, we will benefit from cheaper, more secure supplies — but only if we build capacity now.\n\nOur international competitors are not standing still. To avoid being left behind, the UK needs streamlined planning processes and stable policy frameworks to encourage private investment. The business case is clear: strategic infrastructure investment is not an expense — it’s a downpayment on our collective future. There is no time to waste.",

    "body": "UK banks have urged the Bank of England to dilute its plans for handling failing lenders, arguing that they go beyond equivalent rules in the US or the EU, and will impose “significant costs” on the sector.\n\nThe City of London’s clash with the central bank comes as the government is pressing regulators to do more to revive economic growth by slashing the bureaucratic burden faced by businesses.\n\nTrade body UK Finance said the BoE would “create capital instabilities” and be “burdensome” for the sector if it gives itself extra powers to wipe out a special form of debt that is designed to be written-off during a crisis.\n\nThe lobby group’s response to the BoE, seen by the Financial Times, said the central bank should raise thresholds for which banks need such loss-absorbing debt more than it is currently planning. Failure to do so would be “a disincentive to investors” and harm the sector’s competitiveness, it said. The thresholds are set by asset size and number of active accounts. Financiers estimate that at least five fast-growing banks, such as Revolut, are likely to soon be caught by the requirement to issue the loss-absorbing debt.\n\nUnder rules introduced after the 2008 financial crisis, banks above a certain size need an extra layer of debt that regulators can wipe out or convert to equity in a crisis, known as MREL — minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. This is designed to avoid governments ever needing to use taxpayer funds to rescue failed lenders.\n\nThe rules came under fresh scrutiny after the BoE intervened to transfer the UK subsidiary of failed US lender Silicon Valley Bank to HSBC over a weekend in 2023.\n\nIn response, the government introduced new legislation allowing the BoE to use funds from the sector’s deposit insurance scheme to finance the transfer of a failed bank to a rival.\n\nThe BoE said in October it planned to introduce a “contractual trigger” into loss-absorbing debt that allowed officials to wipe it out if the foreign parent of a British bank is put into resolution, even if the UK subsidiary remains operationally viable.\n\nUK Finance said regulators in other jurisdictions “have not taken such an expansive approach to the use of contractual triggers” and warned the plans would create “significant challenges” for lenders.\n\nThe sector fears that it would be costly to rewrite the terms of billions pounds worth of loss-absorbing debt to give the BoE this extra power, while warning it could change the accounting treatment of the securities. UK Finance said the central bank should at least exclude existing debt.\n\nIn October, the BoE said it planned to raise the size threshold above which banks need to raise such debt from total assets of £15bn-£25bn to £20bn-£30bn. It also said banks caught by a separate threshold based on the number of active accounts would no longer have to raise this loss-absorbing debt.\n\nUK Finance called for the central bank to go further by increasing the size threshold to £40bn-£50bn to take account of inflation since the rule was introduced in 2015. It also called for the active account threshold to be scrapped or raised from 40,000-80,000 to 100,000-150,000.\n\nRevolut, which was granted a UK banking licence last year, increased its total assets from £14.1bn in 2022 to £17.4bn in 2023. The bank declined to comment.\n\nUK Finance said its proposals were designed to “reflect technological advances and consumer preferences, alongside regulatory reforms in the past few years and to be consistent with major international jurisdictions such as the EU and US”.\n\nThe BoE said the consultation ended on Friday and it was considering responses.",

    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The writer is senior vice-president and economist at Pimco\n\nUK government bond yields are off to a volatile start to the year. After rising sharply in the first two weeks — by roughly 0.3 percentage points for five-year gilts — they have now returned to where they started. While there is noise around fiscal policy, the moves have largely been driven by global factors. US bond yields have exhibited similar volatility.\n\nBond markets in the UK may be more sensitive to fiscal credibility following the turbulence after the 2022 Liz Truss budget. But fiscal sustainability in the UK does not significantly differ from some peers, including France, which has a higher fiscal deficit and more rapidly rising debt.\n\nThe UK remains an outlier, however, on the other side of the policy ledger. The Bank of England’s policy rate of 4.75 per cent is now the highest among large developed countries. That is weighing on activity. Economic growth has stagnated since the summer, and labour demand has fallen sharply. Inflation has eased in the past year and is now in the “two-point-something” range, close to the BoE’s target of 2 per cent. It’s no surprise, then, that at its December meeting the BoE repeated its intention to lower its policy rate ahead.\n\nBut how low will it go? Unlike many other central banks, the BoE has not provided clear guidance. Estimating the equilibrium rate, where monetary policy is neither tight or loose, requires a great deal of humility. It depends on factors affecting the supply and demand for capital, which naturally change over time.\n\nA simple way to estimate it is by looking at economic growth. High-growth countries attract more investment and encourage less saving, pushing rates higher. By this measure, the market’s expected long-term interest rate in the UK seems high. Productivity has only increased by 0.5 per cent (annualised) since the pandemic began, slightly below its pre-pandemic rate and less than a third of that in the US — and actual productivity may be even lower owing to ongoing issues with the labour force survey data, which probably under-reports employment levels.\n\nInflation puts upward pressure on interest rates, too. Although core inflation in the UK — at 3.2 per cent over the past year — remains slightly higher than in most other developed countries, it’s trending down. Underlying price pressures, excluding one-time tax shocks, are easing, especially in services. Based on medium-term inflation expectations, the central bank’s credibility is intact and we see few reasons why the UK will have structurally higher inflation than in other countries.\n\nYet markets remain sceptical, expecting only a few cuts ahead to a final destination of around 4 per cent. This outlook may reflect concerns that increased government spending could lead to higher inflation. Markets might also question the government’s commitment to its new fiscal rules, given its recent history of adjustments. Like Italy, but unlike most other large, developed countries, the UK borrows money at a much higher interest rate than its underlying economic growth rate, worsening debt dynamics.\n\nWe have a more benign central view for inflation, even if we acknowledge that fiscal policy adds uncertainty. Despite increased government spending, taxes will rise too, leaving fiscal policy tight. The net effect will probably drag on activity and employment, as already evident in recent surveys. Firms may pass some of the National Insurance hike on to consumers, but that would be a price level adjustment — like a value added tax or tariff hike. Typically, that is something central banks look through. And we would be very surprised if the government did not adjust taxation or spending to meet its fiscal rules, given the bond market’s recent volatility.\n\nAs such, we expect UK gilt yields to decline. The five-year gilt yield is now only a fraction lower than that in the US and we expect it to fall below the US level over time, similar to the five years before the pandemic. While the risks of rates going higher remain — near-term inflation expectations have edged higher in recent months — there are more reasons to expect rates to fall, given increased global trade uncertainty, tight fiscal policy and a generally soft growth outlook.\n\nAs for the policy rate, our internal models point to a neutral interest rate of 2 to 3 per cent in the UK. Even if the BoE is cautious with rate cuts in the first half of this year, we see room for the rate to fall by more than the market expects. The BoE might eventually follow other central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Riksbank in pivoting to faster cuts.",

    "body": "The early weeks of 2025 have been awash with news headlines about a bond market sell-off. However, investment platform AJ Bell points out that there are always two sides to every market story — and the rise in yields as bond prices fall means retail investors’ appetite for UK government bonds is picking up.\n\nIn January, the UK Treasury sold £4.25bn-worth of five-year gilts at an average yield of 4.49 per cent, with £12.74bn-worth of bids received. AJ Bell customers were among those fuelling this strong demand in the auction.\n\nAnd they were not alone. At the end of last year, many analysts were pointing out that the time had come to invest in bonds. The recovery from 2022, the worst year for bonds, has been robust. “Some high yield managers have been doing as well as global equities over the past two years,” points out Tideway Wealth’s investment director Nick Gait.\n\nBonds can offer an attractive income that is regular, predictable and contractual. But they are also good portfolio diversifiers, able to offset poor performance when equity markets decline in value — and some wealth managers already believe the bull market in equities is looking a bit long in the tooth.\n\nTideway Wealth even has some clients whose self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) are 100 per cent invested in fixed income. The rationale is that, while the US-led bull market in equities may continue, the downside risks are increasing. Bonds with real yields may be a good alternative for older investors — or those in pension drawdown.\n\n“The higher government bond yields go, the greater the competition against equities for investors’ money,” says Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. “At some point, investors will take the view that they can get a decent yield from bonds for lower risk compared with investing in stocks.”\n\nAnother factor that has made fixed income look more attractive is a slowdown in inflation after years of rapidly rising consumer prices.\n\n“Inflation moving from a high rate to a low or normal rate is not something we have experienced in a generation, so investors have forgotten just how attractive this environment can be for fixed income,” notes April LaRusse, head of investment specialists at Insight Investment.\n\nMateusz Malek, head of bond research at Killik & Co adds: “Although we have recently entered the period when inflation is expected to reaccelerate slightly, overall, it is forecast to remain contained and below the level of yields offered by bonds.” Interest rate cuts could also boost bond returns.\n\nHowever, Thomas Becket, co-chief investment officer of Canaccord Genuity Wealth, thinks gilts have been selling off partly because of a repricing of UK interest rate expectations.\n\nThis wobble in the market also serves as a reminder that bonds are not risk free. “Investors are worried about extra borrowing by the UK government to achieve its plans, and the uncertain outlook for the economy given widespread pessimism by businesses and consumers,” says Coatsworth.\n\nHowever, some view the recent yield movements as largely an overreaction to global political uncertainty.\n\n“We believe gilt yields will fall over 2025/26, as the Bank of England unwinds their current restrictive stance, and will eventually reach a level consistent with the fundamentals of the UK economy,” says Matt Tickle chief investment officer at Barnett Waddingham.\n\nIn the UK, private investors can access gilts and T-bills, but investing in corporate bonds is heavily regulated and limited only to professionals. Some wealth managers, such as Killik, will build portfolios of corporate bonds for their clients. Others, like Tideway, use professionally managed bond funds, such as Royal London UK Government Bond, or, for investment-grade credit, the Man Group Sterling Corporate Bond. “We have spoken to our bond fund managers in the wake of recent movements and they are optimistic of high single-digit returns again in 2025,” says Tideway’s Gait.\n\nEven so, investors should always be aware of the two core risks: duration (the measure of interest rate risk the portfolio aims to take) and credit quality (how much risk you’re willing to take to achieve returns).\n\n“Having any certainty over the longer end of the yield curve is perilously hard,” Becket says. “There is no clarity on the outlook for any of interest rates, inflation and government policy improving.”\n\nGait adds: “The greater than 5 per cent return now available on long duration gilts is clearly attracting retail investors, particularly on low coupon bonds where gains will be tax free. But many, I suspect, will underestimate the risks when you buy longer duration.”\n\nThe most popular gilts with retail investors using the Interactive Investor platform at the end of 2024 included T26 and TN28, maturing at the end of January 2026 and January 2028. Because these gilts have coupons of 0.125 per cent and trade below their par value, most of the return comes from the £100 redemption value of each gilt on maturity, which is capital gains tax free — making them popular with investors holding them outside of tax-advantaged individual savings accounts, or SIPPs.\n\n“Gilt prices move when market conditions change, but gilts maturing soon are less volatile than longer-dated gilts,” says Sam Benstead, fixed income lead at Interactive Investor. “If you want a near-guaranteed return, then direct gilts are a good option, particularly bonds maturing soon.”",

    "blurb": "UK’s record of slow growth can be turned around, says Birmingham City FC owner ",
    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The US owner of Birmingham City football club has said the UK can unlock a wave of inbound investment “incredibly quickly” if the government makes tangible progress on its pledge to speed up planning approvals.\n\nTom Wagner, co-founder of Knighthead Capital, told the Financial Times that Britain’s record of under-investment and slow growth could be turned around if Labour made good on its vow to remove obstacles to development.\n\n“There are lots of projects that we are looking at in the UK that we’d love to pursue if the process can be made easier,” he said. “And we’re not the only ones. If things change by just a small amount, there’ll be a lot of capital inflow and a lot of excess growth.”\n\nKnighthead has acquired more than 60 acres of land around Birmingham City’s stadium since taking control of the third-tier team in 2023. The New York-based hedge fund plans to build a new 60,000-seat venue as part of a large £3bn regeneration project involving housing, retail and entertainment space in one of the UK’s poorest neighbourhoods.\n\nThe firm manages about $9bn and has yet to submit formal planning applications for the project, which hinges on local authorities agreeing to set up new transport links. A proposed extension of Birmingham’s tram network through the area has been repeatedly delayed over several years.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has sought in recent weeks to prop up business confidence in the sluggish UK economy, as increased public borrowing and sterling weakness prompted warnings from billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio that the country was heading towards a “debt death spiral”.\n\nWhile Starmer wooed business before taking power in July, promising to “bulldoze through barriers to British success”, including with an overhaul of planning rules, relations were damaged by a £40bn tax-raising Budget that weighed heavily on companies.\n\nWagner said he was still “very bullish” about the UK’s long-term prospects, saying the country had a “highly educated, diverse, dynamic economy” and the “single most exciting city in the world” with the capital London. He conceded that Knighthead’s bet on the UK appeared “contrarian”, but that broader “animal spirits” could return swiftly.\n\n“That can change incredibly quickly if the government begins making progress on its initiatives, which I believe they will do. You’ll see that turn. Once you start seeing some positive momentum, that leads to more positive momentum.”\n\nWith Donald Trump’s return to the White House expected to usher in a period of heightened economic competition and increase the gravitational pull of the US, Wagner said the onus was on governments around the world to make decisions that lowered barriers to investment.\n\n“Capital is highly mobile, it will find the path of least resistance,” he said. “When governments begin making things harder, vis-à-vis other jurisdictions into which that capital may flow, they will suffer.”\n\nIn the UK, Wagner said planning remained the biggest obstacle to investment. “The solutions aren’t that hard to get right. And when I see relatively easy solutions that are in the way of progress and capital investment, I tend to think that the right path will be found,” he said.\n\nLabour has led an overhaul of England’s national planning policy and proposed to limit the influence of local committees, as well as curtail attempts to block development through the courts. But experts have warned the changes could take years to take full effect.\n\nWagner, a former Goldman Sachs distressed debt trader, said Birmingham city council’s financial woes — it was declared bankrupt last year and forced to make drastic cuts to spending — had “very little” impact on Knighthead’s plans so far, and the firm was continuing to buy up land in an area just over a mile away from the city centre.\n\n“We’re hearing all the right things in our conversations. What we need to see now is a bit more action,” he said, adding that he wanted to see real progress this calendar year on the potential extension of the city’s Metro tramline to the site of the proposed new stadium. “We’re confident that they’ll do what needs to be done. If they can’t for this project, well then maybe I’d be more pessimistic on the UK economy more broadly.”\n\nKnighthead’s plans also rely on something even harder to predict: sporting success. Birmingham City were relegated to League One in their first season under US ownership, but are now top of the table of English football’s third tier.\n\nThe team are still getting average attendances at home games of more than 26,000, higher than several Premier League sides, while former NFL star Tom Brady is now an adviser and shareholder at the club.\n\nWagner said the goal was to take Birmingham City back to the Premier League and stay there for a “long period of time”, and in the process rekindle the fierce local rivalry with Aston Villa. “It’s an incredibly ambitious and probably a bit cocky thing to say, but, why bother if that’s not the objective?”",

    "body": "Workers at military contractor Serco are set to strike over a deal being negotiated by the company and the UK’s Royal Navy, which they say could cut “essential” support for Britain’s nuclear deterrent.\n\nTrade union Prospect said up to a quarter of Serco’s UK marine workforce will walk out for a day next month.\n\nThe union wants the company to pause discussions on a 10-year contract to replace Serco’s existing £1.2bn deal with the navy that is expiring this year.\n\nUnion representatives told the Financial Times they were concerned that the new contract could lead to cuts at Serco’s marine business, which employs about 600 people.Under the current contract, Serco operates 91 vessels that provide services such as transporting personnel and moving larger ships to and from land, including the UK’s nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers.\n\nProspect said it was told in a meeting with officials last year that savings of £250mn were being targeted over the duration of the new contract and up to 96 fewer Serco employees would be required.\n\n“The services covered by this contract are essential for national security and for the continuous at-sea deterrent,” said Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary at Prospect. “Pausing now and reconsidering will avoid a costly and dangerous mistake.”\n\nThe UK’s “continuous at-sea deterrent” involves a rotating fleet of nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines, with at least one submarine at sea at any given time.\n\nThe government has said this provides “a credible and effective response option to extreme aggression”.\n\nBut Prospect, which has more than 150 members in Serco’s marine business, said it was concerned the company would struggle to provide a continuous service towing submarines and other navy vessels if the cuts went ahead.The union also warned that it would be difficult to get more staff at a later stage if the navy realised it did not have enough people because it can take years to train replacements.\n\nIt said 87 per cent of members who participated in a ballot voted to strike.“If it continues as planned [this] will mean the loss of vital jobs which it will not be then possible to replace when the navy inevitably realises that it has made a mistake,” Ferns said.The navy services provided by Serco were privatised through a 15-year contract worth £1bn from 2007, with the company getting a 27-month extension worth £200mn in December 2022.\n\nNegotiations for the new contract are being finalised as the new Labour government is enforcing spending controls to ease pressure on its finances. The Ministry of Defence asked major suppliers in August to identify opportunities for budget cuts.\n\nSerco said discussions on the new contract were “ongoing” and that “the level of service we provide on our current contract remains unchanged”.\n\nThe MoD did not comment on the new contract but said operational priorities would “not be affected during the strike”.\n\nThis article has been updated to amend details of a meeting involving Prospect last year about Serco’s proposed new contract with the Royal Navy.",

    "blurb": "UK chancellor expected to support Heathrow airport expansion despite concerns over environmental impact ",
    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Rachel Reeves will on Monday call on Labour MPs to back her plans to boost growth, including a highly contentious proposal to expand Heathrow airport, as a survey pointed to new signs of private sector pessimism about the UK economy.\n\nThe chancellor is facing criticism from some in her party for allegedly siding with business over consumers and for backing a third runway at Britain’s busiest airport, amid fears it could hit the government’s environmental objectives.\n\nBut Reeves will seek to face down her critics when she meets the Parliamentary Labour party on Monday, telling MPs that without growth she will be unable to fund the improvements to public services they want.\n\nHer intervention comes as a new survey by the CBI employers’ group found that private sector companies expect another significant fall in activity over the next three months, with a weighted balance of -22 per cent.\n\nAccording to the CBI’s latest Growth Indicator, expectations are broadly unchanged from December, which were the weakest in more than two years, with particular gloom over the consumer services sector at -49 per cent.\n\nReeves, who met investors at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, will also spend the next two days meeting chief executives in an attempt to persuade them that she has a credible growth strategy.\n\nMany business leaders fear her policies, including a £25bn increase in employers’ national insurance contributions, have contributed to a stagnating economy.\n\nOn Sunday Reeves in effect confirmed that she would endorse the construction of a third runway at Heathrow when she makes a “growth” speech on Wednesday, insisting the aviation industry was becoming greener.\n\nAsked about claims by London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan that the policy would hit clean air and net zero targets, Reeves said: “A lot has changed in terms of aviation.”\n\nShe told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg that more sustainable aviation fuels were becoming available, and that “a third runway will mean that instead of circling London, flights can land at Heathrow”.\n\nReeves said she had already agreed the expansion of London City and Stansted airports and she is also expected on Wednesday to approve expansion at Gatwick and Luton, marking a huge expansion of London airport capacity.\n\nA third runway was first proposed by the last Labour government in 2003 on economic grounds, but subsequent Conservative administrations tried and failed to progress the scheme.\n\nKhan and environmental groups have long opposed it, citing the UK’s legally binding target to reach net zero carbon emissions. But this week energy secretary Ed Miliband, who threatened to resign over the issue during Gordon Brown’s government, said he would not quit his role if the third runway was approved.\n\nPaul McGuinness, chair of the No Third Runway Coalition, said: “Expansions at other London airports undermine the case for Heathrow’s uniquely complicated and costly third runway, making it an even riskier, if not uninvestable proposition.”\n\nLeft-wing Labour MPs are also worried that Reeves is tilting the regulatory landscape in favour of big business and away from consumers, with one saying: “She’s throwing herself at big corporations.”\n\nBut the chancellor insisted on Sunday that without some radical changes Britain would have inadequate growth and that the government would fail to meet its target of 1.5mn new homes in this parliament.\n\n“Too often the answer to new development has been ‘no’. But that is the attitude that has stunted economic growth and left working people worse off,” she said. “I don’t believe low growth is our destiny.”\n\nReeves announced new plans to speed up the construction of new homes near commuter train stations, as part of reforms under a new planning and infrastructure bill.\n\nThe Treasury said the new rules would ensure that when developers submit an application for acceptable types of schemes in key areas — such as near commuter transport hubs — the default answer would be “yes”.\n\nReeves also backed a regeneration project around Old Trafford in Manchester, which has been championed by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.\n\nThe Treasury said it would see “new housing, commercial and public space as a shining example of the bold pro-development model that will drive growth across the region”.\n\nManchester United have plans to rebuild or redevelop Old Trafford, which city leaders claim could drive one of the UK’s “biggest ever urban regeneration projects”.\n\nThe Premier League club will decide by the end of this season whether to build a new 100,000-capacity ground, creating the country’s biggest stadium, or upgrade and expand the existing one.\n\nBurnham dubbed the proposal “the largest opportunity for urban regeneration” since the 2012 London Olympic Games.",

    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government has revived a strategic plan to build transport links and housing between Oxford and Cambridge, the latest sign that Labour is focusing on high-productivity areas of the economy in its push for growth.\n\nThe decision to back the Oxford-Cambridge Arc marks a return to political favour for a scheme that was shelved three years ago after then Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson prioritised “levelling up” poorer regions.\n\nScience secretary Peter Kyle on Monday said the government wanted to double the economic output of the science-rich region that stretches between Britain’s two best-known universities, with the manufacturing and logistics hub of Milton Keynes in between.\n\n“The Oxford-Cambridge Arc is already an engine of prosperity, but we can go even further. We are determined to unleash research and development as a driving force in our mission to grow the economy in every corner of the country,” he said.\n\nNo new money was announced for the Arc on Monday. But the government committed in the October Budget to deliver the East West Rail project that will revive the “Varsity” railway, which connected Oxford and Cambridge until it was closed in 1967.\n\nFast-tracking the scheme, which is inspired by the science clusters of Boston and San Francisco in the US, would add £78bn of GDP to the UK economy by 2035, according to research by consultancy Public First for the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster Board, which comprises industry and university leaders.\n\nThe announcement, which comes ahead of UK chancellor Rachel Reeves’ “growth” speech this week, was welcomed by the vice-chancellors of Oxford and Cambridge universities as well as senior executives at pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca UK and computer chip designer Arm.\n\nSupercluster board chair Andy Williams said its members, “which include some of the world’s largest investors, see extraordinary potential and in this commitment it is abundantly clear that the government does too”.\n\nThe original plan was devised in 2017 by the National Infrastructure Commission and was a top priority of successive Conservative governments, most recently coming back into favour under former prime minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nIt promised to deliver an extra 1mn homes and 700,000 jobs but met with a fierce political backlash from local groups opposed to new developments.\n\nHowever, Sir Keir Starmer, prime minister, has signalled he is prepared to confront such objections, promising to construct 1.5mn homes in this parliament and to “put builders not blockers first” to boost the stagnating economy.\n\nMike Davey, Labour leader of Cambridge City Council, welcomed the backing of the Arc but cautioned it would require investment in more affordable homes, as well as improved water and transport infrastructure.\n\n“The government should learn from the mistakes the Tories made on the Arc — we need to bring local communities with us and they need to see the benefits,” he said.\n\nWhile praising ministers’ ambition for the Arc, senior executives said the plan would require improvements to infrastructure alongside reforms to deliver faster planning permissions, easier access to global workers and capital.\n\nOxford and Cambridge have suffered from shortages of water and electricity that have led to environmental regulators temporarily blocking housing and science developments.\n\nRichard O’Boyle, chief executive of Pioneer Group, which runs life sciences campuses, said OxCam could be a big driver of growth “with the right support” but “to fully unlock its potential we need investment, better infrastructure, and policies that support growth”.\n\nIn a sign of the difficulties of development in the area, a decision on whether to relocate a sewage works in north Cambridge was delayed for a second time in January, in effect freezing a 5,600-home development.\n\nNick Pettit, senior partner at real estate adviser Bidwells, said it was an indication of the strength of interest in OxCam that global investors were attracted to the region despite the difficulties with planning and procurement.\n\n“The reality is that small policy changes are all it takes for this region to make an enormous difference to its contribution to national growth,” he added.\n\nThe government has said it is committed to investing in regional growth as part of its Industrial Strategy, although offering such high-profile backing to Oxford and Cambridge risks fuelling accusations that the south of England is being favoured in the push for growth.\n\nHowever, Dan Thorp, chief executive of advocacy group Cambridge Ahead, said backing OxCam was “not a zero-sum game” and Cambridge was working with other groups, such as the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, to create “connected clusters” that shared in growth.\n\n“The big bang benefit for the government’s growth mission can come from linking what happens in OxCam to the rest of the UK,” he added.",

    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "In the 20 years since she set up her chain of coffee shops, the business climate has never felt as difficult as it does now, according to Helena Hudson, whose Real Eating Company has 10 outlets in market towns and cathedral cities across south-east England.\n\nEven in prosperous areas, “people are still very much watching the pennies”, she said, leaving her little hope of offsetting a £127,000 rise in her tax bill in April through price rises alone. Nor can Hudson hold down wages, since a minimum-wage increase of 6.7 per cent will apply to many of her staff.\n\nSo she is cutting jobs: closing a café in London, making a long-standing manager redundant and asking part-timers to work longer hours or leave, since they will no longer fall below the threshold for employer national insurance contributions. “It’s not what we want to do,” Hudson said.\n\nBusinesses across the UK are making similarly uncomfortable choices as they calculate how best to respond to the tax and wage increases announced by Rachel Reeves in the October Budget.\n\nThe policies — which the chancellor said would help restore “stability to the public finances” and pay for public services — will sharply increase labour costs, particularly in low-wage sectors such as retail and hospitality.\n\nThe question the Bank of England must answer is whether a weaker jobs market will finally bring down wage growth — or whether stubborn pay pressures will persist, keeping inflation above the official 2 per cent target.\n\nThere is mounting evidence that employers have cut headcount in the wake of the Budget announcements, with official data showing payroll employment fell in November and December as vacancies kept sliding.\n\nSurvey data published on Friday suggested the share of businesses cutting staffing levels was higher in January than at any point since the 2008-09 financial crisis, except the pandemic period.\n\nLiz Martins, economist at HSBC, said the combination of a weaker economy, higher costs and new scope for artificial intelligence-related efficiencies felt “like a perfect storm” for the jobs market.\n\nLast week, retailer J Sainsbury said it was axing 3,000 jobs, from its head office to its in-store cafés, while an executive at Associated British Foods, owner of the low-cost fashion chain Primark, said people were starting to buy fewer clothes because of worries about job security.\n\nBut despite such retrenchment, wage growth has accelerated. Data last week showed private sector earnings grew at an annual pace of 6 per cent in the three months to November, excluding bonuses — double the 3 per cent pace the BoE thinks broadly consistent with the inflation target.\n\nOne contributing factor, highlighted in a recent trading statement by retailer Next, is that increases in the minimum wage have a lasting “ripple” effect on pay higher up the scale, as employers seek to maintain incentives for promotion to higher grades.\n\nAndrew Wishart, economist at Berenberg bank, described this situation as a “massive headache” for the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee, which is expected to cut interest rates from 4.75 per cent to 4.5 per cent when it next meets on February 6.\n\nHe said the minimum wage was “becoming a serious problem” because it prevented low-wage employers absorbing the £25bn NICs increase by holding down pay.\n\nYet even as they shed jobs, other businesses would still be able to pass on higher costs to consumers, keeping services price inflation above 4 per cent and pushing headline inflation above 3 per cent later this year.\n\nThe BoE, which watches services inflation closely, was still likely to lower interest rates in the short term in order to prevent a “horrible” outcome for workers, but it might need to stop cutting the cost of borrowing in the second half of the year, Wishart said.\n\nOther economists believe wage growth will slow over the course of the year, as companies will no longer fight to recruit higher-paid professionals who cannot wring a salary rise out of their current employer.\n\nMartins of HSBC said that trend was “in the past now”. While April’s changes might lead some companies to raise prices initially, she argued that all the other ways they might respond — replacing workers with AI, squeezing pay, cutting jobs or offshoring work — would eventually lower inflation.\n\nBut wage growth may not subside fast enough for the BoE’s comfort.\n\nFour-fifths of employers planned to make lower pay awards this year than in 2024, according to a poll conducted by analysts at Incomes Data Research and published on Monday. Most said the increase in NICs would make them less generous than they otherwise would have been.\n\nBut the survey found that more than half of employers who had not yet decided their award expected it to exceed 3 per cent. Where pay deals had been agreed, more than 40 per cent of employees were receiving 4 per cent or more.\n\n“All business surveys illustrate the same conundrum for the MPC. Payroll tax hikes, global uncertainty and tariff threats are driving inflation and output in opposite directions,” said Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThis meant that even with growth weak enough to warrant rate cuts, inflation remained strong enough to require caution, he added, noting that tax increases were affecting both jobs and prices more than rate-setters had expected, with little effect on wages.\n\nIf this remains the case, unemployment may need to rise further than previously thought for the BoE to keep inflation down.\n\n“Wage growth will take a little longer to come down than the BoE might like, but we think that remaining pressures are being driven by government policy, not a tighter labour market,” Martins said.",

    "body": "One in five UK-listed companies sounded the alarm on profits in 2024, underlining the impact of rising costs and businesses’ reluctance to commit to optional spending.\n\nA total of 19 per cent of London-listed companies issued profit warnings, the third highest proportion this century and exceeded only by the figures in 2001 and 2020 when the dotcom bust and pandemic hurt performance, according to a report published by EY-Parthenon on Monday.\n\nThe figures come after S&P Global survey data last week showed that UK businesses were cutting jobs at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe bulk of the 2024 profit warnings stemmed from companies’ reluctance to spend money buying goods and services from other businesses, according to EY-Parthenon.\n\n“We don’t expect a huge uptick in insolvency levels in 2025, but we are now seeing more distress, and more stakeholders viewing insolvency processes as a real option,” said Jo Robinson, head of turnaround and restructuring strategy for EY-Parthenon in the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe report found that 34 per cent of the warnings cited contract and order cancellations or delays as reasons for reduced profitability, up from about a quarter in 2023.\n\nThe companies worst hit included business service providers, industrial suppliers and recruitment companies — sectors vulnerable to corporate customers reducing their spending. Retailers and software and computer groups were also among the worst affected.\n\nA series of high-profile companies warned investors about plummeting profits last year, underlining the growing pressure on businesses. Those to issue warnings included Frasers Group, owner of UK retailer Sports Direct, and housebuilder Vistry, both of which were relegated from the FTSE 100 in December.\n\nBusinesses had shied away from recruitment costs and optional investment in 2024 amid “global geopolitical uncertainty and policy upheaval”, causing stress at businesses reliant on that spend, said Robinson.\n\nThe proportion of companies warning on profits rose slightly from 18.2 per cent in 2023.\n\nKirsten Tompkins, director at EY-Parthenon and author of the report, said the prevalence of the profit warnings was linked to over-optimism by companies’ management.\n\nCompanies kept expecting their performance to improve by relying too heavily on past performance, even though “in some markets you’ve seen really drastic [permanent] changes”, she said.\n\nThis raised questions about whether companies were adjusting their mindset to account for the level of volatility in the economy, Tompkins added.\n\nIncreasing costs triggered nearly one in five of the warnings last year.\n\nDespite the sustained pressure on their earnings in recent years, a ready supply of cheap, long-term debt and taxpayer-funded pandemic support had provided “breathing space” that helped many companies to avoid going bust, Robinson said.\n\nBut that could change with higher borrowing costs, particularly for companies that need to refinance over the next three years, she added. “More companies are now reaching a tipping point as cumulative pressures build.”",

    "blurb": "Pension consultants WTW says improved funding positions have made bulk annuity deals more attractive",
    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK businesses are set to offload a record £70bn of pension risk to insurers this year as healthy scheme funding levels support a flurry of dealmaking, according to a new forecast. Funding levels of defined benefit pension schemes have improved after higher government bond yields reduced the value of future liabilities. That has made bulk annuity deals, where companies sell their pension schemes to insurers who then take responsibility for meeting pension obligations, more attractive.\n\nCompanies have sought to hand over their pension liabilities to insurers because it means they no longer have to report the pension surpluses or deficits in their own accounts — or assist with any shortfall — while such deals have become an important source of revenue for insurers. Pension consultants WTW has forecast a combined £70bn in sales this year, made up of £50bn of bulk annuity transactions and £20bn in longevity swaps, where pension schemes insure against members living longer than expected, from just under £60bn in 2024.\n\nForecasts for a buoyant 2025 follow volumes that were slightly lower than predicted last year as some employers decided to keep their schemes or delay buyouts, in anticipation of higher surpluses.\n\nThe Conservative government last spring explored options to allow companies to access scheme surpluses, estimated to be worth more than £100bn on a low-risk measure, causing some well-funded schemes to run for longer in order to take advantage of the expected improved access.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to soon lay out plans to allow companies and scheme members to benefit more from surpluses in defined benefit schemes.\n\nShelly Beard, managing director in WTW’s pension transactions team, said funding levels had “generally continued to improve” over the past year, enabling companies with smaller schemes to transfer their pension obligations to an insurer.\n\nRoyal London and Utmost both completed their first bulk annuity transactions last year, bringing the total number of insurers operating in this market to 10. Last summer private capital giant Brookfield applied for a licence to operate as a UK insurer to enable it to make bulk annuity deals.\n\n“The defined benefit de-risking market is the envy of the global insurance world . . . [It is] bigger than any other, including the US,” said David Richardson, chief executive officer at Just Group, which completed 129 bulk purchase annuity transactions last year.\n\nMore than 35 per cent of the UK’s 4,900 DB pension schemes, which manage a combined £1.2tn of assets, are fully funded on a buyout basis, meaning they could afford to hand over their schemes to an insurer, according to the Pension Protection Fund, which was set up by the government to compensate pensioners if their employers’ scheme fails.\n\nBumper bulk annuity transactions have also attracted scrutiny from regulators, with the Prudential Regulation Authority earlier this month warning of the risk of funded reinsurance deals where UK life insurers pass some of their pension liabilities to overseas reinsurers.\n\nConcerns include whether, in the case of a reinsurer’s default, assets brought back to the books of UK insurers would be sufficient to cover their risks.\n\nCharlie Finch, partner at consultancy LCP, said his firm had been lobbying the PRA to give better disclosure on funded reinsurance as “a vacuum of information has made people worry more than they might need to”.",

    "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Donald Trump and Sir Keir Starmer “agreed to meet soon” in the course of a 45-minute phone call on Sunday, following a declaration by the US president that he liked the UK prime minister “a lot”.\n\nStarmer hopes to visit the White House soon, while Trump, who professed his “respect and affection” for the British royal family, said he may visit the UK on his first foreign trip since re-entering the White House.\n\nThe call, described as “a very good conversation” by one person briefed on its contents, has raised hopes in London that Trump could have a constructive relationship with Starmer, in spite of past tensions.\n\nA key feature was what was not discussed: those briefed on the call said there was no mention of potential tariffs on the UK or on Starmer’s choice of Lord Peter Mandelson as his ambassador to Washington.\n\nIn spite of criticism by Trump allies of Starmer’s plan to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in return for securing the long-term future of the US-UK Diego Garcia military base, that issue was not raised either.\n\nThe president’s reticence on all those questions has raised hopes in London that Britain may escape some of the hostile attention that Trump has so far reserved for the likes of Colombia, Mexico and the EU.\n\nAn official UK readout of the call said Starmer discussed with Trump, among other things, “how we are deregulating to boost growth”, a policy which chimes with the president’s war on red tape.\n\nStarmer’s plan to streamline planning and to curtail judicial reviews also came up. Trump has been involved in his own wrangles with environmentalists over his Aberdeenshire golf resort.\n\nDowning Street said Starmer also praised Trump for his “role in securing the landmark ceasefire and hostages deal in Gaza” between Israel and Hamas. The two leaders “agreed to meet soon and looked forward to further discussions then”, Number 10 added.\n\nThe White House readout of the call said Trump and Starmer discussed “how both countries can promote a fair bilateral economic relationship”.\n\nSpeaking before the call, Trump told the BBC on Air Force One he had a good rapport with Starmer. “I get along with him well. I like him a lot,” he said.\n\n“He’s liberal, which is a bit different from me, but I think he’s a very good person and I think he’s done a very good job thus far. I may not agree with his philosophy, but I have a very good relationship with him.”\n\nTrump met Starmer for dinner last September at Trump Tower in New York, in what was seen by both sides as a positive encounter.\n\nThe expectation in London is that Trump will not oppose the appointment of Mandelson as Britain’s new ambassador to Washington. The former UK minister is due to start in the post next month.\n\nAllies of Starmer also hope Trump will not block the contentious Chagos Islands deal. “It hasn’t been number one on my list, I’ll be honest with you,” the president told reporters.\n\nAsked where he might go for the first international trip of his second White House term, Trump said: “It could be Saudi Arabia, it could be UK. Traditionally it could be UK.\n\n“Last time I went to Saudi Arabia because they agreed to buy $450bn of US merchandise.”\n\nA meeting with Britain’s royals would appeal to Trump and is seen in Downing Street as a key selling point to the president. No dates have yet been set for the mutual visits.\n\nStarmer this month told the Financial Times in Kyiv he had a “constructive” relationship with Trump, in spite of numerous criticisms of the president by Labour ministers in the past.\n\nTrump railed against the involvement of Labour staffers in Kamala Harris’s unsuccessful presidential campaign. Technology billionaire Elon Musk, named by Trump as a “waste-buster” in his new administration, has called Starmer “tyrannical”.\n\nDavid Lammy, UK foreign secretary, previously called Trump “a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath”. Lammy has said the two patched up relations in the Trump Tower dinner in September.Trump’s positive comments about Starmer contrast with those he has made since his inauguration about countries including Canada and Denmark.\n\nOn Sunday Trump imposed tariffs and sanctions on Colombia after it declined entry to US military flights carrying deported migrants.\n\nJonathan Reynolds, UK trade secretary, has argued that Britain should not be hit by tariffs, given that trade between the UK and US is mainly services-based and is broadly balanced.",

    "blurb": "Ministers set to allow companies to access defined benefit scheme surpluses to help kick-start growth",
    "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is looking to free up billions of pounds from the UK’s £1.2tn defined benefit pension system in her latest attempt to kick-start growth.\n\nThe government is preparing to allow companies to access scheme surpluses — estimated to be worth around £100bn — to encourage them to invest in more risky assets, according to people briefed on the chancellor’s thinking.\n\n“The devil is in the detail but we are positively inclined,” said one government insider.\n\nThe Treasury declined to comment on the discussions — first reported by Sky News — but City sources said Varun Chandra, Sir Keir Starmer’s top business adviser, had discussed the possibility of using so-called surplus to boost the economy.\n\nA shift in focus to DB schemes comes as the chancellor is gearing up for her growth speech on Wednesday. Pension experts estimate allowing companies to access scheme surpluses could unlock up to £100bn for investment.\n\nThe government had previously focused its pensions review on consolidating defined contribution (DC) and local authority pension assets. A review into pensions adequacy, which the government had hoped would drive more investment into the UK, has been delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times in November, former pensions minister Emma Reynolds said she had prioritised reforming DC workplace schemes because that was “where the growth is”.\n\nShe pointed out the majority of corporate DB pension schemes were closed to new members and “naturally had a less long time frame” as schemes move into less risky assets as they wind down or sell their pension obligations to an insurance company.\n\nHowever, industry insiders said a radical improvement in the funding position of DB pension schemes in recent years following a rise in government bond yields meant many were now in a position to take on more risk, if the rules enabled companies and scheme members to benefit from it.\n\n“The reason the government announcements have been about DC and the Local Government Pension Scheme is because they’ve not really understood DB and think it’s too big to touch . . . but the implications of not touching it are worse for the government and I think they realise it now,” said the chair of a multibillion pound DB pension scheme.\n\nDavid Lane, chief executive officer at TPT Retirement Solutions, which manages DB and DC pensions, said allowing companies to access scheme surpluses was “likely to be a more effective way of channelling pension assets in to the UK economy than some of the consolidation initiatives that have been announced . . . it’s direct if the employer reinvests that money into its business”.\n\nAccess to scheme surpluses could slow the pace at which pension funds have been offloading their pension obligations to insurance companies, with around £50bn of assets transferred in so-called bulk annuity transactions in each of the past two years, according to pensions consultancy WTW.\n\nHalting this trend could help support UK government bond and equity markets in the longer term because insurance companies typically sell gilts and invest in higher-yielding corporate bonds — many of which are overseas — as well as infrastructure to make their profits.\n\nZoe Alexander, director of the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association trade group, said she backed surplus release, with the right protections in place to ensure member benefits are secure.\n\n“Lowering the legislative threshold for allowing returns of surplus could potentially encourage trustees (in conjunction with their employers) to adopt a more ambitious mindset and take on slightly riskier investment strategies for their DB assets, including greater investment in UK assets,” she said.",

    "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Welcome readers. I’m backpacking in Vietnam and Laos this week, so I’ve prepared something slightly different.\n\nAs readers know, the aim of Free Lunch on Sunday is to present analysis that counters conventional wisdom. For each piece, this often involves discussing positions with economists and market strategists that are not necessarily their house view.\n\nSo for this edition, rather than the usual synthesis of my findings, I wanted to share more of what the analysts told me. I asked experts to sketch out a bullish scenario for the British economy over the next decade, and what it would take to get there. Here’s what they said.\n\nFirst, the global backdrop. Labour’s large parliamentary majority means the UK now stands out for its (relative) stability. France has an unstable coalition and Germany faces an election in February. Political views in the EU are splintering. In the US, President Donald Trump appears more interested in fomenting uncertainty.\n\nAs for trade disruption, Britain’s specialism in services — and position outside the EU — puts it less in the line of fire of Trump’s tariff plans. The US president is more focused on the trade in goods, particularly with China and the European trading bloc.\n\nLabour has already eaten into this “stability dividend” by lumbering companies with high taxes in its autumn Budget. Still, Marko Papic, chief strategist at BCA Research, reckons that the autonomy Britain has from being less restrained by internal politics and trade wars could be a boon:\n\nBuilding on this advantage would require a targeted approach to striking agreements. Deals on the trade in services could allow Britain to export its comparative advantage in high-value services further and wider. And reducing the red tape involved in trading with the EU, the UK’s largest trading partner, would boost supply chains.\n\nLess Trump exposure is also why some of Wall Street’s biggest institutions are betting that UK equities will outpace the rest of Europe’s this year. They believe banks and energy companies — which have large weightings on the London Stock Exchange — could experience a boost from Trump’s deregulation and pro-oil policies. Low valuations also look attractive.\n\nBut British stocks will still need a catalyst to drive equity values up. I asked Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, where it may come from:\n\nIndeed, Britain ranks third in Capital Economics’ index of advanced economies best-placed to benefit from AI adoption, given its large services sector and flexible labour market.\n\nEfforts to unshackle Britain’s vast pension capital — the largest in Europe — could support more investment in public and private equities, both at home and abroad. But Gimber suggests there are better levers to pull:\n\nA few studies suggest slashing stamp duty on shares could raise revenues in the long term by boosting growth.\n\nAnd with tight public finances, “removing hurdles” is where Sam Dumitriu, head of policy at Britain Remade, thinks the UK can get the biggest bang for its buck.\n\nLabour’s Planning and Infrastructure Bill is expected in the coming months. If it can streamline regulations, speed up approvals and clear more land for development, investment could jump.\n\nThe government’s industrial strategy, due to be published this spring, is set to unveil opportunities to crowd-in private investment into key infrastructure projects. It is also supposed to outline plans to boost Britain’s existing strengths in high-demand growth sectors. These include financial and professional services, university research and education, renewables (wind, carbon capture and storage), life sciences, aerospace technology, artificial intelligence and creative industries. (Less red tape, wider investment incentives and improved access to training and high-skilled talent would all help.)\n\nThat Britain does these complex things pretty well, but struggles with simpler tasks, is a reason to be optimistic, adds Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt.\n\nIndeed, until the past couple of years, Britain struggled with political stability. Now that it has some, investment has returned. Add a few bespoke trade deals, a plan to strengthen its comparative advantages and planning reforms — and things can only get better.\n\nDumitriu added: “If we stay good at what we’re good at and get less bad at what we’re very bad at, then the next decade could be a very good one for Britain.”\n\nThoughts? Rebuttals? Message me at freelunch@ft.com or on X @tejparikh90.\n\nGreenland is in the spotlight. Trump wants to buy the icy island for its apparent treasure trove of rare earth metals. But the Danish territory’s accessible riches may not be all they’ve been made out to be. America could be better off mining for minerals at home.",

    "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Affluent Britons are increasingly gifting money to family members as concerns mount that Rachel Reeves could make the inheritance tax regime more punitive, according to wealth managers.\n\nTax advisers told the Financial Times they had seen an increase in gifting and enquiries about mitigating death duties since before the October Budget, when the chancellor set out plans to levy inheritance tax on pensions and agricultural land.\n\nReeves last month ruled out an emergency spring Budget. But some analysts and advisers have warned that she could cast the inheritance tax net even wider in a bid to shore up the government’s fiscal plans.\n\nThe fears have prompted more people to gift money under the current regime, which does not apply IHT at 40 per cent to gifts unless the benefactor dies within seven years.\n\n“The seven year rule is now up for grabs, that seems to be the next target,” said Nimesh Shah, chief executive of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg. “You could widen it to 10 years. Inheritance tax is now at the fore of concerns.”\n\nOlly Cheng, financial planning director at Rathbones, said the wealth manager was “seeing a lot of concern about where the government will target next” after its measures targeting pensions and farmers.\n\n“There is a feeling among a lot of people that there will need to be more tax increases to balance the books, and the consequence of this uncertainty is that people are bringing forward gifts that might have been made later,” he added.\n\nConcerns about increased IHT come even as the government’s receipts from the levy continue to climb, with HM Revenue & Customs, the tax authority, collecting £6.3bn between April and December 2024.\n\nThe government raises less than 1 per cent of total revenue from death duties, but Reeves’ pledge during the general election last year not to increase rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT has left her little wriggle room to raise revenue.\n\nThis week Reeves signalled a softening of tax reforms for wealthy non-doms following warnings that her proposals were driving people to leave Britain. But Shah said the changes would “have no impact on the direction of IHT”.\n\nWealth managers said that many more of their clients faced the prospect of their estates falling within the scope of IHT over the next decade, with some attributing the increase in gifting to the changes to HMRC’s treatment of pensions and agricultural land.\n\nUnused pension pots will be included in estates from April 2027 and subject to the standard 40 per cent IHT rate. Meanwhile, landowners will from April 2026 be subject to a 20 per cent levy on agricultural land above a threshold of between £1.3mn and £3mn, depending on whether they are married and if they own a home.\n\nEmma Sterland, chief financial planning director at Evelyn Partners, said the reforms to pensions and land taxation were behind a rise in “clients thinking about making financial gifts to their families”, with the Budget evidence that IHT was “in the Treasury’s crosshairs”.\n\nIan Cook, a chartered financial planner at Quilter Cheviot, said he was encouraging clients to “consider gifting more strategically” in view of the upcoming pensions taxation reforms after more had begun “exploring ways to pass on wealth during their lifetime”.\n\nThe Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "Harland & Wolf suppliers owed millions of pounds fear they will not be paid as the bankrupt shipbuilder is taken over by Spain’s Navantia, warning of a hit to UK supply chains if they are replaced by European contractors.\n\nThe 164-year-old company best known for building the Titanic fell into administration last September, hobbled by large losses and steep interest payments on its debt.\n\nA deal was struck in December with state-owned Navantia which the UK government vowed would protect 1,000 jobs at H & W’s four yards in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland.\n\nBut suppliers say jobs are already being lost in the supply chain and they have little prospect of getting their invoices paid.\n\nRussell Downs, the bankruptcy and restructuring expert brought in as interim executive chair in July, told the Financial Times in December the sale to Navantia “regrettably” would mean losses for creditors and suppliers.\n\nOn January 14, the four yards that had been continuing to operate followed the parent company into administration.\n\n“It’s very stressful,” said the chief executive of one British-based supplier who, like others, asked not to be named. “They owe us £10mn plus, a reasonably big chunk of our business . . . We’re an SME. That kind of money does have an effect.”\n\nHe added: “Until just before Christmas, the assumption was that H & W would be sold as a going concern and Navantia were going to stand behind its debt . . . Looking ahead, I would imagine Navantia are going to use their own suppliers now — they’re not going to want to take liabilities.”\n\nTan Dhesi, chair of the defence select committee at Westminster, asked John Healey, UK defence secretary, in a letter last week for “comprehensive answers” by February 3 on how government is helping H & W’s supply chain.\n\n“The immediate effects on the UK supply chain and employment landscape are huge,” said the head of one company supplying H & W’s Appledore yard in England and Belfast.\n\n“There’s a lot of angry local people and not much support from anybody,” said a supplier of services in Belfast, who said his company and clients were owed £22mn.\n\n“It’s a horrible situation . . . It’s a bit like David and Goliath,” he said. “It’s been cloak and dagger the whole way through . . . Basically, the rug has been pulled. The headlines are saying they’re saving jobs. I know [supply chain] companies have already started laying people off.”\n\nNavantia understands suppliers’ concerns and is committed to developing H & W’s capabilities and “supporting the local industry,” said one person familiar with the company’s plans. It aims to “redevelop a healthy industrial ecosystem in order to support their [suppliers’] viability,” the person said.\n\nThe sale to Navantia is expected to close on Monday. Staff were told in an email last week seen by the FT that “the next chapter in the shipyard’s history is about to begin”, with Navantia bringing “the experience, stability and investment that is desperately needed”.\n\nThe Belfast and Appledore supplier said the so-called prepack sale was “being used as a means to write off debt at the expense of the trade creditors” which are mainly SMEs.\n\nThe UK government and Navantia have refused to disclose financial details, including the size of what Jonathan Reynolds, business and trade secretary, said was a “relatively minor” increase to the £1.6bn contract to build three Royal Navy support vessels in which Navantia and H & W are partners. Navantia had pushed for a boost to clinch the deal.\n\nA government spokesperson said it “has not given any direct financial support to Navantia” and the deal contained “the minimum changes to the contract necessary — on commercial terms — to ensure its continued delivery”.\n\nHilary Benn, the UK’s Northern Ireland secretary, on January 15 blamed unpaid invoices to suppliers on “the failure of the old H & W”.\n\n“It now falls to Navantia to decide which of the invoices it wishes to pay, but it will want to secure a relationship with suppliers contributing to the fleet solid support ship programme,” he said.",

    "body": "Three of England’s most senior judges are set to hear a legal challenge brought by businesses that were forced to close during the pandemic over whether insurance companies can deduct furlough funds from payouts under business interruption policies.\n\nLawyers said hundreds of millions of pounds were at stake in the precedent-setting case, which is the latest front in a broader legal battle over insurance coverage for businesses during the pandemic.\n\nThe Court of Appeal is due this week to hear the dispute about whether insurers are right to deduct government furlough funds — subsidies paid to businesses during lockdowns to cover wages and prevent mass redundancies — when they calculate the insurance payouts.\n\nInsurers Liberty Mutual, Allianz and Aviva have argued that they are entitled to subtract the furlough payments. But businesses bringing the legal challenge, which include Starboard Hotels and Arena Racing, owner of racecourses such as Chepstow and Bath, said the furlough funds were not designed to subsidise the insurance industry.\n\n“It shouldn’t be the insurers that end up being the ultimate beneficiaries” of furlough, said Aaron Le Marquer, partner at law firm Stewarts, which represents Arena Racing.\n\nThe UK government launched its furlough scheme at the height of the pandemic in 2020. It allowed for staff to be paid 80 per cent of their salary or wage up to a cap of £2,500 a month.\n\nPayments were made to 1.3mn employers, costing the government about £70bn.\n\nIn a judgment last year, the High Court found that insurers were permitted to take furlough payments into account when calculating insurance payouts.\n\nHowever, the judge, Mr Justice Jacobs, granted policyholders permission to appeal on the grounds that it was an “important marketwide issue”.\n\nThe case before the Court of Appeal is due to be heard on Tuesday and Wednesday by Lord Justice Popplewell, Lord Justice Phillips and Sir Julian Flaux, chancellor of the High Court.\n\nLawyers for the claimants said the furlough dispute arose in “many thousands” of other business interruption claims beyond those of the claimants.\n\nIn a letter to the Association of British Insurers in 2020, the Treasury wrote that it expected “that grant funds intended to provide emergency support to businesses at this time of crisis are not to be deducted from business interruption insurance claims”.\n\nLiberty Mutual, Allianz, Aviva and the UK government declined to comment.",

    "blurb": "Political interference fuels uncertainty for businesses in need of a stable competition policy",
    "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0",
    "body": "If talking about growth delivered it, Britain would be supersized. But the cash-strapped, tax-raising government is still scratching around for ideas that can make a difference. Its abrupt replacement of the chair of the antitrust regulator last week gives the impression that a looser approach to competition enforcement is in its sights. It is not a good look.\n\nForcing out Marcus Bokkerink, the chair of the UK Competition and Markets Authority, might be intended to send a message about Britain’s openness to investment. Complaints that it was closed for business were hurled around in 2023 when, unlike peers, the watchdog initially blocked Microsoft’s takeover of the gaming developer Activision Blizzard.\n\nAfter a modified version of the deal was approved, Microsoft described the CMA as “tough and fair”. Even so, the government is doubtless anxious to hear fewer complaints from potential investors about the regulator. The return to power of a US president intent on defending American interests abroad is another salient factor. The EU is wondering whether to adjust or scale back its own tech probes.\n\nSir Keir Starmer’s government may want to go no further than a symbolic change of leadership and rhetorical flourishes about “supercharging” the economy with pro-business decisions. If it does want to consider changes to competition policy it would not be alone. A new team of US trustbusters is expected to relax the tough approach to dealmaking imposed under Joe Biden, though a return to traditionally conservative antitrust policies is not guaranteed.\n\nIn Europe, former European Central Bank governor Mario Draghi argued that domestic champions should be allowed to bulk up to compete with Chinese and US giants in last year’s blockbuster report on EU competitiveness. He favoured consolidation in the telecoms sector to give companies the muscle to invest, although sceptics say there is little evidence that telecoms mergers boost investment.\n\nThe CMA is well aware of the trade-offs. It noted that intense competition can be detrimental to innovation, in research published earlier this month. Last year it gave the green light to the Vodafone-Three UK joint venture, on condition it committed to certain infrastructure investments. It has also signalled a willingness to approve mergers on the basis of behavioural, rather than structural, remedies.\n\nOverall, it is hard to argue the CMA takes an overly aggressive approach. The number of mergers it investigates that are rejected or abandoned is small and falling. The UK has seen a modest weakening of competition, measured by cost mark-ups, over the past 25 years.\n\nMinisters should avoid giving the impression they want to influence competition decisions. Keeping powerful incumbents in check can help other businesses flourish. Antitrust enforcement is generally a spur, not an impediment, to growth and productivity gains. Moreover, competition policy should be stable and predictable. Political interference fuels uncertainty, and there is little that businesses hate more.\n\nvanessa.houlder@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nWorld of profitable exits and killer acquisitions / From Simon Holmes, Visiting Professor in Law, University of Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK",

    "body": "“We wanted to create an enfilade and I should use that word sparingly for want of sounding pretentious, but it’s like creating streams so you get the width, depth and full use of the spaces,” smiles architect John McAslan describing the masterplan behind the renovation of his Victorian home in south-west London. “It really is a pull of energy, to move you through from the front door to the garden,” adds his wife, Dava Sagenkahn, dressed in vibrant Issey Miyake Pleats Please.\n\nThe journey – or enfilade – through the McAslan home, situated on a leafy, residential street, begins at a knee-height bespoke wooden gate. This unusual design is the initial welcome into the expansive, expressive interior that lies beyond the front door.\n\nThe hallway, with original geometric period tiling, features an oblique, narrow glass window that frames an olive tree planted in an external side return. On the left, it bursts open into a living area, and straight ahead segues into a big kitchen that swings out perpendicularly into a dining area with a vast Vitra table. A wall of sliding glass garden doors filters light across the entire ground floor.\n\nScotsman McAslan, who founded John McAslan+ Partners in 1993, is a pioneer of intervention and preservation – an architectural approach that favours repurposing (rather than demolishing) old buildings. His multi-award-winning practice is behind some of the most impressive transport hubs in the world including King’s Cross Station, Sydney Metro’s Central Station, the upgrade of Penn Station in New York and Bond Street station on the  Elizabeth Line, alongside residential towers, education centres and museums such as the revamped The Burrell Collection in his home city of Glasgow. While different, each project is underpinned by human-centric architecture that improves the quality of urban life.\n\nWhen it came to conceiving this house, the McAslans were not interested in statement-making grandeur but in creating a beautiful environment in which to live, love, think and work. For John, the methodology is the same. “It was about transforming the old into new, which is what a lot of the work of the practice is about. We wanted to open it up, retain what we could, set a budget and develop a language of architecture and design that was an expression of us,” he says. “The central idea here was to get the energy of the house circulating front to back and retain, remodel and upcycle what existed to varying degrees – we had an ecological, fabric-first approach.”\n\nSince the early 1980s, the couple lived in four different properties in Notting Hill. As John was building his business, Dava was working in recruitment while raising three children, Hannah, Flossy and Renwick, who have now all left home. There was no urgency to move, rather a gentle yearning for more light, sky and a sense of expansiveness, which is hard to find in the densely occupied city.\n\nMoving south of the river was not on the agenda until their daughter Hannah, a lawyer who lives in the area, spotted the property and went for a recce, iPhone in hand. She sent the video to John and Dava who were on holiday at their restored farm south of Florence. They swiftly put in an offer. “We’ve never done that before. We’re normally forensic,” laughs Dava of the almost blind bid and the serendipitous events that landed them the keys.\n\nThe core renovation with the construction company Davies & Daughters involved knocking down walls, opening up all the spaces, building out into the garden and ripping out a “circus tent” conservatory. “It was an awful octagonal makeshift ’70s one – boiling in the summer and leaky in the rain,” says John, rolling his intense blue eyes. It was reconfigured into a punched-out space that now frames a small kidney-shaped garden landscaped by Jack Newlyn and enclaved by bamboo and neighbouring trees.\n\nThe first floor hosts John and Dava’s bedroom, a private sitting room and an emerald-Bisazza-tiled en suite bathroom with a curvilinear wall. The top floor houses two super-size flexible sleep-living spaces for guests and family, with extended eaves that create new volumes and light. The upstairs bathrooms are vivid lime green “cubes” with a painted floor, ceiling and wall in the same wake-me-up hue. “The layout of the house is clear and direct, with flexibility: the ground floor is entirely open, engaging the hall, reception spaces, extended kitchen, garden room and fully opening into and through the garden,” says John, who admits he has an aversion to rooms with closed doors. “The first floor is our apartment, and the top floor is a suite of connected spaces that can open or close as needs be.” “I feel I can use every room,” says Dava. “There are times when I take my laptop and go all the way up to the top of the house and it’s just great.”\n\nThere were a few trouble spots, including a damp, rotting cellar that required gutting and fixing to make way for a utility area. “How we avoided electrocution, I don’t know!” says Dava of the early renovation. They moved in permanently in March 2024. Perhaps unusually, the couple were aligned on pretty much all aspects, including the wood-panelled walls and simple single strips of shelving (by John Cherrington of Windmill Furniture) that feature throughout. The Strong White (Farrow & Ball) wall paint changes with the light, accented by breezy voile curtains, citrus-green blinds (that beam optimism from the street view) and the wide oak floorboards.\n\nThe couple first met in the late 1970s in Boston at the canteen of the architectural practice Cambridge Seven Associates, where John had just landed an internship as a recent graduate from Edinburgh University. Dava was working as an executive assistant to one of the partners. It was a coup de foudre. “I said to myself, well, I’m going to marry her. This was she! So I stayed my year and I think on the last day I asked you out or something,” smiles John, who returned to London to work at Richard Rogers and rack up a phone bill calling his sweetheart. A transatlantic courtship ensued before Dava moved to the UK in 1981 and they wed. “Not really knowing each other, but enough to know,” laughs Dava. “This was not anything I ever planned when I was burning my bra with my feminist sisters: a, to get married; or b, to marry someone I didn’t know very well.”\n\nThe couple share a love of adventure, travel, family and collecting that is writ large in their collection of furniture, art and artefacts. The cane and teak furniture is a combination of original armchairs designed by Pierre Jeanneret for Chandigarh in the 1950s, with a number of pieces recently made by Phillips Antiques in India in reclaimed teak. The wooden screens by Artek were designed by Alvar Aalto in 1936, and they own a standout Brazilian petal table by Jorge Zalszupin from the 1960s. “We dressed the interiors with an array of panelled wall assemblies – some open and some closed – for our library. The artefacts, collected over time and very personal to us, express our journey individually and as a family,” says Dava.\n\nThere is a luminescent collection of Bakelite pieces (many found in Martha’s Vineyard) perched on cabinets; a vintage Missoni rug alongside colourful abstract floor coverings, some sketched by John and handwoven by Shyam Ahuja in Mumbai. The artworks, casually leaning on the narrow shelves and coursing up the stairwells, range from an exquisite sketch of two female bottoms by their daughter Flossy (John swears it is better than Klimt) to contemporary Indian abstract painters, and a very early American 1869 Shield, Eagle and Flags stamp (one of a series purchased for their children) to celebrate Dava’s US roots.\n\nBy contrast, there are photographic works by the Indian artist Raghu Rai, alongside Wolfgang Tillmans and Simon Starling. The couple are patrons of emerging artists and the collection is diverse, esoteric and autobiographical – with many humorous anecdotes attached. “We began collecting around 40 years ago when we first married, starting with Peter Blake’s pencil studies of a lady’s bottom made in 1955 when he was a student at the RCA. From there we focused on European expressionists like Paul Klee, Jean Metzinger, Erich Mendelsohn, Marc Chagall, Sonia Delaunay and Giorgio Morandi,” says John. They also share a love of abstract Indian painters including Ram Kumar, Tyeb Mehta and Francis Newton Souza – a founding member of the Progressive Artists’ Group.\n\nThe duo are strong believers in community and in preservation. In 2010, they fundraised £3.5mn with the local community in Argyll to save Dunoon Burgh Hall, an 1874 arts venue in the seaside town of Dunoon, where John grew up. The building was in danger of being torn down, so they bought it for £1. It is now a thriving cultural hub and there are plans to establish a library and archive centre with their vast collection (around 2,500) of architectural and art books. McAslan is also lobbying the GLA and central government as part of a Social and Affordable Housing Initiative calling for the adaptive reuse of redundant “grey belt” office space (estimated at 24mn sq ft) as a sustainable alternative to the push for new-build homes.\n\nOne of the biggest eye-openers for John is the newfound joy of crossing the Thames en route to work. “I think of the Kinks and ‘Waterloo Sunset’, romantic meetings and all that stuff. But the big change is having that distance between work and home,” he says. Not to mention the novelty of using the Overground and Underground. “When he first got on the train, we thought he might not come back!” says Dava. But now both have the pleasure of coming home through an elegant front gate. Four neighbours have already inquired after its provenance. “It is our gate!” they laugh in unison.",

    "body": "The writer is an author of fiction, cookery books and poetry anthologies. Her latest book is ‘The Dinner Table’, a collection of food writing\n\nIf you will forgive the Victoriana kitsch opening: spare a thought for the humble chimney sweep. Not only frozen in the public imagination as a Dickens-y grimy child, the chimney sweeps of Brighton and Hove now suffer a greater practical indignity: being asked to park their vans several streets away from their intended address, and approach on foot with all their gear, that their chimney-owning employers should be shielded from the wrath of eco-friendly neighbours.\n\nA “Cosy Killer” campaign haunts the streets of Kemptown: Brighton council seeks to invoke the spectre of innumerable pollutants in the fight against wood-fired stoves and open fires. It feels like a particularly bruising battle on both sides: impossible not to root for better air quality, but equally impossible not to understand that the days are short and the nights are wild, and the rush of a real wood fire feels like the only thing that might see you through to spring. A friend’s toddler daughter, having never seen a real fire, caught a glimpse of Netflix’s Fireplace For Your Home: Crackling Birchwood Fireplace. She ran off, fetched her little chair, and pulled it up close to the screen: totally transfixed. We stole it from the gods for a reason, and — Brighton council might say — they kept it from us for a reason, too.\n\nFire is always dangerous, one way or another, and the only difference between the fire we want (cosy, contained) and the fire we fear (house-consuming) is the chimney sweep. The chimney sweep, however far away you make him park, knows things you don’t know about fire; about smoke; and how thin a line there is between civilisation and what simmers beneath.\n\nIt’s funny that it’s taken this long for chimney sweeps to dip into the stigma associated with all the other ways wildness takes over a home: nobody likes to have the exterminator parked outside; nobody wants the neighbours to know they’ve had to call pest control. What if they think their mice came from inside our walls? I have, as a long-term city dweller, had to call both bedbug man and pest control in my time: bedbug man mutely fogged our home, white-suited and booted, while we took our shame out of town for the weekend.\n\nThe mouse man was a different — and wiser — story. He looked like something out of a Roald Dahl book: small, bright-eyed, and with a large, silent son in tow. “Fourth generation!” The son nodded. “He’s learning the trade,” he said. The son nodded. “Tell the ladies how a rat ran up your arm last week, Stephen!” Stephen mutely held out an arm. The mouse man beamed with pride. “When I was his age, I thought I’d be the world’s first no-kill mouse man,” he said, tucking little square boxes of poison into the kitchen corners. “Tried everything. Can’t be done! You have to fight with everything you’ve got.”\n\nHe was in his heart, he confessed, a photographer. Mainly of flowers, but other botanicals also. Some animals. He showed us the pictures on his phone. They were lovely. “But you can’t quit a job like this. The mice always come back.” He looked thoughtfully around our flat. “My dad did this one. So did granddad. Stephen’ll do it in 10, 20 years.” This exact house? This exact house.\n\n“We just keep fighting with everything we’ve got,” said the mouse man, cheerfully. “You done them boxes, Stephen?” Stephen nodded. Then, to us: “Did you follow my Instagram?” We nodded. “Best get on,” said the mouse man. “Lots to do!” Off he went, his son at his heels, following in the footsteps of his forefathers.\n\nAs we all do, if you think of it in primeval terms. More ancient than the Victorian chimney sweep, we can’t get away from the stuff that goes deep: the desire for fire, the fight against the wild, and the hope that nobody will cast us out, with our shame, into the darkness ourselves.",

    "body": "Drugmakers are growing frustrated with the NHS after a clawback tax unexpectedly soared, with pharmaceutical companies warning that investment in the UK may be at risk.\n\nThe industry association’s chief executive and board met with health secretary Wes Streeting last week to complain about having to pay 22.9 per cent of their UK sales back to the government this year, far more than the 15 per cent predicted.\n\nThe tax rate changes annually and the new rate surprised drugmakers when it was published late last year, after they had made their budgets for this year.\n\nIn 2024, the rebate tax was 15.1 per cent, and the year before that, under the previous agreement between the health department and the industry, it was 26.5 per cent.\n\nNHS England said purchases of potentially curative cell and gene therapies, and medicines for conditions including cancer, diabetes, eye diseases rose more than expected in 2024, which led to the rise in the tax rate.\n\nRichard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said he would like to review the deal, as the UK lags behind other European countries in what it pays for drugs, putting it in a “very very difficult position” if it wants to grow its life sciences industry.\n\n“There comes a point where the NHS has to be at least in the ballpark of being a good customer. Not necessarily the best in the world, but it is really hard if the NHS is the worst,” he said.\n\n“We can only continue to add billions to GDP in this country and create more medicines for the future if we make sure the system is working well for life sciences,” Torbett added.\n\nOne senior figure at a major pharmaceutical company said the impasse was already making the company reconsider investment in clinical trials and the launch of new drugs in the UK.\n\nThe person warned that the higher rate of taxation would challenge Streeting’s goal of positioning health as a “growth department”, adding that it sent a “‘do not invest here” sign to life sciences.\n\nFiona Bride, interim chief commercial officer at NHS England, said the voluntary scheme for branded medicines pricing and access had been a “triple win” for patients, taxpayers, and the life sciences sector.\n\nShe added that the higher rate showed the deal is working as intended because it is delivering more new medicines to patients. Estimated sales of new drugs rose from £7.8bn in 2023 to £8.9bn in 2024.\n\n“The NHS is delivering more newer branded drugs to patients as companies have brought forward new innovative treatments at cost effective prices,” she said.\n\nThe UK is home to world-leading scientific research, particularly in the ‘Golden Triangle’ of Oxford, Cambridge and London, and large pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and GSK.\n\nBut efforts to encourage the life sciences industry to grow have faltered because of concerns over the NHS not adopting new medicines quickly enough and paying less than other countries.\n\nGermany charges the industry a similar clawback tax but recently lowered it to 7 per cent of sales and Ireland’s tax is 9 per cent.\n\nAfter months of tense negotiations in 2023, the pharmaceutical industry and the government reached an agreement on a five-year deal on pricing.\n\nThe senior figure at a pharmaceutical group said that when the tax deals were signed last year, only the Department of Health was able to provide modelling, and the scenarios presented to pharmaceutical companies were “misleading”.\n\nThey added that pharmaceutical groups were frustrated because the NHS had received its biggest cash injection in decades in the Autumn Budget. “A massive budget increase has been given with zero added to the medicines budget,” they said.\n\n“The pharma industry are really pissed off,” said one person familiar with the matter.\n\nMark Dayan, head of public affairs at the think-tank the Nuffield Trust, said the agreement was based on the principle of variable rates based on sales trends for newer medicines.\n\n“This provides an element of predictability and control over the medicines bill and in all four countries of the UK, the NHS budget is extremely tight, often with overspends, so it will be a difficult conversation to think about reopening that deal so soon after it was signed,” he said.\n\nBut he said this rise is close to the clawback rates seen in the last year of the old deal, which were hitting up against the limits of what was acceptable to pharma companies.\n\nThe Department of Health said the pharmaceutical sector plays a vital role supporting the NHS and boosting UK growth: “We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with companies to tackle these together wherever we can”.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nUK pharma groups try to have their cake and eat it / From Mark Samuels, Chief Executive, British Generic Manufacturers Association, London EC2, UK",

    "date": "2025-01-2500:00:00.0",
    "body": "The writer is the UK’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation\n\nThe case of the Southport killer Axel Rudakubana raises urgent questions about how the law should apply to users of extreme violence for its own sake. Various arguments have been made in favour of amending the terrorism definition.\n\nFirst, it might be an appropriate label because only “terrorism” captures the social revulsion at Rudakubana’s acts of violence. Second, it might help prevention, pulling in the superior resources and capabilities of the UK counter-terrorism apparatus.\n\nThird would be a legal function, possibly unlocking greater investigative powers and widening the net of criminal liability to allow police intervention and prosecution before an attack can occur. For example, a lone actor who takes early steps to a mass slaughter commits an offence — but only if it is defined as terrorism. Each argument merits real consideration but each has drawbacks, quite possibly terminal.\n\nIf the present definition of terrorism is thought to be too narrow because it does not apply to extreme violence for its own sake, a new test will be needed to distinguish between it and ordinary crime. The current test — which requires a motive of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause — tackles attempts to change our way of life through violence. Terrorism without subversion is a very different proposition, but the current definition is still wider than it seems. It does apply to new, internet-driven ideologies that justify ultraviolence, even though they may be unfamiliar and therefore harder to spot, such as end-of-days anti-system dogma, and certain variants of Satanism and “incel”-related beliefs.\n\nSir Keir Starmer this week floated the possibility of a new test: “violence clearly intended to terrorise”. This risks too many false positives, such as domestic violence, unless the intended target is clearly the wider public not the immediate victim. Even this would still catch extortion by criminal gangs and serious hooliganism. The prime minister is, however, right about factoring in desire for notoriety, a major motivator in US school massacres.\n\nAs to resources, a wider definition will not automatically focus counter-terror police and MI5 manpower on future Southports. The national security apparatus has major threats to manage, including Isis-K and Russian sabotage. Unless the amendment was very tight, the system could be overwhelmed with dangerous and apparently dangerous individuals, vying for attention as potential terrorists.\n\nPerhaps few would argue with extending investigative powers to avert atrocities: allowing 14-day pre-charge detention in suitable cases, suspicion-less stops at air and seaports, and applying terrorism offences like possession with intent or preparatory acts to violence-obsessed individuals. But doing so would expand the harshest powers of the authorities, and the authorities can make mistakes about human motivation.\n\nWhat’s more, terrorism legislation does not just apply to violence, so every inciter, encourager or publisher of atrocity-promoting material would become a terrorist, liable to special post-release measures. Complaints are already made about the scope of UK terrorism laws. Although I support the current definition as workable and adaptable, I would be cautious about pushing the law too far.\n\nPossibly the solution lies in borrowing from the tactics of counter-terrorism. Where a “subject of interest” is on the books, police use a range of tactics to disrupt or deter, by prosecuting non-terrorist offending or imposing anti-social behaviour injunctions. Rudakubana’s danger was fizzing off him, but after he exited Prevent, the deradicalisation programme designed to divert potential extremists away from violence, there was no one to manage this risk. By which I don’t mean longer-term interventions such as therapy or medical help and family support, but immediate public protection by law enforcement.\n\nThis is not about definitions, it’s an organisational issue and I think a major one. It suggests the need for a wholly new capability to deal with those motivated by non-instrumental extreme violence. Operating at regional and national level, it would sit alongside counter-terrorism and serious and organised crime but separate from both.\n\nThen there is Prevent. Invented with al-Qaeda in mind, the multi-agency programme has uneasily juggled proto-terrorists and violence-lovers for years. It has been stretched to maximise police contact with school massacre obsessives and young people without any single identifiable terrorist motivation.\n\nEven if non-terrorist violence is kept within Prevent, there is a serious need for humility and imagination in the face of internet influence. Children in their bedrooms are tempted to violence by images, peer-to-peer chat and dark transgressive humour absorbed over hours and hours online. Today’s reality makes the traditional model of deradicalisation years out of date.",

    "date": "2025-01-2500:00:00.0",
    "body": "People whose loved ones have died face waits of several months for bereavement counselling, “elongated” by unwieldy NHS systems.\n\nNHS “talking therapies”, which are recommended by GPs to people seeking support with bereavement in England, were set up primarily for anxiety and depression sufferers, the clinical director of the UK’s leading bereavement charity has said.\n\nAndy Langford of Cruse said that people referred to talking therapies by their GP must wait for a general assessment before being referred for a second time to a specialist bereavement provider. “In the vast majority of instances, a talking therapy service will go: ‘we don’t work with grief so you’re going to have to go to Cruse’,” he said.\n\nIt could take a couple of weeks for the charity to allocate a trained bereavement volunteer or several months, he noted.\n\n“Someone’s waiting time is elongated by having to wait for talking therapies to do the assessment and then the conversation [to say] that’s necessarily not the right service. Then they refer on to us or another provider,” Langford said.\n\nDemand for bereavement support is rising, say charities. More than a quarter of a million people called The Samaritans in 2023 seeking bereavement support.\n\nWaiting times for talking therapies were six weeks or less for 92 per cent of referrals, according to recent NHS data. But many say they have to wait far longer for the right support.\n\nCruse has 83 branches in England, covering 60 per cent of areas. It also operates in Northern Ireland and Wales. The bereavement charity supported more than 22,000 people one-to-one in 2022 but is now struggling with demand.\n\nHannah Coom lost her mother to cancer in March 2024 and found herself caught between different services. She sought support from an Essex hospice but encountered a 10-month wait.\n\nThe 28-year-old instead chose to see a GP but was told to wait six months before seeking general counselling. “But the reason I went to the GP instead of the hospice was because I was so unwell,” she said.\n\nFive months after her mother’s death, she was contacted by NHS talking therapies personnel. She had two-to-three rounds of assessment before they decided she needed “employment support”. “So I didn’t actually get any talking therapy sessions,” she added.\n\nHaving passed the six-month “checkpoint”, Hannah, who said she had experienced suicidal thoughts, saw a second GP who left her without the support she needed.\n\n“I was turned away from that appointment with nothing, that if I didn’t want to take antidepressants then there was nothing else they could do for me,” she said.\n\n“I’m still having symptoms of inability to sleep, flashbacks, nightmares. I’ve just found myself to feel continually shocked that a person can be in so much pain and going to so many places asking for help and there isn’t anything.”\n\nAmelia Wrighton co-founded her charity Suicide&Co in 2020 to help people bereaved by suicide, nine years after her mother took her own life. “When we did our research into the sector, there was just a gaping hole in service provision for people bereaved by suicide,” she said.\n\nDemand for Suicide&Co services has soared since its creation, with wait times tripling from two to six weeks last year.\n\nCruse experienced similar trends during the Covid pandemic. Langford said demand initially dropped in 2020 when people parked their “emotional needs” to prioritise physical health but struggled to meet demand when services moved online during lockdown. The emergence of “suppressed emotional experiences” post-crisis had resulted in a demand surge.\n\n“There aren’t any big grants, there isn’t an NHS contract . . . effectively what we’re doing is subsidising the NHS,” he added.\n\n“Losing a loved one can significantly impact our lives . . . which is why we’ve invested record amounts into bereavement services and suicide prevention,” said Claire Murdoch, NHS England’s national director for mental health.\n\nThe NHS has invested £57mn into suicide prevention and bereavement services during 2019-2024. Despite the increased funding, the fundamental hurdle remains the lack of a joined up network, according to charities.\n\n“A lot of services are quite disjointed,” Anna May, 2020 founder of the Student Grief Network, said. “Some GPs might have a brilliant understanding of how to support someone through grief, or which services they can signpost to, other GPs won’t at all.”\n\nLangford at Cruse said there was a need for a restructuring of NHS services. “There needs to be a network approach to funding services, not a focus solely on what is at the highest clinical need.”\n\nIf you are struggling after a bereavement you can contact Cruse, the Student Grief Network, The Samaritans or Suicide&Co",

    "body": "More than half of young people in the UK say financial support from their parents comes “with strings attached”, according to a survey commissioned by law firm Charles Russell Speechlys.\n\nFifty-six per cent of the 2,000 Gen Z adults polled said financial gifts from their parents came with conditions or restrictions, which might include seeing entrepreneurial children’s business plans, or asking unmarried children who were buying properties with their partners to sign cohabitation agreements, the law firm said.\n\nThe Opinium-conducted poll found that just under half of Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) felt obliged to follow parental guidance when buying a house; about 40 per cent felt the same way when it came to wedding planning and starting a family.\n\n“There’s always a tension when you’re trying to manage relationships in a family and there’s money involved,” said Sally Ashford, partner at Charles Russell Speechlys (CRS).\n\nMore than two-thirds of the young adults polled said it was likely they would rely on support from their parents for significant life expenses, such as buying property, planning a wedding or buying a car.\n\nIn the UK, first-time buyers in particular have come to rely upon parental wealth as rising prices have left all but the wealthiest struggling to buy property without support. In 2023, nearly six in 10 first-time homebuyers received family assistance in getting on to the housing ladder, according to estate agent Savills.\n\nAshford said parents often placed conditions on the gifts they made “to protect assets, not to stop children being able to use them. They want to make sure that if something goes wrong in their relationships or their lives, [the assets] aren’t lost for the family.”\n\nProblems could arise over concerns that children might go “off the rails” and misuse the money or among “siblings of different ages who need money at different times”, she said. Ashford added that children’s partners could also be a source of tension, especially when they “came into the family with less wealth”.\n\nFor those whose children want to buy a property with their partner, declarations of trust — legal documents that record the terms of ownership — can prove useful, CRS said. However, in the case of divorce, the family court does not have to divide the ownership in line with the declaration of trust.\n\nAdvisers say parents should start talking about the family wealth early to avoid tensions later. Conversations could start “at the dinner table”, said Iain Tait, head of the private investment office at wealth manager London & Capital. “Don’t bottle it up, because the longer you leave it, the more difficult it becomes.”\n\nOllie Saiman, co-founder of wealth manager Six Degrees, said parents could teach their offspring the value of investing while protecting their assets by putting money into children’s pensions. Parents can put up to £2,880 each year into a junior self-invested personal pension (Sipp) and receive a 20 per cent top-up in the form of tax relief from the government.\n\n“By gifting into a Sipp you’re effectively creating an investment portfolio for the child that they can see but can’t access until they turn 57,” said Saiman. “It can help them start to get to grips with what happens to money when you invest it.”\n\nTait said parents thinking about gifting should consider their children’s feelings. He gave the example of a child who has worked hard to build up a deposit for a house, and then has a large amount donated by a parent. “Feeling like you need to move into a framework created by your parents can be quite difficult,” he said.",

    "blurb": "Nigel Farage’s party will hold £25,000-a-head event at private members’ club Oswald’s",
    "date": "2025-01-2500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Reform UK is gearing up for a fresh influx of funding as it hosts several former Conservative donors at a £25,000-a-head dinner in Mayfair next week.\n\nParty leader Nigel Farage and treasurer Nick Candy are hoping to raise more than £1mn from the event at the Mayfair private members’ club Oswald’s on Tuesday, party officials said.\n\nIndividuals who have collectively gifted hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Conservative party in the past are expected to attend the dinner, in a pivot to Reform that will increase pressure on Tory leader Kemi Badenoch following several defections from her party.\n\nTickets to the event range from £10,000 to £25,000, and the event expects to attract up to 90 people, said a person familiar with the arrangements.\n\nOne former Tory donor planning to attend told the Financial Times they had chosen a £25,000 ticket, instead of a cheaper option, in order to examine how the party “treat senior donors, whether they respect them”.\n\nThe individual, who has given substantial sums to the Tories and asked not to be named, said: “The interest in supporting the Tories is at an all-time low. The interest in supporting Reform is slightly better, but the jury is still out whether it will deliver or not.”\n\nThe person added they understood the event was a trial for further such fundraisers, adding: “Reform want to see if this kind of thing works.”\n\nParty officials are also making preparations for a larger gathering in the summer — dubbed a Reform festival — that they hope will attract thousands of paying attendees.\n\nThe summer event would be “a celebration of all of the incredible progress Reform has made and all that we and our supporters will achieve together in the coming years”, said another senior figure in the party.\n\nThe two events form part of a drive to raise tens of millions of pounds for the party, as it strives to increase its appeal going into this year’s local elections, and with an eye towards the next general election later this decade.\n\nReform is polling at 24 per cent, one point above the Tories, and three points below Labour, according to an average of recent polls, fuelling concern in the governing party and the main opposition.\n\nThe former Tory donor said they hope Farage will “unite the two strands” by merging the Conservatives and Reform parties. The two parties have ruled out any such move or making an electoral pact.\n\nBut an inpouring of cash into Reform’s coffers would be a fillip for the party after technology billionaire Elon Musk signalled his reservations about giving a sizeable donation to it in recent weeks.\n\nReform insiders say an uptick in donations will be the latest sign of the challenger party’s domestic momentum, after Farage and Candy travelled to Washington for Donald Trump’s inauguration earlier this week and showcased their connections to Maga Republicans.\n\nFarage’s party faces a major test in the local elections in May, however, to prove its support base is not simply a paper phenomenon. Last spring the party fielded candidates in one in seven council seats up for election, and gained a paltry two councillors in total.\n\nThis year party insiders are hopeful of making far more significant gains, including two newly-created mayoralties: Greater Lincolnshire, which they will contest with former Tory Andrea Jenkyns against a Conservative opponent, and Hull and East Yorkshire, where Labour are also in contention.\n\nCandy, who amassed a fortune in the property market and previously donated hundreds of thousands to the Tories, joined Reform as its treasurer last month, vowing to donate at least £1mn of his own money to the party. He has since boasted he will raise at least £40mn for Reform.\n\nA Tory spokesperson said: “The Conservatives are under new leadership and working hard to renew and rebuild trust with the British people.”",

    "body": "More than 3.4mn people are yet to file their tax return a week before the deadline, with tax experts warning HM Revenue & Customs is taking a tougher approach on self-assessment penalties than in the past.\n\nFailure to submit a self-assessment tax return by January 31 attracts an immediate £100 penalty, which applies even if there is no tax to pay, or if the tax due is paid on time. And there is potential for further penalties the longer the return is late.\n\nSeparately, there are additional penalties for failing to pay on time, with fines of 5 per cent of the tax due after 30 days, six months and 12 months.\n\nHMRC said this week that 8.6mn people, roughly two-thirds of those required to file a tax return, had already done so. It urged anyone still needing to file a return to do so by the deadline.\n\nTax experts warned that HMRC is more likely to give penalties in relation to tax returns than in the past. In addition to the penalties, taxpayers will also have to pay a late payment interest rate of 7.25 per cent on the tax owed.\n\nNeela Chauhan, partner at UHY Hacker Young, an accountancy group, said: “HMRC sees fines as an essential part of the taxes it raises for the government and it will issue fines even if you miss their deadlines by a small margin.”\n\nA freedom of information request submitted by the firm found that the number of people penalised for missing the January deadline increased by nearly 50 per cent to 600,000 in 2022-23 from 410,000 in 2021-22.\n\nMeanwhile, the value of penalties issued for late payment of self-assessment tax also jumped to £167mn in 2022-23, up from £120mn in 2021-22.\n\nHowever, she added that it was important to challenge any fines and penalties if you believe them to be incorrect, as they can be cancelled or reduced if the taxpayer can show a reasonable excuse.\n\nOf the 600,000 late penalties issued in 2022-23, 50,000 were cancelled following a challenge.\n\nThose who want to pay their tax on time but cannot afford to pay it in full by the deadline can set up a “Time to Pay” instalments plan with HMRC.\n\nMore people have been required to file a tax return as a result of the government cutting allowances and freezing many tax thresholds since 2022, and experts expect this trend to continue.\n\nFreezing thresholds, rather than raising them in line with inflation, increases tax receipts as rising wages and asset values tip ever greater numbers of people into the tax system or on to higher rates, a phenomenon known as “fiscal drag”.",

    "blurb": "UK chancellor has made more muscular use of Treasury to push changes ",
    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "A barrage of grim UK economic data this month has given chancellor Rachel Reeves “permission” to pursue a more aggressive growth agenda, according to senior government officials, trampling on Labour sensitivities and putting her on a war footing with regulators.\n\nThe chancellor will next week deliver a “growth” speech against the backdrop of a stagnating economy, recent turmoil in the bond markets, and a survey on Friday showing UK businesses cutting jobs at the fastest pace since the financial crash, barring the pandemic.\n\nReeves, who wants to accelerate a number of flagship investment projects, is said by colleagues to have decided after her recent battering at the hands of the markets and political opponents to go “faster and further” to pursue growth.\n\n“There’s a view in the Treasury that all of this is fine,” said one minister. “It is seen as permission for them to go harder on growth measures.”\n\nAn ally of the chancellor said: “She has been frustrated by the speed at which things have been happening. She wants to use the power of the Treasury to show where we want to go next. This is politically contentious stuff.”\n\nFor example Reeves, who attracted Conservative criticism for visiting Beijing this month, is pushing for fast-fashion company Shein to list in London, in spite of concerns about standards in its factories in China. She is also supporting an expansion of Heathrow airport.\n\nMarket turmoil at the start of the year led to claims that Reeves’ job was on the line, but her supporters say she has used the episode to respond with “strength and decisiveness”. She said this month she would be happy to be known as “the Iron Chancellor”.\n\nThe Conservatives, however, say this is laughable. “It is clear Labour are out of their depth and out of ideas to get the economy growing,” said Andrew Griffith, shadow business secretary. “Working people are paying the price for Labour’s war on business.”\n\nGriffith notes that for all Reeves’ deregulatory talk, she is about to impose on companies a raft of new employment laws, which the government estimates will cost business £5bn.\n\nBut Reeves — who this week was talking up the British economy at the World Economic Forum — has shown in recent days a willingness to use the power of her office to take decisive action across Whitehall, some of which is privately applauded by the Tories.\n\nMinisters this week ousted Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, the monopolies regulator that has been criticised for allegedly hobbling growth.\n\nHis departure was a signal to other regulators they must push harder on growth, according to Treasury officials. “Sometimes a message has to be sent,” said one.\n\nReeves’ focus on spurring on regulators has received the private admiration of the opposition. “We should have done this ourselves,” said one former Tory Treasury minister.\n\nYet while some Tories privately approve, Reeves’ actions have ruffled some on her side of the aisle. She has been accused by former shadow chancellor John McDonnell of leaving the door open for critics to say Labour was “defending corporate abuse and profiteers”. Another senior leftwing Labour MP said: “It’s desperate.” She appears, however, to be comfortable making such enemies.\n\nThe chancellor also sided with the banks this week in a Supreme Court case that will determine whether they have to pay out potentially tens of billions of pounds in redress in a motor finance mis-selling case. A new non-dom tax regime has been loosened.\n\nNext week, Reeves is also expected to signal her backing for airport expansion in the south-east, including Heathrow, in spite of fierce criticism from the green lobby and London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan.\n\nWhitehall insiders believe Reeves leaked the move to bounce her cabinet colleagues; Starmer himself has previously voted against a third runway at Heathrow, while Ed Miliband — who threatened to resign from Gordon Brown’s government over the issue — this week played down any suggestion he would quit. Meanwhile judicial reviews of contentious infrastructure projects will be curtailed.\n\nGiven the threat posed to her precarious fiscal plan by sluggish growth, Reeves has told the Treasury to stop focusing on Budgets and concentrate on boosting investment instead.\n\nOfficials are working on a range of projects — some with fruit-related code names — to get investment into Britain.\n\nOne relates to a massive new Universal theme park being proposed for a site near Bedford, with officials close to talks between the company and Treasury saying that they are “progressing well”.\n\nBackers of the project claim it could generate as much as £50bn in economic value in its first 20 years. The Treasury has been asked to provide financial support, including for the upgrading of an M1 motorway junction and the building of a new station.\n\nOne official briefed on the talks, dubbed Project Mandarin, said they were nearly complete: “It’s one of those negotiations you could conclude if you wanted to.” Another person briefed on the talks added: “It’s very close. It’s almost there, but not there yet.”\n\nOfficials said the package of support focused mainly on guaranteeing infrastructure investments and improvements, which will be critical to carrying the thousands of people travelling to visit the 500 acre site.\n\nExecutives at Comcast — whose Universal Destinations & Experiences is behind the scheme — have in the past told the FT that they wanted to build “one of the greatest theme parks in the world”.\n\nUniversal Destinations & Experiences said: “We continue to have productive discussions with the UK government.”\n\nAlongside the theme park, Reeves is also trying to finalise negotiations with AstraZeneca to revive a stalled vaccine manufacturing site in Speke, Merseyside.\n\nThe project was paused after the Treasury sought to reduce the amount of state support provided to the British pharmaceutical company’s vaccine centre, cutting a pledge made by the last Conservative administration from about £90mn to £40mn.\n\nMeanwhile Reeves is also expected to signal her support for a £9bn highway and tunnel across the river Thames in east London, which would use private finance to defray the cost to taxpayers.\n\nThere are also signs that the government hopes to avoid any criticism that it is focusing all its firepower on the south east of England.\n\nThe Treasury has announced plans to review the “green book” it uses to evaluate the value of proposed investment decisions, long the focus of ire from critics who believe it favours London and the surrounding region.\n\nIt has also promised to build a pipeline of investable projects outside of the south east, with the help of the Office for Investment. Reeves is being watched closely by northern mayors, who had been courted by the Labour government when it first took office.",

    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Judges have imposed a cap on legal costs in a High Court dispute between the publisher of the Daily Mail and alleged victims of phone hacking, including Prince Harry, after finding that the amounts both sides were planning to spend were “manifestly excessive”.\n\nAssociated Newspapers and a group of seven claimants including Sir Elton John and Elizabeth Hurley, as well as the Duke of Sussex, had budgeted for a combined total of almost £40mn to fight the case.\n\nBut in a ruling on Friday the High Court only permitted costs of about £4mn each. Mr Justice Nicklin and Senior Master Cook said that while either side could exceed the limit, they were unlikely to be able to recover expenses incurred above the cap if the other side were ordered to pay their costs.\n\nColin Campbell, a consultant at law firm Kain Knight and a former costs judge, said the ruling would likely work to the advantage of Associated, as the better-resourced party.\n\nThe case is the final leg of Prince Harry’s protracted legal battle against the UK’s tabloid press. The prince this week settled his claims against Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, after the company issued an apology for intruding into his private life and agreed to pay him “substantial” damages.\n\nThe claimants in the case against Associated, who also include actor Sadie Frost and former Liberal Democrat MP Sir Simon Hughes, allege the company published stories about them in the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday based on information gathered unlawfully. Alleged techniques include “blagging” sensitive records through deception, using private investigators and intercepting voicemail messages.\n\nAssociated has firmly denied the claims, previously describing them as “simply preposterous” and “lurid”.\n\nThe company had planned to spend £19.8mn fighting the case while the claimants had budgeted for £18.7mn, according to the costs ruling published on Friday.\n\nThe judges said they “had little difficulty concluding that such sums were manifestly excessive”.\n\nThey added that the claimants’ respective legal teams had “considerable expertise in this type of litigation and were not starting from scratch”, citing other legal proceedings such as the case against Murdoch’s company.\n\nThe claims were “really rather simple”, the judges added. The claimants “will either succeed or fail in demonstrating” that each of the articles they have complained about was the product of unlawful information gathering.\n\nA trial has been scheduled for nine weeks, although it is not expected to begin until next January. Several pre-trial hearings have been scheduled for this year.\n\nThe judges said on Friday that they did not want to impose an “irreducible minimum” for costs but set “reasonable and proportionate parameters”.\n\nThey added they did not wish to “downplay the complexity of the factual issues that may arise” but wanted to put them “in the context of the sorts of litigation that come before the courts”.",

    "blurb": "Axel Rudakubana’s actions prompt questions about contempt of court and why disinformation spread online",
    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "When teenager Axel Rudakubana embarked upon a murderous frenzy in the seaside town of Southport last July, he not only destroyed the lives of his victims and their families but also sent shockwaves through British society.\n\nOn Thursday the 18-year-old received a 52-year jail term for the killing of three small girls and the maiming of 10 other people, an atrocity that was followed by a wave of online disinformation and anti-immigration rioting across England.\n\nWhen full details of Rudakubana’s disturbing history finally emerged this week, they triggered a furious debate about the UK’s approach to open justice, as well as the state’s understanding of modern terrorism.\n\nRudakubana was arrested at the scene of last July’s killing spree at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class, still standing over the body of a child with a kitchen knife in his hand.\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed, police released very few details. Disinformation began to spread online, including incorrect claims that the attacker was an illegal immigrant.\n\nViolent race riots followed and the authorities were later accused of a cover-up, particularly by those on the right of British politics.\n\nIt is a claim that police, prosecutors and the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, himself a senior lawyer and former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, have repeatedly denied.\n\n“If this trial had collapsed because I or anyone else had revealed crucial details while the police were investigating — while the case was being built, while we were awaiting a verdict — then the vile individual who committed these crimes would have walked away a free man,” said Starmer on Tuesday.\n\nStarmer’s position, and that of prosecutors, is based on British contempt of court laws dating back to the early 1980s, which restrict what information can be released ahead of a trial to prevent the jury being swayed.\n\nHowever barrister Jonathan Hall KC, who is currently reviewing terror legislation for the government, called the state’s interpretation of contempt law in the Southport case “ultra cautious”.\n\nPolice could, he told the Financial Times, have safely released Rudakubana’s age, ethnicity, nationality, his birthplace of Cardiff and the fact he was from a Rwandan Christian background.\n\nNaming him would have been more complex, as he was 17 at the time, but Hall said prosecutors could and should have applied for a court order to do so.\n\n“Imagine if [police] had put out a clear, calm, authoritative, honest, transparent statement on Twitter [now X] early on,” he said.\n\n“Some people are of course going to believe the worst, or in a conspiracy theory, but most people are just looking for information.”\n\nThe state’s silence may ironically have been counter-productive at trial, said Hall, because the jury could have had disinformation in their minds instead.\n\nThe justice system would now do well to “refine” its understanding of what “prejudicial” means in a social media era, he said, while decades-old contempt of court laws are reviewed.\n\nThe case has also sparked debate about the country’s understanding of, and response to, acts of terror.\n\nWithin days of the Southport killings, police discovered that Rudakubana was in possession of an al-Qaeda training manual.\n\nProsecutors would later argue that this had been used to plan the attack. He had also manufactured the deadly poison ricin in his bedroom, before storing it in a plastic box under his bed.\n\nHowever while he was charged with the possession of terror-related material, he was not charged with committing an act of terror. Even police working on the inquiry said that they initially struggled to grasp why.\n\n“I’m saying: is this not now terrorism, is this not now terrorism, is this not now terrorism?” recollected senior investigating officer Jason Pye, a detective chief inspector at Merseyside police, of his conversations with prosecutors as the evidence unfolded.\n\nA terror charge would also have made his investigation more straightforward, he said. Under terrorism legislation, Rudakubana could have been detained for seven days.\n\nWithout it, police had a maximum of 72 hours to put their case together and gather medical evidence relating to the 13 victims.\n\n“It would have absolutely meant we had the time to do a lot more things,” said Pye of a terror charge.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the sheer range of material found on Rudakubana’s 43 devices — coupled with his lack of explanation for his actions in interview — meant he could not be charged under the Terrorism Act 2000.\n\nThat defines terrorism as being “for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause”. It was later updated to include racial ideology.\n\nAmong more than 164,000 seized documents was violent material relating to the Nazis, Gaza, Grozny and Iraq, as well as footage of the attack on Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel in Australia last April.\n\n“He wasn’t fighting for a cause,” said prosecutor Deanna Heer on Thursday. “His only purpose was to kill.”\n\nStarmer said this week that he understood “why people wonder what the word ‘terrorism’ means”.\n\n“And so, if the law needs to change to recognise this new and dangerous threat, then we will change it — and quickly,” he added.\n\nNevertheless Hall, who is now reviewing the legislation for home secretary Yvette Cooper, said he is “sceptical” of widening the terror definition.\n\nCasting the net more widely, he said, could bring in individuals such as football hooligans or organised criminals.\n\nRudakubana’s case has also prompted questions over how well Britain’s existing anti-extremism agencies are equipped to cope with young people fixated by violence.\n\nIn 2022, aged 15, he told Lancashire police that he had thought about poisoning people and manufacturing poison for that purpose, which he later did. The force said it would not comment further ahead of a public inquiry.\n\nRudakubana was also referred to the government’s Prevent anti-extremism programme three times between 2019 and 2021.\n\nInitially he was referred aged 13, when his school noticed him researching school shootings online.\n\nSubsequently he was flagged for posting on Instagram about the former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, while in April 2021 he was found to have been looking up the 2017 London Bridge terror attacks at school.\n\nOn each occasion, Prevent closed the case, noting that there was no coherent ideology behind his actions. He did not become a subject of interest for counterterror police.\n\nSpeaking ahead of sentencing, Vicki Evans, senior national co-ordinator for counterterrorism policing, said that at the time of his referrals the programme had not caught up with a new generation of extremists.\n\n“At the time the Prevent partnership response to the increasing fixation with extreme violence was evolving, but was less developed than it is today,” she said.\n\n“Although improvements to help tackle this challenge have been made,” she added, “it is right that questions are asked about what more needs to be done.”",

    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Britain boosted its electricity exports to France on Friday as high winds that ripped across the country gave it excess supplies of power.\n\nFrance turned down the power it produces from its nuclear fleet by as much as 4 gigawatts — enough for millions of homes — as it imported extra electricity from Britain, according to Montel Analytics.\n\nIt highlights the changing nature of the power system as intermittent wind and solar energy are used to provide electricity to homes, businesses and factories.\n\nWinds of up to 114mph from Storm Eowyn also show Britain’s growing dependence on its neighbours to buy and sell electricity to balance out an increasingly weather-dependent power system.\n\nElectricity supply and demand has to be matched second-by-second, meaning that at times of high wind, Britain and other countries might be producing more than they can use themselves.\n\nBritain has a number of cables, known as interconnectors, that link its power system to neighbouring countries including France, Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nJean-Paul Harreman, director at Montel Analytics, said France had entered the early hours of Friday morning exporting electricity to other countries due to its own low domestic demand.\n\nBut traders soon started importing from Britain as its surfeit of electricity became clear. “France was exporting into every country it borders,” he said.\n\n“Then Britain said, we don’t need your power, we want to reverse the interconnector. So France was already exporting and then it got extra power from Britain.\n\n“They [France] didn’t have more capacity to export, so they turned down some of the nuclear power plants.”\n\nBritain now has about 30 gigawatts of wind capacity, about half of which is offshore, where wind speeds can get very high.\n\nIf output is too high from wind and other generators and extra power cannot be exported, the country’s National Energy System Operator can end up having to pay wind farms to curb their output.\n\nAs Storm Eowyn hit overnight, several wind farms in Britain had to be paid to switch off, even with the exports, according to Montel Analytics.\n\nFrance’s nuclear power fleet is run by state-owned energy giant EDF, which is also building the UK’s first new nuclear power station in a generation, Hinkley Point C, and wants to build a second, Sizewell C.\n\nNuclear power plants, which supply the majority of France’s electricity, cannot be easily turned on and off like a gas or coal-fired power plant, but output can be adjusted up to a point.\n\nAs well as adjusting its nuclear output, France used electricity overnight to pump water up to hydropower reservoirs, meaning they are ready to dispatch the water to produce electricity when needed.\n\nBritain’s electricity system is becoming more complicated to manage as it becomes more dependent on intermittent supplies of electricity from wind and solar power.",

    "body": "Andreessen Horowitz is closing its London office and pulling back from its much-touted expansion into the UK, as the Silicon Valley investor seeks to refocus on the US cryptocurrency industry following the election of Donald Trump.\n\nThe group made a high-profile entry into the British capital in 2023, opening its first office outside the US with a focus on the UK’s crypto industry amid a crackdown on digital assets by American regulators.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Friday that the venture capital firm had signalled to local entrepreneurs and policymakers that it would scale back the time and money it intended to invest in the country.Soon after, Anthony Albanese, a managing director at the group who helps to lead its crypto investments, announced the firm would close its UK offices altogether.“We’re excited by the enthusiasm for crypto building and adoption in the UK and are encouraged by the recent positive policy announcements and actions. However, we have chosen to focus on the US given the new administration’s strong policy momentum and will therefore be closing our UK office,” wrote Albanese on X.“This doesn’t change our confidence in the UK’s growing role in crypto and blockchain. We will continue to invest in great entrepreneurs no matter where they are in the world, including the UK. We also remain ready to help the UK with its ongoing crypto efforts.”\n\nThe partner originally tapped to lead the UK effort, Sriram Krishnan, stepped away from his London-based role last year before leaving the company altogether to join the Trump administration in recent weeks.\n\nMarc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the firm’s founders, have become supporters of Trump, while advising him on technology policy.\n\nThe switch comes as Trump signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at promoting cryptocurrencies in the US and working towards potentially developing a national digital asset stockpile.\n\nPrices in tokens such as bitcoin have soared since Trump’s election, under the belief that the new administration will advocate light-touch regulation of the crypto sector.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz opened its London office with official fanfare two years ago, with then prime minister Rishi Sunak saying he was “thrilled” at the group’s arrival, and that the move was a “testament to our world-class universities and talent and our strong competitive business environment”.\n\nAt the time, Andreessen Horowitz, which has $43bn of committed capital, made much of its push into the UK, having invested in a number of UK-based crypto companies including Arweave, Aztec and Improbable.\n\n“London is a major financial hub, it’s a major tech hub and frankly it’s a very attractive place for people to live,” Chris Dixon, who leads Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto investments, said to the FT in 2023.\n\nOne UK official downplayed the US investor’s reduced ambitions in the country, saying: “They were never really here.”",

    "event_name": "Government must resist the urge to interfere",
    "blurb": "The chancellor is right to say that regulation is often an obstacle to growth — it needs to be much smarter",
    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "A cacophony of outrage has broken out at Rachel Reeves’ demand that regulators should do more to support the economy. Consumer groups fear losing protections; antitrust lawyers mutter about monopolies; government departments manoeuvre to avoid cuts to bodies they sponsor. Others, meanwhile, have taken the opportunity to exhume dark warnings about the light touch regulation which fanned the flames of the 2008 crash.\n\nThe chancellor is right. Light touch regulation is not Britain’s current problem. In fact regulation has been one of our few consistently reliable growth industries. There is no inherent tension between the economy and smart regulation which prevents monopolies, keeps markets competitive and promotes capital formation. But in far too many cases, we have something different: constantly changing rules which businesses struggle to keep up with; complexity spawning ranks of lobbyists; and inherent mission creep.\n\nRight now hundreds of sites with permission for high-rise housing are standing empty, because the new Building Safety Regulator is struggling to process them, eight years after the tragic Grenfell Tower fire. The Financial Conduct Authority, which failed to spot the Woodford scandal despite warnings from ex-City minister Paul Myners, seems obsessed with imposing diversity rules on companies, in a tenuous attempt to prevent “groupthink”. Whatever you thought of the CMA’s decision on Microsoft’s application to take over a gaming company, the many months it spent dithering were unimpressive.\n\nThere is plenty of room for improvement. But while swapping one chairman (ex-Boston Consulting Group) for another (ex-Amazon, ex-McKinsey) may bring a different culture to the CMA, it’s not a lasting solution. While some of these bodies are demonstrably failing, most are only as good as the remit they were given, by the politicians who set them up. The reason the UK has the highest electricity prices in Europe, crippling manufacturers, is that ministers have long used energy regulation to further their own environmental objectives.\n\nReeves’ instinct is that “the balance has moved too far on regulating risk”. This is partly because Whitehall itself is risk-averse. Officials, keen to de-risk decisions, have a tendency to push too many to Westminster’s sprawling landscape of arms-length bodies. Sponsor departments, in turn, are often reluctant to look too closely at how they are working: making a nonsense of the monitoring architecture, five-year reviews and impact assessments. But ministers are risk-averse too; and especially prone to “Something Must Be Done”-ery. The classic example was in 2000, when the response to the terrible Hatfield rail crash was to introduce safety regulations which caused chaos and were so expensive that they in effect valued the life of a train passenger at over a hundred times more than one in a car.\n\nIn 2015, when I was working in Downing Street, I was surprised to discover that a Whitehall department I was dealing with didn’t even have a list of the regulations it was responsible for. I asked a senior adviser what had happened to the “bonfire of the quangos” which George Osborne had launched five years before. Initially annoyed by my scepticism, he eventually admitted that while some inroads had been made, the system had pushed back, and the result was less a bonfire than a tiny spark. In 2021, the Public Accounts Committee found that spending by those bodies had since trebled; and Meg Hillier, the PAC’s Labour chair, challenged the then government to explain why they were set up in the first place.\n\nBritain used to be really good at smart regulation. The creation of regulatory sandboxes, and the speedy rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, shows that we still can be. But government also needs to ask itself some hard questions about what the state is for, and why we need bodies with confusing levels of overlap. Do we really need both Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator? The Environment Agency and Natural England? When Great British Railways is launched, what will be the point of the Office of Rail and Road?\n\nSir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, argues that the regulation of energy and water has become far too complex. He has proposed that they be regulated as networks, through a single regulator. That would be a much more effective approach. And unless we are able to flex our regulatory systems to better perform their objectives, how will Britain ever be nimble enough to cope with advances in AI, or synthetic drugs?\n\nYou don’t have to be a raving libertarian to feel that Reeves is on the right track. The problem, of course, is the dissonance between what the chancellor and business secretary are saying, and what the government is actually doing. It is setting up a large number of new arms-length bodies. And it is on the verge of unleashing an unprecedented set of new employment regulations, many of which will be unworkable. Just one little clause in that package will make every pub subject to being sued by both their staff and their customers — because its demand that employers protect their employees from harassment will clash directly with customers’ right to free speech.\n\nThere is still time to get this right. But politicians who want regulators to meddle less must curb their own instincts to interfere. That doesn’t come easy.\n\ncamilla.cavendish@ft.com",

    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "British Land and Singapore’s GIC have sold half of Citadel’s new City of London office tower, currently under construction at Broadgate, to Abu Dhabi’s Modon Holding.\n\nA deal to bring in a new investor at 2 Finsbury Avenue, which is one-third pre-let to Ken Griffin’s Citadel and due to complete in 2027, has been hotly anticipated as a sign of growing international investor confidence in the top end of London’s office market, despite concerns about post-Covid demand.\n\nModon is an Abu Dhabi-listed real estate group backed by sovereign wealth fund ADQ and International Holding Company, which is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, one of the United Arab Emirates’ most powerful men.\n\nSimon Carter, chief executive of British Land, said the deal was “a vote of confidence for both Broadgate and the City”.\n\nBritish Land, the FTSE 100 UK landlord, and GIC will each retain 25 per cent ownership of the tower through their Broadgate joint venture.\n\nThe willingness of an international sovereign-backed investor to bet on City office development is a positive sign for the market after a brutal two-year downturn.\n\nInvestment in London offices in the first three quarters of 2024 was the lowest since 2003, according to MSCI, with scant investor interest in large blocks. Blackstone’s roughly £300mn bid to acquire the “Can of Ham” skyscraper was seen as a positive indicator, but the deal with seller Nuveen fell through last year.\n\nModon’s chief executive Bill O’Regan said: “The quality and leasing potential of 2 Finsbury Avenue together with the experience and reputation of our partners, made this a compelling entry for Modon into the London real estate market.”\n\n2 Finsbury Avenue will consist of two towers of 21 and 36 storeys, linked by a 12-storey podium. It marks a major expansion of the Broadgate campus in the City of London, which is already home to UBS.\n\nFinancial terms of the sale were not disclosed on Friday. British Land valued the development at £310mn in September 2024, with £628mn of costs still to come before the project is complete.\n\nGriffin’s hedge fund Citadel and its sister firm, market-maker Citadel Securities, agreed to let 250,000 sq ft last spring, marking a two-thirds expansion of Citadel’s London office space. The deal includes an option for the US firm to increase its lease to half of the building.\n\nThe transaction represented a record rent for the City of London at the time, British Land said. The landlord later launched a search for a new investor, saying it wanted a partner to “share [the] risk and cost” of the project and free up capital for its other developments.\n\nMany developers slammed the brakes on new flagship office projects in recent years, as construction and financing costs rose, office values faltered and investors worried about the impact of homeworking on office demand.\n\nThose factors have resulted in a limited supply of top-quality buildings coming to market, allowing landlords to boost rents.\n\nCarter said he expected a “significant imbalance between demand and supply for new and substantially refurbished space, particularly in the City, leading to strong rental growth at the top end of the market”.\n\nCBRE and Knight Frank advised British Land and GIC. Cushman & Wakefield represented Modon.",

    "blurb": "Axel Rudakubana was able to view Australian clip before murdering three young children despite pleas from authorities",
    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Elon Musk’s social media platform X has refused to remove a video that Axel Rudakubana watched minutes before murdering three young children, despite numerous requests from authorities in Australia and the UK.\n\nAustralian internet regulator eSafety said on Friday it noted with “great sadness” that the video — which shows the violent stabbing of a bishop in Sydney in April — was watched by the killer on X even though the regulator had requested the material be taken down from the platform for months before the attack in Southport last summer.\n\nImmediately following the Australian attack, companies including Google, Microsoft, Snap and TikTok “acted quickly to co-operate with eSafety and ensure the Wakeley stabbing video could not be accessed from their platforms. Some of these companies took additional, proactive steps to reduce further spread of the material,” the regulator said. “X Corp chose not to remove the video from its platform.”\n\nThe footage of the stabbing circulated online in April but X only geoblocked the footage in Australia, meaning that people elsewhere in the world, and local users of VPNs, could continue to view the violent attack.\n\nUK home secretary Yvette Cooper said this week that the government was contacting X directly to ask it to remove the video from the platform. “Companies should not be profiting from hosting content that puts children’s lives at risk,” she told the House of Commons.\n\nRudakubana, 18, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 52 years in prison on Thursday after admitting to the murder of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport.\n\nMusk posted on X repeatedly in the wake of the killings, accusing UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of “prioritising mosques over British girls in their dance classes”. Musk also amplified posts by far-right agitator Tommy Robinson that claimed “Muslims run through the streets unchallenged by police, attacking any non-Muslim”. The interventions led to accusations that he was inflaming tensions that led to rioting across British towns and cities last summer.\n\nOn Friday, Musk shared an article about the Southport killings, saying “never forget”.\n\nBut he has so far refused to intervene to compel his company to take down the video that Rudakubana watched, and the video was still circulating on X as of Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Financial Times contacted X to ask why it had not removed the video but received no response.\n\nThe court in the Rudakubana case heard this week that a search of a Lenovo tablet found in his house showed that he had deleted his entire browser history apart from one search on the day of the attack. Six minutes before he left to carry out the murders, he had searched X for “mar mari emmanuel stabbing”.\n\nWhen police carried out the same search of X during their investigation, they found it led to posts containing footage of the Sydney attack three months earlier.\n\nThe prosecution also outlined Rudakubana’s online profiles and social media handles in court, including his X account. As of Friday, his X account — which is protected, so that only followers could see his posts — had not been taken down.\n\nThe Australian regulator sought to take legal action to try to force X to comply with a ruling to fully remove the video in April, a move that divided the country over whether the government was suppressing free speech or was correct to protect social media users from harmful and violent content.\n\nMusk criticised the decision, accusing the eSafety “commissar” of trying to censor the internet.\n\nThat provoked a furious reaction from the country’s politicians, including Anthony Albanese, the prime minister, who said it was “distressing” that X was fighting the order to remove the video and criticised the billionaire’s stance.\n\nHowever, a court opted against extending an injunction on the video being shown on the basis that X had taken “reasonable steps” to stop the video being shown in Australia. The case had been seen as a potential test case for whether local regulations could be applied on a global basis.\n\nThe eSafety commissioner dropped its case in June pending a review of Australia’s online safety laws.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hannah Murphy",

    "blurb": "S&P’s results add to gloom about economy as employment levels fall",
    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK businesses are cutting jobs at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, excluding the pandemic, as rising costs reignited stagflation fears in the British economy, according to a closely watched survey.\n\nThe S&P Global flash purchasing managers’ survey on Friday showed the net share of businesses reducing staff numbers in January and December was the highest since the global financial crisis in 2009, outside of the onset of Covid-19 in 2020.\n\nIn the latest significant job cuts, Supermarket chain J Sainsbury this week said it was axing 3,000 roles.\n\nThe data will come as a blow to chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has spent this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos talking up the British economy; next week she will give a speech on her plans to boost growth.\n\nThe survey contained some positive news with the headline index, which tracks overall activity in the private sector, rising to a three-month high of 50.9 points in January from 50.4 in December.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected the index to fall slightly to 50 points. Any reading above the 50 mark suggests that most businesses are reporting growth in activity and companies surveyed highlighted product launches and successful marketing as driving activity.\n\nBut the S&P survey also indicated that cost burdens on business rose at the fastest pace since May 2023. Many businesses passed on higher costs to consumers resulting in the fastest increase in average prices charged since July 2023.\n\nChris Williamson, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the survey’s results “add to the gloom about the UK economy, with companies cutting employment amid falling sales and concerns about business prospects”.\n\nHe warned that inflationary pressures had “reignited, pointing to a stagflationary environment which poses a growing policy quandary for the Bank of England”.\n\nLower employment was attributed to hiring freezes and the non-replacement of voluntary leavers in the wake of rising payroll costs, according to the survey.\n\nMany businesses suggested the Labour government’s decision to raise employers’ national insurance contributions, which takes effect in April, had resulted in cutbacks to recruitment plans, while others cited the impact of a post-Budget slump in business confidence.\n\nThe Conservatives have claimed that Reeves’ tax-raising October 30 Budget will destroy jobs and hit growth, and that a major package of labour market reforms — still being finalised by ministers — will also hit hiring.\n\nAndrew Griffith, shadow business secretary, said Reeves would be forced into a U-turn to save jobs, including possibly reversing her planned labour market reforms or the £25bn increase in employers’ NICs.\n\nGriffith said: “To turn this around fast something’s got to give, whether it is the jobs killing Employment Bill, the NI hike or the anti-growth red tape still spewing out — or ideally all three.”\n\nThe Treasury said: “By bringing back political and financial stability, we are creating the conditions for growth and this week PwC confirmed that the UK has become the second most important destination for global investment after only the US.”\n\nEarlier this month, a BoE survey showed that on average in November and December, 53 per cent of businesses expected lower employment in response to an increase in employers’ NICs. Sixty-one per cent expected lower profit margins and 54 per cent to raise prices.\n\nA separate survey published by the research company GfK on Friday showed that consumer confidence fell by 5 points to the lowest level in more than one year in January against a backdrop of concerns over job cuts and higher borrowing costs.\n\nElliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said payroll tax increases, global uncertainty and tariff threats were “driving inflation and output in opposite directions”.\n\nHe added that growth was not weak enough to warrant faster rate cuts, but inflation was strong enough to warrant caution, suggesting the Monetary Policy Committee “has to plot a middle ground”.\n\nSimilarly, Elias Hilmer, economist at Capital Economics, said the PMI figures “won’t alleviate the BoE’s concerns about the weakness of activity, but the further strengthening in price pressures suggest it will cut rates only gradually thereafter”.\n\nAligned with markets, he expects the BoE to cut rates by a quarter-point to 4.5 per cent in February.\n\nThe UK economy registered no growth in the three months to September, marking a sharp slowdown from the 0.4 per cent in the previous quarter. The BoE expects no growth also in the final quarter of 2024.",

    "blurb": "The questions families are asking their advisers, following the IHT shake-up ",
    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "It’s been the busiest January I can remember. Three weeks into the new year and one topic dominates client meetings: pensions and inheritance tax (IHT). Some families could now be paying hundreds of thousands of pounds extra in tax on death due to coming rule changes. Many want to start planning to avoid this now.\n\nTake two of our clients, Mark and Nicola (not their real names). Their strategy had been smart — fully funding Isas while also salary sacrificing big contributions from their business into pensions, simultaneously reducing their corporation tax bill.\n\nThey were heading for a comfortable retirement, with a nice home in Yorkshire and investable assets of more than £3mn. And they had the reassurance that their children would also be financially secure, because nearly all of what was left of their estate on death would be free of IHT.\n\nLast year’s Budget shattered that dream. Now, if our couple die suddenly soon after April 6 2027, their sons could face an IHT bill of more than £1mn.\n\nThe total tax charge on money left in a pension to loved ones might now be 64 per cent. This is because pensions face a double tax hit. First, there is the 40 per cent IHT charge. That would make a £1mn pension pot worth £600,000. Next, the rules as they stand mean that if you die after the age of 75, anyone drawing money from that pension pot will pay income tax at their marginal rate. At 40 per cent, that could mean another £240,000 eventually going to HM Revenue & Customs.\n\nBut it could be worse. Because of tax tapers, the marginal rate for those earning between £100,000 and £125,140 is 60 per cent — an anomaly Rachel Reeves sadly left unchanged. That would give HMRC 76 per cent on funds extracted by a beneficiary who fell within this income band.\n\nIt doesn’t end there. Adding pensions to IHT has made some families worry they’ll topple over the tax cliff edge that arises because of the gradual withdrawal of the residence nil rate band for estates over £2mn.\n\nI won’t bombard you with the maths. Suffice to say that in some circumstances the marginal rate of IHT alone becomes 60 per cent. Add in income tax and, in extremes, the tax could in effect be as much as 84 per cent. You would have to be poorly advised to pay that. At least you have control over the drawing down of benefits so you could make an inherited pension the last pot you draw from, holding off until your marginal rate is lower. But it doesn’t make life simple!\n\nOn top of the pensions issue is the halving of business property reliefs beyond £1mn, which has riled so many farming families. On some farms £1mn does not even cover the cost of machinery, leaving many wondering whether farms that go back generations can remain viable. This has rightly generated a lot of coverage, but entrepreneurs wanting to pass on businesses or who die unexpectedly while still in harness face a similar challenge.\n\nAll these changes are forcing many families to bring forward gifting strategies, triggering a “beat-the-clock” game of passing on large parts of their estate seven years before they expect to die to avoid any IHT.\n\nThe new rules on pensions will not come into effect until 2027, but at a time of year when many of us are reviewing our finances, it is a good idea to start considering the implications today if IHT affects your family.\n\nFor some it will make sense to draw the tax-free lump sum from their pensions — 25 per cent of any pot up to a maximum of £268,275 — and give that to the children as a one-off gift to help with house purchases. This will be subject to the seven-year gifting rules, reducing the nil-rate band available on death within seven years of the gift. Any tax liability tapers after three years.\n\nA simpler approach is to give the money gradually, drawing down more from your pensions and investments than you need and giving the excess away. Yes, you pay income tax but remember that you enjoyed a tax break on your pension contributions and couples who pool their assets smartly may be able to reduce the impact of income taxes.\n\nGifts from excess income are free of IHT but I suggest making regular monthly payments and keeping a record of all transactions in case HMRC challenges your estate on death.\n\nThe changes force people to review other assets, too. I have been asked about putting holiday homes into the children’s names. It is not that simple. If the property has risen in value since bought it you could find yourself with a big capital gains tax bill. Be aware too that you may have to pay rent to continue to use it. And your children will be entitled to sell it if they need the money. You will lose control. A shared ownership structure may be more effective.\n\nWith any gifting strategy there is always the risk of giving too much too soon. Many clients worry about demotivating the next generation. Others are concerned about the money being lost through divorce. This last one can be addressed to some degree with legal contracts. I know some farming families, for instance, who are creating a family constitution. This includes as a condition of inheritance that any family member marrying — or remarrying (this applies as much to the parents as the children) — should agree a pre-nup. And if already married they should go for a post-nup. The constitution brings a degree of professionalism to an emotional subject. It is a way of saying: “We don’t dislike your spouse, and it is not personal. We are just trying to ensure the viability of the family’s legacy for future generations.”\n\nThe other big risk with bringing forward gifting strategies is that you end up short yourself late in life when most vulnerable and needing care. Gradual giving can help mitigate this risk.\n\nWith the best care homes costing more than £4,000 a week, you need to do some serious cash flow planning, considering possible scenarios. Your greatest gift to your children can be that you are still financially self-sufficient in later life. As ever, do not let an obsession with avoiding tax or ignorance of the rules lead you into financial folly.\n\nClare Munro is a tax adviser at Weatherbys Private Bank",

    "body": "Blackstone is closing in on a deal to take full control of a £2bn portfolio of more than 5,000 UK railway arches, buying out its partner five years after a deal that symbolised the advance of US private equity into the UK economy.\n\nThe US private capital group, which is the world’s largest commercial property investor, has agreed to buy TT Group’s half of the portfolio, which the two investors acquired from Network Rail for £1.5bn in 2019, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe transaction would involve Blackstone buying out TT’s stake in the Arch Company, which owns the portfolio. The deal, first reported by Green Street News, has yet to be finalised.\n\nThe brick arches under railway lines are an iconic part of British streetscapes and home to a range of small businesses from micro breweries to auto repair shops and hairdressers.\n\nNetwork Rail’s sale of the vast portfolio became symbolic of private equity’s increasing role in the UK domestic economy, making Blackstone and TT the landlord to thousands of small businesses.\n\nThe deal brought greater investment to the arches, but also raised concerns about more aggressive management and rent increases.\n\nSome small businesses faced steep rent increases as they were dealing with the hardship of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Arch Company at the time offered some occupiers rent holidays and set up a hardship fund to assist struggling businesses. It also negotiated a “tenants charter” with the Guardians of the Arches tenants association.\n\nThe new owners also invested heavily in the portfolio. Some 1,400 arches were derelict when Network Rail agreed the sale and are now being brought back into use.\n\nTT Group, owned by the Pears family and formerly known as Telereal Trillium, is one of the UK’s largest privately held real estate investors, with a portfolio worth more than £9bn.\n\nThe group is looking to free up capital for new investment while Blackstone would prefer to have complete control of the portfolio, said one of the people familiar with the matter.\n\nBlackstone and TT declined to comment.",

    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Good morning. Axel Rudakubana has been handed one of the longest jail terms in UK history — he will serve at least 52 years in prison before becoming eligible for parole. It comes after he admitted to the murder of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, at a dance class in Southport last July.\n\nIt is highly likely he will never be released.\n\nIt is also very probable the law will end up being tweaked so that in the event of a similar future case (the only reason why Rudakubana did not receive a whole life sentence is that he was 17 at the time of the murders) the possibility of parole in cases like these is downgraded from “wholly theoretical” to “non-existent”.\n\nThe more complicated question is about how and if the UK counterterror system should change in response. I wrote a bit about that earlier this week, but now that he has been sentenced and I can write more freely I want to revisit some of it and address some of the trade-offs and some of the misconceptions about the policy challenge.\n\nThe challenge that the Southport murders pose for the British state is that it is not a mental health story or a “traditional” terror story. Many of your responses to Tuesday’s newsletter talked about the deleterious effects of cuts to children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and other youth services more broadly during the last government.\n\nI’m not saying that these cuts have not had important negative effects for the health and happiness of people in the UK. But they were not a factor in this case: Axel Rudakubana was not, and is not, mentally ill. His defence team did not submit any evidence of mental illness and indeed their submission in mitigation was deliberately and explicitly thin. Rudakubana’s defence was led by Stanley Reiz KC, one of our most respected criminal defence lawyers. He had a Rolls-Royce defence team, and you can be sure that had there been an even halfway-plausible case to be made in mitigation about Rudakubana’s mental health they would have found it and made it.\n\nThis isn’t a case about a young man of unsound mind committing a series of horrific crimes. It’s one of a young, violent man consciously planning and choosing to commit an atrocity. But nor is it one of a young, violent man doing so in service of a particular cause. Police seized 43 electronic devices from Rudakubana’s house, and were able to access the contents of 32 of them. They contained more than 164,000 downloaded documents spanning a vast range of extreme violent imagery and information. But what they did not contain was any evidence of an underlying motivation beyond a desire to commit a horrific act of violence.\n\nRudakubana was known to CAMHS, had been expelled from his school, and was three times referred to Prevent, the deradicalisation programme. He had been convicted for assaulting another student. In November 2019, he was referred to Prevent by a teacher after searching for information about mass shootings on a school computer. In February 2021, he was again referred, this time after a pupil reported he had uploaded images of Muammer Gaddafi to Instagram. Two months later he was referred again by a teacher who noted that he had two tabs open about the 2017 London Bridge attack. Between October 2019 and May 2022, Lancashire police responded to five calls about his behaviour from his home address.\n\nOne reason why Rudakubana’s referrals to Prevent didn’t go anywhere is that on no occasion did Prevent find evidence of any underlying ideological reason for Rudakubana’s behaviour other than an interest in violence. And he did not end up being detained for his own safety and that of others because he was not mentally ill. The UK, like most states, essentially has two routes to pre-emptively stop atrocities, and neither fitted Rudakubana. The challenge facing the government is: is it possible to construct a route that would?\n\nAnyone who is familiar with mass shootings will note some immediate similarities. Martin Bryant, who in 1996 killed 35 and injured 23 others in Port Arthur, in what was the deadliest massacre in Australia’s history, had studied the Dunblane massacre which occurred earlier that year. Seung-Hui Cho, the perpetrator of the Virginia Tech shootings, was reportedly transfixed by the 1999 Columbine high school massacre.\n\nNow, most mass killings are not considered to be acts of terrorism, though there are occasional calls in the US to treat all school shootings as terrorism, and calls in many parts of the world to treat some or all forms of domestic violence as terrorism. (I will return to both of these at a later date as they have implications for how the British state might respond to the Southport murders.)\n\nOur understanding of why mass shooters — and more broadly, “spree killers” who may use other weapons — do what they do is not very good, in part because so many mass shooters either end up shooting themselves or being shot by law enforcement. Our ability to detect “lone wolves” of any description is already limited. Frankly, the only policy lever that any nation has found that works to reduce this problem is gun control. It’s the lever that Britain pulled after Dunblane, and tightened further after the Plymouth shooting in 2021. It’s the lever that Australia pulled after Port Arthur, too.\n\nThe state clearly failed multiple times to spot the threat that Rudakubana posed. While it may be easy to look at the list of instances and go “well, why is the home secretary fretting about making it harder to buy kitchen knives on Amazon?”*, that is misplaced. While taking steps on the purchase of knives addresses a very small part of what went wrong here, this is the lever that we know works. Yvette Cooper is absolutely right to want to make buying a knife as tough as she possibly can. We will never be able to outright stop the use of knives, so there is a limit to how far she can go, but she is absolutely right to explore it.\n\nBoth Cooper and Keir Starmer have argued that this case is a reason to change the UK’s counterterror system so that it is better geared up to address and monitor “violence for the sake of violence”, and the new, more incoherent “pick and mix” terrorism that MI5 director-general Ken McCallum warned about in his annual threat update last autumn. They have asked Jonathan Hall, the government’s independent reviewer, to review whether the UK’s definition of terrorism needs to be expanded.\n\nWhat we define as terrorism matters in this case because we grant greater powers to law enforcement to detain, search and monitor people if they are engaging in acts defined as terrorism than we do common murderers.\n\nThere are inevitably trade-offs here. For example, there would be reductions in freedom and liberty if we were to increase the scope of what is and isn’t considered to be terrorism. It also places strain on the security services and on the UK’s counterterror resources. As Hall himself said in an interview with the Times:\n\nThis is genuinely difficult. Taken together, Hall’s review, Cooper’s beefed-up scrutiny of the Prevent programme and the new inquiry into the failures to pick up Rudakubana will provide a useful framework to assess how and whether we should go further.\n\nAn important difference between Islamist extremist terror (roughly 75 per cent of MI5’s counterterror caseload) and the extreme far right (roughly 25 per cent) is that Islamist extremists tend to aim for mass death, while the extreme far right tends to go for specific targets.\n\nThere are exceptions to that, of course, but “mass death” may well be the way to square this circle. Rudakubana was cultivating ricin for that very purpose. Treating violence designed to inflict mass death for its own sake as a form of terrorism might be a way to marry Starmer’s desire for greater powers with Hall’s justified concerns about it swamping the security services.\n\n*Full disclosure, one of the pundits to have been thoughtlessly and reflexively dismissive of that measure is me, as listeners who heard me on LBC’s Cross Question will know. Several of you wrote to take me to task about it and rightly so. I’m always grateful for the many thoughtful replies and emails I get from Inside Politics readers. They sharpen my thinking immensely and I am sorry I have been particularly sloppy at replying to them recently.\n\nThis article was updated to correct the date of the Columbine massacre to 1999.\n\nI’m off to see the West End transfer of what was far and away the best play I saw last year — The Years, the stage adaptation of Annie Ernaux’s memoir. There are still tickets here.\n\nHowever you spend it, have a wonderful weekend!",

    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "The idea behind the concept of generations is that people born at a certain time share similar experiences, which in turn shape common attitudes.\n\nThe “Greatest” and “Silent” generations, born in the early decades of the 20th century, witnessed economic adversity and global conflict, going on to form relatively leftwing views. Baby boomers grew up accustomed to growth and prosperity, and went on to lean strongly conservative.\n\nIt was a similar story for millennials, who entered adulthood in the aftermath of the global financial crisis to be greeted by high unemployment, anaemic income growth, and ballooning house price to income ratios, going on to champion strongly progressive politics.\n\nA lot of analysis and discourse treats millennials and Gen Z as close cousins, united in their struggle to achieve the prosperity of earlier generations. But the validity of that elision depends a lot on where you look.\n\nMillennials right across the western world really were united in their economic malaise. From the US and Canada to Britain and western Europe, the cohort born in the mid to late 1980s lived its formative adult years against a backdrop of weak or stagnant wage growth and cratering rates of home-ownership.\n\nAbsolute upward mobility — the extent to which members of one generation earn more than their parents’ generation at the same age — fell steadily. In the US, by the time someone born in 1985 turned 30, their average income was only a few per cent above that of their parents at the same age, a far cry from the clear, palpable generation-over-generation gains of 50 to 60 per cent made by those born in the 1950s.\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic, the narrative of millennial malaise is no myth. They may go down as the most economically unlucky generation of the past century.\n\nBut we then hit a fork in the road. For young adults in Britain and most of western Europe, conditions have only got worse since. If you thought the sub-1 per cent annual growth in living standards endured by millennials was bad, try sub-zero. Britons born in the mid 1990s have seen living standards not merely stagnate but decline. Right across Europe, there is precious little for the youngest adults to be happy about.\n\nBut in America, Gen Z are motoring ahead. US living standards have grown at an average 2.5 per cent per year since the cohort born in the late 1990s entered adulthood, blessing this generation not only with far more upward mobility than their millennial elders, but with more rapidly improving living standards than young boomers had at the same age. And it’s not just incomes: Gen Z Americans are also outpacing millennials in their climb up the housing ladder.\n\nAll the signs are that in the US, the decades-long slowdown in generation-on-generation economic progress has not only stopped but gone into reverse. Americans born in 1995 are enjoying even more upward mobility relative to their parents than those born in 1965. Zoomers by name, zoomers by socio-economic nature.\n\nBoth the change in young Americans’ economic trajectories and the divergence from their European counterparts pose interesting questions.\n\nFrom a sociological perspective, in an age of borderless social media narratives and algorithms that reward negativity, can the meme of young adult adversity survive contact with America’s Gen Z reality? And with a stream of negative social comparisons only a smartphone away, how will the growing realisation that young Americans are on a higher trajectory affect young Europeans?\n\nTurning to politics, will the youngest cohort of American voters tread its own path? The fact that it was not only the youngest men but also young women who swung behind Donald Trump in the US election suggests this may already be happening. A group that comes to see itself as among life’s winners may not develop the same instinct for social solidarity that its downtrodden predecessors came to hold.\n\nIn an era of “vibe shifts”, the pivot from a sense of downward mobility to one of rising prosperity may prove the biggest yet. A divergence in the mood music on either side of the Atlantic will also surely inject fresh urgency into Europe’s search for an uptick of its own.\n\nWhichever way you look at it, the restarting of the economic conveyor belt in America could prove to be a hugely significant moment.\n\njohn.burn-murdoch@ft.com, @jburnmurdoch",

    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "A Regent’s Park mansion formerly owned by Saudi royals that fell into receivership nearly two years ago has sold for £139mn to a mystery buyer in one of London’s largest ever property sales.\n\nThe Holme, which sits in a four-acre private garden within ​​Regent’s Park in central London, has been sold to a UK subsidiary of Zedra, a corporate service and wealth management firm that runs trusts on behalf of various clients, according to UK land records.\n\nThe £138.9mn sale vies with billionaire Adar Poonawalla’s roughly £138mn purchase of Aberconway House in Mayfair in 2023 as the second most expensive house ever sold in London.\n\n“This is a once-a-decade kind of property . . . a mini stately home in the middle of London, in its own parkland,” said Roarie Scarisbrick, a buying agent at Property Vision. “This is not a house for the shy and retiring type.”\n\nUK companies have to publicly register their beneficial owners. This requirement was extended to overseas companies that own property in the UK in order to increase transparency after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut there are still gaps in the regime, which have drawn criticism from transparency advocates and some lawmakers. The individuals behind some properties can still be obscured through trusts, where information about the ultimate beneficiaries is disclosed to the government but not made public.\n\nProposing transparency measures in 2023, then-housing secretary Michael Gove said: “Trusts can be used for wholly legitimate reasons. But they can, and are, created with deliberately labyrinthine structures to obscure the ownership of assets and make it easier for corrupt individuals to operate.”\n\nThe company registered as the new owner of the Holme is controlled by a Luxembourg-based Zedra entity, according to corporate records.\n\nThe UK government has published new draft regulations that will allow anyone to apply for information about trusts held in the register of overseas property owners — with certain limits, for example, to protect information about minors. If approved, the regulations are expected to take effect in August.\n\nThe Holme came on the market in early 2023 seeking a price as high as £250mn after debts secured against the property expired. It was previously bought on behalf of Prince Khaled bin Sultan al-Saud of Saudi Arabia and his family in 1991 via a Guernsey-registered company called Quendon Ltd, which later listed five of Prince Khaled’s children as beneficial owners.\n\nThe 207-year-old villa, which is owned on a long lease from the Crown Estate, would probably require complex and costly renovations given its heritage status, people familiar with the property said. One of a handful of private residences located inside the central London park, the Holme’s neighbours include the US ambassador’s residence at Winfield House.\n\nPublic records show the property was sold in mid-December by Trinity Investments, an Irish company managed by London-based hedge fund Attestor. The fund is known for its debt strategies, and made a multimillion-pound loan to Quendon secured on the property.\n\nAttestor and Zedra declined to comment. Agents Knight Frank and Beauchamp Estates, who were appointed to sell the house, declined to comment.\n\nLondon’s most expensive house sale, the 45-room mansion at 2-8a Rutland Gate, was secretly agreed just before the Covid-19 pandemic and involved a British Virgin Islands company buying the property for £210mn from a Curaçao-registered entity. The Financial Times revealed in 2022 that the buyer was Evergrande founder Hui Ka Yan, once China’s richest man.",

    "body": "My godmother, a sprightly 77-year-old, died very suddenly last week. Her passing was so unexpected that when the news first reached me, I felt sure it was a scam. Alas.\n\nAs we slowly adjust to life without her, there is some comfort that it all happened so quickly. Survived by my godfather, she has also been spared the trauma of dealing with the administrative and financial aftermath had he died first. It turns out this is something that had worried her in her later years, and finding that out has made me even sadder.\n\nWith major changes to the inheritance tax treatment of pensions on the horizon, I fear the grim complexity of sorting out a deceased person’s financial affairs while you are grieving can only get worse.\n\nMy FT colleague Miranda Green used the term “Sadmin” to describe it. We received an overwhelming response to a podcast we made last year about her protracted struggle with financial providers to settle her late father’s estate.\n\nOne detail that will forever stick in my mind is a phone call she made informing her dad’s private pension provider of his death, which resulted in her being quizzed about an apparent overpayment. So much for empathy! “You do feel that you’re talking to a faceless bureaucracy that no longer cares because that person isn’t going to take their business elsewhere,” she reflected at the time.\n\nFirms urgently need to pull their socks up, but so too does the government. Grieving families have been navigating long delays in the probate system since the pandemic, and more estates are being drawn into the inheritance tax net. HMRC reported an 11 per cent year-on-year increase in IHT receipts this week, and this is set to rise substantially in 2027, when IHT will be applied to inherited pension pots.\n\nAs a consultation on the measures ended this week, financial providers branded the proposals “unworkable” claiming they will lead to increased costs and severe delays in money being paid to bereaved families, even in cases where no IHT is due.\n\nThe key sticking point they are urging the Treasury to rethink is who pays the IHT bill. Under the current proposals, pension schemes would be responsible for paying any IHT due directly to HMRC before any funds are distributed. Yet in order to calculate any tax liability, providers would have to work with executors to find out the value of other pensions and the person’s wider estate, and how to apportion the nil rate band.\n\nAny readers who have ever tried communicating with a pension company will know that the speed of response to the most basic of queries is often glacial. So what are the chances of pension schemes correctly calculating IHT liability within six months of a person’s death, after which late interest payments will be incurred?\n\nThe Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association has sensibly proposed that estates should be responsible for paying the tax, with an extended 12- month period to settle before any interest is charged, to give families and pension schemes time to work out the calculations.\n\nIt has also raised important questions about how IHT will be applied to death-in-service payments. A form of life insurance for employees, I have previously urged readers to ask HR departments if such benefits are linked to a pension scheme, and thus potentially subject to IHT in future (if yours are, ask what your firm intends to do about this before 2027).\n\nAn awful lot of misery and additional distress could be avoided if the government listens and responds to these concerns. But what about the steps we can personally take to prepare for the inevitable and make things easier for those we leave behind?\n\nIf you enjoy reading personal finance articles in the FT, chances are you are the “money person” in your household. I certainly am — so it doesn’t have to be divided along gender lines — but advisers tell me it frequently is. Nor is this issue confined solely to older generations. I have a great many friends — including same sex couples — who are happy to outsource virtually all financial management to their other half.\n\nThis risks storing up big problems in the future if the “money person” dies first — and even more so if the couple were not married or in a civil partnership and thus unable to share tax allowances and defer IHT bills until the second death.\n\nIf the money person was also the biggest earner, assets such as pensions are likely to have been built up in their sole name. IHT changes will require pension providers to be informed promptly of a person’s death — but what if a surviving spouse does not know about them?\n\nA decade of auto enrolment means people have pension pots from previous jobs all over the place, resulting in an estimated £31bn worth of “lost” pensions — a problem that can only compound.\n\nI did an item about this on daytime TV two weeks ago, and was bombarded with messages on social media from widowed women telling me of their struggle to find old pensions and life insurance policies they thought their husbands had taken out. Many messages were tinged with a sense of shame about their inability to navigate the system and track down this much-needed money. Heartbreaking.\n\nFree digital services such as Gretel are making this slightly easier, but the industry needs to take much better ownership of this problem.\n\nAs do we all, of course. How prepared would your partner be if the worst happened, or if you were suddenly taken ill and unable to manage the finances? It’s easier if you have a financial adviser, but often, they will only have a relationship with the “financial lead” of the family.\n\nA recent study by Boring Money found that women over 65 who display at least one “vulnerable” characteristic were the least satisfied with financial advice — the key shortcoming being clarity and communication.\n\nAs well as sorting the basics such as your wills, lasting powers of attorney and life insurance, the digital nature of modern finances is another problem. Miranda had several Tesco bags full of old paperwork to help piece together her father’s affairs. If your finances are in the cloud, how much more difficult is this process going to be?\n\nI recommend a workbook called I’m Dead: Now What? that you can buy online and fill in with helpful instructions about all kinds of things (not just money) that will make things easier for those you leave behind.\n\nHaving conversations with our nearest and dearest about these things while we are still alive is awkward. But the alternative is much worse.\n\nClaer Barrett is the FT’s consumer editor and author of the FT’s Sort Your Financial Life Out newsletter series; claer.barrett@ft.com; Instagram and TikTok @ClaerB",

    "body": "UK ministers are exploring scrapping promised stricter audit rules for private companies as the government seeks to dial back regulation in a bid to boost economic growth.\n\nBusiness secretary Jonathan Reynolds and employment minister Justin Madders have met large audit firms and big investors in recent months to discuss watering down or axing reforms that would designate about 600 companies “public interest entities”, according to people familiar with the talks.\n\nThe previous Conservative government pledged to reform the UK’s audit regimes after multiple high-profile corporate failures, such as outsourcer Carillion, retailer BHS and café chain Patisserie Valerie.\n\nIn 2021, ministers proposed classifying the largest private companies and Aim-listed companies as public interest entities (PIEs). They acted after BHS’s collapse sparked questions about whether audits of non-listed companies should be scrutinised in greater depth to prevent similar failures.\n\nThe designation would place the audits of roughly 600 non-listed companies with 750 employees and more than £750mn in annual turnover under a tighter regulatory system overseen by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).\n\nReynolds told the Financial Times in 2023 that, if Labour won power, it would push through the long-delayed reforms. But one person familiar with the government’s thinking said the reforms were now “ancient history” because tighter auditing requirements were viewed as “another barrier, a ceiling to growth”.\n\nWith Reynolds worried that the proposals would incentivise companies to duck below the 750-employee mark or move overseas, the government might instead compile a list of firms selected for qualitative “importance” or abandon the proposals altogether, the person added.\n\nMinisters have in recent weeks vowed to pursue growth, and last month ordered 17 of the biggest watchdogs to set out measures to boost the economy.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government forced out the chair of the competition regulator after taking the view that the agency was not sufficiently focused on growth.\n\nThe FRC was first tasked in 2018 with improving audit quality after a rash of high-profile failures. The previous Tory government drew up a package of reforms, which included replacing the current regulator with the more powerful Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority.\n\nBut it watered down the proposals in 2022, reducing the number of new PIEs from as many as 2,000 to 600.\n\nAuditors had complained about the tighter scrutiny applied by the regulator in relation to PIEs, with top 10 firm Grant Thornton saying it had sworn off 70 per cent of its PIE work in the five years to 2022.\n\nLabour used its first King’s Speech last year to promise a draft Audit Reform and Corporate Governance bill. The draft legislation might still include the current PIE proposals, one of the people said, and ministers could opt to hash out the details in parliament.\n\nOne ally of Reynolds said the minister was still open-minded about the “specific thresholds” to apply to PIE, adding that the business secretary was listening carefully to views on the subject and considering the wider economic impact of the audit reforms.\n\nThe Department for Business and Trade said it would welcome the thoughts of interested parties before publishing the draft bill later this year.\n\n“Our top priority is boosting the economy and raising living standards for working people and that’s why our audit reform is focused on growth and supporting business to invest,” the department added.",

Usually, they also pay a ground rent, and a “service charge” covering the maintenance of the property. Detractors describe the system as a feudal relic; overly complicated and riddled with scope for abuse.\n\nSebastian O’Kelly, chief executive of the campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, says the problem is “private equity punters” who have found ways to exploit the system. Many believe “fleecehold” needs to be abolished.\n\nReform has been on the horizon for years, but has been repeatedly delayed — most recently, a law rushed through parliament in the final days of the last government was found to have “flaws”, according to ministers. While the government announced that one measure, eliminating the two-year wait to extend a lease after purchasing a flat, took effect on Wednesday, consultations on how to implement some other parts of the new law are expected this year.\n\nIn the meantime, what do I do? I’m preparing to move and, although I have owned a leasehold flat with no problems, I am acutely aware of what could go wrong.\n\n“I just wouldn’t go near any of that leasehold stuff,” a friend advised me as we discussed it after dinner. I looked around his elegant London house and thought: easy for you to say.\n\nSome 4.8mn properties in England are leasehold — just under a fifth of the total. In London, which has a large number of flats, the proportion rises to one in three. Avoiding leasehold implies a big sacrifice in the location and type of property I can buy.\n\n“It’s not a toxic system per se,” says Mark Chick, senior partner at law firm Bishop & Sewell and a director of the Association of Leasehold Enfranchisement Practitioners. “The system can be navigated successfully. It is just a system where there have been historic abuses or individual examples of poor behaviour,” he adds.\n\n“As a species, it works,” says Chick. “There are plenty of people who do own flats and don’t have problems.”\n\nSo if you are buying leasehold, how can you better protect yourself from the exploitative and neglectful?\n\nThe first step is to be clear on what it is you’re buying. When you purchase any apartment anywhere, you usually sign up to pay a share of the cost of running and maintaining the building, whatever that may be — but unlike with a house, you don’t have total control over these. On top of that, comes the leasehold system.\n\nCharley Lowe, solicitor at law firm Wedlake Bell, says misunderstandings are common. “I have many clients who come to me when buying a flat and when I refer to ‘the lease’ they say ‘hang on, I’m not renting it, I’m buying it’, so there is certainly a lack of understanding generally,” she says.\n\nSome leasehold apartments have an arrangement where the residents have control of the service charge, rather than a freeholder. Other flats are sold as “share of freehold”, where the building is jointly owned. Both are seen as superior, as it means the apartment owners have greater control over costs, although the responsibility can be time consuming and disagreements absolutely can occur.\n\nWhen searching for a flat, getting your hands on all the relevant information is often not as easy as you might think: many online listings don’t specify the service charge or ground rent, or even how long is left on the lease (renewing can be costly, especially once it falls below 80 years). Estate agents will provide these details when asked, but ask for more and it can get tricky.\n\nDuring my own search, I asked one agent for a copy of the lease — essentially the contract that I would be signing, but was told the seller didn’t want to “dig it out”. (You can get it from the Land Registry, by post, for a small fee.)\n\nMatt Lewis, consultant solicitor at Commonhold and Leasehold Experts, says that a problem with the conveyancing system in England and Wales — and this goes for freehold too — is that “you only get pertinent information later on, by which point you’ve spent considerable sums of money on legal services and perhaps committed to other costs such as surveys”.\n\nThere are some questions you can ask up front, however (see box)\n\nO’Kelly says a good solicitor is important. “Choose one carefully and pay them properly . . . You [should not] use a ‘factory’ conveyancing legal service when buying a flat — and certainly never employ a lawyer recommended by an estate agent or a developer.”\n\nThe most well-known problem with leasehold flats is cladding, which was thrown into the limelight by the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. The disaster led to much stricter rules on fire safety in blocks of flats, contained in the 2022 Building Safety Act.\n\nThe first thing to note is that it’s not just cladding — buildings are now thoroughly assessed for fire risk and problems must be rectified. Common problem areas to look out for are inadequate fire-stopping (gaps in walls to stop fires spreading), flammable balcony materials and insufficiently fire-resistant doors, says Lewis.\n\nGetting these fixed is often expensive and figuring out who will pay for it is crucial. Lewis described the law in this area as “particularly complex and contains a fair amount of traps for the unwary”, so get specialist advice if you want to buy a flat in this situation.\n\nEveryone I spoke to for this article said it was important to find out who the managing agent and freeholder are, and research them online.\n\n“If you end up looking at a property that has one of those notorious landlords, that’s probably a red flag and you’re going to want to walk away,” says one solicitor who declined to be named.\n\nO’Kelly says to look at press coverage, court reports, Companies House and the website of his own Leasehold Knowledge Partnership. “The really big landlords, all of them are abusing the system, in my view,” he says.\n\nManaging agents should also be checked. There is no formal regulation of these companies, but being accredited to trade body The Property Institute is a good sign.\n\nWhat if, after you purchase, something goes wrong, or you suspect malpractice?\n\nFirst, scrutinise your annual service charge accounts — ask specific questions that signal “I see what you’re doing there”, says Lowe. Freeholders and managing agents are legally required to account for every penny of service charge money — you can ask to see receipts.\n\nAn ombudsman is available for low-level complaints, but more serious ones require legal action. And here, the advice is to tread carefully. Legal action would probably have to be disclosed to a buyer, making it harder to move on.\n\nFreeholders can in some cases claim legal costs from leaseholders — if you sue them, you could end up paying their legal bill as well as your own — though this is due to change under the reforms. Get legal advice before withholding your service charge, as this may put you in breach of the lease and could mean you end up paying the freeholder’s legal fees personally, or even have your property repossessed.\n\nIf enough of your neighbours are also aggrieved, in some cases you can apply for the “right to manage”, whereby leaseholders take control of block management and the service charge.\n\nBut in the end, all property ownership carries risk, as does renting. What’s important is flushing out the risks, and weighing them against a property’s price, location, size and everything else we consider when buying ourselves a home. As Chick puts it: “Nothing can ever be risk-free, but you can go into it with your eyes open.”",

    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Watch and jewellery brands have highlighted the impact on business of the removal of tax-free shopping in the UK.\n\nRishi Sunak, then chancellor of the exchequer, scrapped the VAT Retail Export Scheme in Great Britain — which allowed visitors from outside the EU to reclaim the value added tax on goods bought — with effect from January 1 2021, following the Brexit transition period.\n\nBusiness leaders have since called for the reinstatement of tax-free shopping, with more than 300 — including watch and jewellery brand executives — signing a letter to the current chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in October.\n\n“Tourists are feeling completely unwelcome and disincentivised to come shopping in the UK,” says signatory Sophia Hirsh, managing director of Mayfair-based jeweller Hirsh London. “We deal with a lot of clients that would come normally year on year, sometimes twice a year. They still enjoy coming to London but instead of spending 10 days here, they’ll fly in, take the Eurostar to Paris, do some shopping, come back and fly home — or fly down to Milan. They’re changing their habits and it’s purely because of the tax-free shopping.”\n\nSales to overseas tourists accounted for 4 per cent of turnover at Hirsh London between February and November 2024, compared with 30 per cent for the whole of 2019, says Hirsh, who attributes the slump to the removal of tax-free shopping. And, four years on from the change in policy, her brand is not alone in reporting a drop in trade to international visitors.\n\nFive per cent of retailer Watches of Switzerland Group’s UK market came from a combination of sales to tourists in its stores and airport outlets at the end of 2024, compared with 33 per cent pre-Brexit, says chief executive Brian Duffy. He says it is UK retailers that “have really lost out” from the removal of tax-free shopping because they have “no beneficial offset” — unlike the European luxury brands on London’s Bond Street that also have stores in Paris.\n\nAntoine Pin, chief executive of Tag Heuer, says it is difficult to identify the specific impact of the removal of tax-free shopping on the Swiss watchmaker’s UK sales because there are other factors to consider, including the global economic environment, Brexit, and “the ups and downs of the sector” post Covid. However, he says there has been a “double-digit drop” in both footfall and purchases by international tourists compared with 2019.\n\nOver the same period, Tag Heuer has seen an increase in sales to overseas visitors in Paris, Switzerland and Italy, Pin points out. “Again, you don’t correlate 100 per cent, but you see the expansion of the business out of the UK,” he says. “We also can trace some of our clients who used to buy in the UK, who are now buying out of the UK.”\n\nPin says some tourists consult the internet on their phones in front of store staff, “calculating precisely the benefits or the drawbacks of purchasing in the UK”. The “transit of purchases” to other countries undermines its local investment, he adds.\n\nHirsh says a 19 per cent year-on-year decrease in sales at Hirsh London is partly due to the loss of tax-free shopping, plus a drop in new UK-based clients because they can now shop tax-free in the EU.\n\nFive per cent of tax-free spend in Europe on watches and jewellery between January and September 2024 was by UK shoppers, according to tax-free shopping specialist Global Blue. Customers from the US accounted for 27 per cent.\n\nGlobal Blue’s Watches & Jewelry Study in October found the average tax-free spend per shopper on these items in Europe was up 38 per cent between January and September 2024, compared with the same period in 2019. The category’s recovery is being driven by the exclusive (average spend €28,200) and luxury (average €7,750) segments.\n\nIf there is no change in UK government policy this year, Hirsh says she “will have no choice but look at other options” to grow her business, including working with overseas stockists for the first time. She is also considering holding events abroad.\n\nWatches of Switzerland has focused its efforts on its domestic market. Similarly, Pin says Tag Heuer has mitigated some of its missed sales opportunities by “talking more than ever” to local clients and offering experiences, from an in-store product presentation with a glass of champagne to a visit to the manufacture in Switzerland. These, he says, help build stronger relationships between staff and customers “so that, eventually, the price itself is not the major factor” in a purchase decision. Both companies have offered limited edition watches in the UK.\n\nBreitling launched its Superocean Heritage B20 Automatic 42mm limited edition watch in the UK and Ireland last month, having released the limited edition Superocean 44mm and Chronomat 42mm exclusively in the UK earlier in 2024. “Local special editions have contributed to creating reasons for tourists to buy, while also appealing more broadly by being tailored to the market and produced in limited numbers, adding an element of scarcity,” Gavin Murphy, managing director of Breitling UK, explained in a statement.\n\nWhile the lack of tax-free shopping presents “some obstacles in being competitive with the rest of Europe”, he said the brand, which has 23 regional boutiques, is not entirely reliant on trade from visitors to London.\n\nLast year, the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that the withdrawal of the VAT Retail Export Scheme would save the exchequer £540mn by 2025-26. However, the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy said that a fully operational scheme could have boosted UK GDP by £11.1bn in 2023.\n\nInternational shoppers can still buy goods tax-free if they have them sent directly to their address outside the UK (and outside the EU if in Northern Ireland), but brands say few take up this option.\n\nHowever, UK jeweller Boodles’ VAT-free export sales (excluding ecommerce) rose from £2mn for the whole of 2019 to £6mn for March-November 2024, according to chair Michael Wainwright, with marketing activity in the US key to the growth. Most of these sales were in store, with the jewels consigned by courier. The 2024 figure is, however, a little skewed by a high-price sale to Oman, says Wainwright.\n\nHe says Boodles has been less affected by the removal of tax-free shopping than some brands because it sells predominantly to UK-based clients, but admits sales “could be absolutely on fire now if there was no such thing as the ‘tourist tax’”.\n\nHe cannot see policy changing in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, Duffy — who, like Wainwright, signed the letter to Reeves — is “hopeful” following last year’s change of UK government. “All we’re asking for, actually, is that the government be open to objectively looking at all the facts . . . we believe when they do, they can only come to the same conclusion,” he says. “We therefore think it’s inevitable that [tax-free shopping] comes back. But it’s a matter of when.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: “We have no plans to introduce a new tax-free shopping scheme in Great Britain. Visitors can continue to claim VAT relief where the items purchased are shipped directly to their home country as exports.”",

    "blurb": "Rise in government borrowing costs and warnings of job cuts take toll on economic sentiment",
    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK consumer confidence fell sharply in January to the lowest level in more than a year as a rise in government borrowing costs and warnings of job cuts took a toll on economic sentiment.\n\nThe GfK consumer confidence index — a measure of how people view their personal finances and broader economic prospects — fell 5 points to minus 22, the lowest reading since the end of 2023, according to new data.\n\nConsumer confidence provides a forward-looking measure of household spending — gloomier sentiment means people are more likely to save than make significant purchases. Households built up substantial savings last year, limiting the recovery in spending, despite wage growth outpacing inflation throughout 2024.\n\nThe month-on-month drop in the GfK consumer confidence index was the largest since September 2024, when consumers were concerned about potential tax rises in October’s Budget.\n\nNeil Bellamy, consumer insights director at NIQ GfK, noted particularly steep falls in confidence about the wider UK economy. “These figures underline that consumers are losing confidence in the UK’s economic prospects,” he said.\n\nThe survey was conducted in the first half of January, when the UK’s 10-year borrowing cost rose to the highest level since the financial crisis, threatening the government’s ability to meet its fiscal rule and raising the risk of more tax rises.\n\nBorrowing costs have since eased following a surprise drop in December UK inflation but remain higher than in the autumn.\n\nBusiness surveys in early January also highlighted reduced hiring forecasts, driven in part by the upcoming increase in employer national insurance contributions, set to take effect in April.\n\nConfidence was lower than the minus 18 forecast by economists polled by Reuters but was in line with expectations by Ellie Henderson, economist at the investment bank Investec.\n\nHenderson said news of rising borrowing costs and potential job losses “might well have taken a toll on perceptions and expectations for the economy and household finances”.\n\nConsumers have become “increasingly worried about employment prospects”, said Tomasz Wieladek, chief European economist at investment company T Rowe Price.\n\nThe GfK saving index, which is not included in the calculation of the overall confidence index, leapt 9 points to plus 30. Bellamy called this increase “unwelcome” as it signalled households were bracing for tough economic times by prioritising savings over spending.\n\nThe UK household saving ratio, the proportion of disposable income that is not spent, was 10.1 per cent in the three months to September, well above the 5.5 average of the 2016-2019 period, according to official statistics. Despite real wages rising for more than one and a half years, household consumption per capita remained 2.2 per cent below its Q4 2019 levels, before the pandemic.\n\nBut Henderson argued that when confidence recovers, double-digit saving rates and healthy wage growth could turn consumption around.\n\n“If confidence was to pick up, consumers in aggregate have the means to unleash a higher level of consumption,” said Henderson. “That confidence recovers soon though is less certain.”\n\nHousing affordability has improved, according to separate data published on Friday by Nationwide. It showed that while remaining above long-term average, the price-to-earnings ratio for first-time buyers fell to 5 at the end of last year from a peak of 5.8 in 2022. Similarly, mortgage payments for first-time buyers fell to 36 per cent of their take-home pay, from a peak of 38 per cent at the end of 2023.",

    "body": "Energy secretary Ed Miliband says he will not resign if the UK government approves a third runway at Heathrow, making the scheme more likely to proceed after two decades of wrangling.\n\nMiliband has long fought against expanding Britain’s biggest airport on climate and pollution grounds, threatening to resign from the cabinet 17 years ago and opposing the scheme when he was Labour leader.\n\nAs energy secretary, Miliband has a significant responsibility to help Britain hit its net zero climate targets. But when he was asked on Thursday if he would resign if the Labour government backed the scheme, he replied: “No, don’t be ridiculous.”\n\nMiliband’s concession comes as chancellor Rachel Reeves prepares to use a “growth speech” next week to signal her economic priorities, including her support for the expansion of three London airports: Heathrow, Luton and Gatwick.\n\nGatwick and Luton are set to receive approval this spring for expansions from Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary.\n\nBut Heathrow Airport Holdings has not yet put forward a “development consent order” application for a third runway because of a lack of political support.\n\nThe company paused its planning for a third runway when the Covid pandemic struck in 2020, but has indicated it would make a decision on whether to go ahead this year.\n\nSadiq Khan, Labour mayor of London, is opposed to the scheme, telling the London Assembly on Thursday that his views had not changed.\n\nKhan questioned whether Heathrow’s expansion could meet the government’s tests on noise and air pollution and climate change, adding: “We face a climate crisis and a climate emergency.”\n\nMiliband told reporters that the government could realise its economic growth aims while also achieving its climate targets, despite environmentalists’ concerns about the impact of expanding Heathrow.\n\nWhen Miliband voted against the project in the Commons in 2018 — along with now prime minister Sir Keir Starmer — he said “we owe it to future generations not just to have good environmental principles but to act on them”.\n\nOn Thursday the energy secretary said any airport expansion would have to take place within the UK’s “carbon budgets” through which the country aims to gradually cut net carbon emissions to zero by 2050.\n\nThe independent advisory Climate Change Committee has warned against airport expansion without a national plan to curb emissions and to manage passenger capacity.\n\n“We believe that we can meet our growth mission — our number one priority — and keep within carbon budgets, and indeed that our clean energy mission is crucial and a central part of meeting our growth mission,” said Miliband.\n\n“Far from them being in contradiction, they are absolutely complementary.”\n\nEnvironmental groups believe that airport expansion is incompatible with cutting greenhouse gas emissions, as the aviation industry struggles to decarbonise its operations.\n\nAirlines have pledged to reach net zero by 2050, chiefly through the use of “sustainable aviation fuels” produced from non-fossil materials — including used cooking oil and animal fats.\n\nBut these fuels are far more expensive than jet fuel and in short supply.\n\n“Aviation has no short- to medium-term solutions for its carbon footprint,” said Alex Chapman, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation, a think-tank that opposes airport expansion.\n\nReeves said last July that she wanted Heathrow to build a third runway.\n\nOn Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, she said a third runway would boost economic growth.\n\n“We will look at all plans to bring infrastructure, to bring investment to Britain,” she said. “When there are decisions around infrastructure investment, the answer can’t always be ‘no’, and with this government the answer is ‘yes’”.",

    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "After weeks of sinking business confidence following her Budget tax increases, Rachel Reeves came to Davos with a clear goal: to re-set her relations with big investors.\n\nHer charm offensive in the Swiss resort included meetings with business leaders and public appearances in which she upbraided regulators, promised to ease lending rules, prioritised growth over net zero goals, and pledged to tweak non-dom tax rules.\n\nMany listening recognised the UK government’s efforts to change the grim narrative of the past months — but are not yet convinced that it will secure stronger growth. With the public finances under pressure, government borrowing costs up, and the UK economy flatlining in the second half of last year, the Labour government has a significant job ahead to bolster optimism.\n\n“Rachel Reeves is thinking the right way but she’s in a difficult position,” said a senior UK bank executive in Davos. “Labour in the UK have made a lot of good decisions but it is very hard for them and the [bond market] challenges of last week reinforce that issue.”\n\nThe chancellor is leading an effort by Labour to pivot away from the gloomy messaging it adopted after winning power — focused on a dire fiscal inheritance from the Conservatives — to a regulation-slashing message that will be attractive to business.\n\nMany investors feel a more upbeat pitch is long overdue. Mohammed Alardhi, executive chair of $53bn investment manager Investcorp, whose investments in the UK include real estate logistics and education, said: “When the government continues to talk about doom and gloom because they inherited bad things from the Conservatives, investors and businesses will believe you and go somewhere else.\n\n“There needs to be better and more positive messaging for the future. Everyone knows there are problems with deficits and budgets.”\n\nThe meetings of the World Economic Forum in Davos gave Reeves an opportunity to woo investors rattled by the UK’s poor growth performance.\n\nThe chancellor repeatedly brandished her focus on easing regulatory burdens in areas such as technology, planning and financial services as she sought to make a virtue out of Britain’s room for manoeuvre following Brexit.\n\n“We have that flexibility: we can be more nimble. We are taking advantage of that,” she said at an event during the summit.\n\n“While the UK benefits from a stability bump, we would hope to see the appropriate reforms implemented to fuel growth,” said Jo Taylor, chief executive of Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan — one of the country’s largest investors with stakes in offshore wind projects, energy networks and airports.\n\nPatrick Thomson, who leads JPMorgan Asset Management in Europe, said: “From an investor perspective, everything the government is saying makes sense.” He cited examples including consolidating pension funds, telling regulators to allow more risk-taking, reinvigorating the market for listings, reforming planning, and prioritising artificial intelligence.\n\nBut the UK’s biggest partner is driving harder, as global markets are buoyed by US President Donald Trump’s pledges to slash regulation and cut taxes and bolster economic growth. The mood among investors towards European countries — including the UK — remains relatively gloomy.\n\n“The outlook is quite bleak for the UK in terms of growth,” said the chief executive of one of the world’s largest pension funds. “I’m not sure Europe is a lot better. It’s all about North America . . . everyone is fixated on the US: it’s the easy shout.”\n\nTrump’s aggressive deregulation push — including appointing Elon Musk to lead the new waste-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge — has put added pressure on governments across Europe to convince businesses they are easing burdens and cutting red tape as they seek to prop up competitiveness.\n\n“Everyone here at Davos is taking a page out of the Donald Trump playbook,” said Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, at Davos. “We’ve heard comments from [European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen] and Rachel Reeves and more. Countries are thinking that they need their own Doge — and that means less red tape, deregulation and a priority on growth.”\n\nThe UK is awaiting clarity on how Trump’s vows to slash regulation will affect Wall Street. This month the Bank of England delayed its final capital rules for a further year given the uncertainty in the US. Some bankers believe the UK could move faster than the EU in response to the emerging US regime given it is not bound by Brussels procedures.\n\n“We have to respond to the agenda the US president has just set out with our own dynamism,” Jonathan Reynolds, business secretary, told the Financial Times in Davos. “Every country has to do it.”\n\nThe past week has shown that the UK government is willing to be aggressive in pursuing growth, with ministers intervening to remove the chair of the under-pressure monopoly regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nA big investor in the UK described the removal of Marcus Bokkerink, which was first reported by the FT, as “the most muscular action taken by a UK government to rein in a regulator for some time”.\n\nThey added: “It should hopefully put other regulators on notice that they could face similar consequences if the government’s growth agenda doesn’t receive serious attention and follow-through.” The investor name-checked the Financial Conduct Authority as another regulator that should pay “close attention” to the government’s move.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Reeves repeatedly insisted that growth was the government’s number-one mission.\n\nShe warned that “too many things are holding back the supply-side of the economy”, decrying “crazy” rules impeding infrastructure planning and alluding to the £100mn price tag on an arch to protect bats from the High Speed 2 rail line.\n\nAreas where UK officials were eager to use the country’s flexibility include AI, she said, arguing that the country’s regulations were “much more permissive, much more pro-growth than what you see in many other countries around the world, including in the European Union”.\n\nYet the UK’s freedom of manoeuvre will be constrained by its parallel drive to obtain a “reset” in its relations with the EU in order to break down some of the barriers that have sprung up since Brexit. Uncertainty over how it will navigate between the two massive economies it trades with threatens to hang over the economy.\n\nAllies of Reeves were clear that they had made progress during their frenetic round of meetings in Davos. “It’s going to be months and years of hard work, but we have shifted the dial in the last week and that is what businesses are telling us,” said one. “It’s not job done on growth but we have made a huge amount of progress. We’ve never been more focused and determined.”\n\n“We need that fast and furious approach to delivery on the ground, and those actions need to match the ambition,” said Rain Newton-Smith, the director-general of the CBI.\n\n“It does feel like the building blocks are there but it will take courage and doubling down on the things that really help to drive growth.”\n\nReporting by Sam Fleming, Harriet Agnew, Ortenca Aliaj, Arash Massoudi and Stephen Morris in Davos",

    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government has approached consultancies about taking the role of special administrator in a sign that ministers are bracing themselves for the imminent renationalisation of Thames Water.\n\nConsultancies including Teneo, Interpath and EY are among the potential candidates to run a so-called special administration regime, according to people familiar with the process. A SAR is a temporary measure designed to keep services running, and suppliers and staff paid, in the event of a corporate collapse.\n\n“We are ready now, we could do one [SAR} today, if we had to,” said one official. “Incidentally, being ready for a SAR is also the strongest lever that we as government can have to make sure that another market-led, private-led solution is found.”\n\nThames Water is struggling under its £19bn debt pile and has warned that it will run out of cash in March unless the High Court signs off a controversial £3bn loan at a hearing in early February.\n\nAnother government official said that there had been “informal engagement” with certain consultancies over a special administrator role but no formal interview process.\n\nSteve Reed, the environment secretary, said in October that he had “ruled out nationalisation”.\n\nOfficials insist that taking the company into SAR would not technically be a nationalisation despite it being a big state intervention.\n\nBut plunging Thames Water into special administration may be unavoidable if the court blocks the loan agreed with its senior creditors, or if the company runs out of cash earlier than expected. The £3bn loan is controversial because it would carry an interest rate of 9.75 per cent as well as fees and incentives for the existing Thames Water management.\n\nThe agreement is being challenged by a separate group of Thames Water’s junior creditors — which have proposed a cheaper deal — and by environmental campaigners who argue that the company would be better off in special administration.\n\nThe loan would buy the company time to raise at least £3bn of equity in a parallel process. Companies including Castle Water, Covalis and CKI Infrastructure are among investment groups lining up to put in potential bids for the utility.\n\nBidders and creditors are waiting to see if the company appeals to the Competition and Markets Authority over regulator Ofwat’s decision last month on the level by which water companies can hike customer bills over the next five years. Thames Water has not yet made a decision whether to appeal Ofwat’s decision to the CMA, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nOfwat has said that Thames will be allowed to raise bills 35 per cent — much lower than the 59 per cent increase it had sought — taking average bills from around £436 now to £588 between now and 2030.\n\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Thames Water and Ofwat did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nEY, Teneo and Interpath declined to comment.\n\nIn an update to the market on Wednesday, the company’s chief restructuring officer, Julian Gething, said: “Our plan delivers for customers and stakeholders by unlocking up to £3bn of new money and securing a total of £3.5bn of debt maturity extensions over the next two years and cash releases, so we can continue investing the billions of pounds required to improve our network’s resilience.\n\n“We believe it is the only implementable solution to enable the equity investment required to provide stability and certainty in the longer term and will not impact customer bills.”\n\nThe government’s choice of administrator may be complicated by potential conflicts of interest. Teneo is already an adviser to Thames Water and has received £5mn in fees since August 2023. It had also received at least £60mn from running the special administration of collapsed energy supplier Bulb, according to the National Audit Office.\n\nIt has also written a report to the High Court supporting the senior creditors’ £3bn loan, while Interpath has written a separate report on behalf of the junior creditors.\n\nSir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at Oxford university, has argued that a SAR would enable Thames Water to focus on a restructuring and on delivering improvements, rather than on negotiating a deal with creditors.",

    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "A teenager has been handed one of the longest jail terms in UK history for the “sadistic” and “meticulously planned” murder of three small children in Southport last July.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 18, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 52 years in prison on Thursday after admitting to the murder of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Da Silva Aguiar, nine, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.\n\nHe had also pleaded guilty to 10 attempted murders, as well as possession of an al-Qaeda training manual and the toxic substance ricin.\n\nAfter time already served, the minimum sentence was 51 years and 190 days. Sentencing, Mr Justice Goose said: “It is highly likely that he will never be released.”\n\nRudakubana is said to have shown no remorse since the attacks six months ago, which prompted riots across the country and questions about how authorities failed to spot multiple warning signs about his behaviour.\n\nLiverpool Crown Court heard that he had gloated about the killings at a police station after his arrest, saying: “It’s a good thing those children are dead . . . so glad . . . so happy.”\n\nThe court heard harrowing details about the attack itself, and that Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time, had planned his rampage for several weeks beforehand.\n\nSix minutes before leaving his house at 11.10am on Monday, July 29, he searched the social media platform X for footage of a terror attack that had taken place in Australia a few months earlier, in which the bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was stabbed at a church in Sydney.\n\nDoorbell footage then shows him pacing up and down outside his house with his hood up.\n\nArmed with a 20cm kitchen knife, he caught a taxi to the workshop in the Hart Space centre, Southport, where 26 children had gathered to dance, sing and make friendship bracelets.\n\nThe court heard that Rudakubana went upstairs to the class and 30 seconds later began stabbing children wordlessly.\n\nHe stabbed some victims in the back as they tried to escape. Alongside the three murdered children, eight other children and two adults were also injured.\n\nPolice found Rudakubana silently standing over a child’s body on the landing, still holding the kitchen knife he had used to carry out the attack.\n\nLater searches of the house he shared with his parents in Banks, Lancashire, uncovered a machete, a set of arrows, bottles with matches attached, and an Apollo Cerbera knife identical to the one used in the attack. Both knives had been bought on Amazon on July 13, using a virtual private network to encrypt his internet address.\n\nPolice also found a plastic box containing a “pulp”-like substance under his bed. Tests by the UK government laboratory Porton Down confirmed it to be the deadly substance ricin, which he had made in his bedroom.\n\nPolice also seized 43 electronic devices from his home, 32 of which they were able to access.\n\nWhile his internet search history had mostly been deleted, they uncovered more than 164,000 downloaded documents spanning a vast range of extreme violent imagery and information. Subject matter included beheadings, genocides, wars in Iraq, Rwanda, Gaza and Sudan, and images of weapons.\n\nRudakubana had also downloaded an academic paper containing an excerpt from an al-Qaeda training manual.\n\nMr Justice Goose concluded that Rudakubana had followed the instructions it contained in order to carry out the killings.\n\n“I am satisfied that for some time, he had planned to kill as many people as he could,” he said, adding that anyone who had heard the evidence in the case “would describe what he did as evil”.\n\nMerseyside chief constable Serena Kennedy said the murders had amounted to a “sadistic” rampage carried out by a teenager with an “unhealthy fascination with violence”.\n\n“Having researched atrocities committed by others, the evidence suggests that he set out to emulate them on July 29,” she said, adding that there was no evidence he ascribed to “any particular political or religious ideology”.\n\n“He wasn’t fighting for a cause,” she said. “His only purpose was to kill and he targeted the youngest, most vulnerable in order to spread the greatest level of fear and outrage, which he succeeded in doing.”\n\nRudakubana — who had been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and had been known to children’s and mental health services, as well as the anti-extremism programme Prevent — said nothing in formal police interviews.\n\nDuring Thursday’s hearing Rudakubana shouted over the prosecutor and demanded to see a paramedic.\n\nThe court heard he had stopped eating while on remand. He was taken away for medical checks and did not return to court, after promising to continue disrupting proceedings.\n\nThe attack last July helped to spark a wave of riots across the UK, including in the Merseyside town of Southport itself, after misinformation spread online that the attacker was an illegal immigrant.\n\nRudakubana, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan immigrants, was not charged with an act of terror, although he was convicted of possessing terror-related material. Police and prosecutors said that current legislation did not allow for a terror charge due to Rudakubana’s apparent lack of ideology.\n\nThey said there was no evidence he had been working with others, or of activity in online chats or forums.\n\nHowever, he had been known to the government’s anti-extremism programme Prevent, to whom he was referred three times between 2019 and 2021.\n\nOn the first occasion, in November 2019, he was referred by his school after searching for information on school shootings during an information technology class.\n\nIn February 2021, he was referred after a fellow pupil raised concerns over his Instagram posts about former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi. Two months later he was referred by a teacher who noted he had two tabs open on his computer about the London Bridge terror attacks of 2017.\n\nIn each case, the programme took no further action, noting a lack of overriding ideology.\n\nAhead of the sentencing Vicki Evans, senior national co-ordinator for Counter Terrorism Policing, said the Prevent programme’s understanding of such extremism had still been “evolving” at the time.\n\nEarlier this week Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced a public inquiry into the killings, as well as a review of the Prevent programme.\n\nLancashire police were contacted five times about Rudakubana between 2019 and 2022.\n\nIn March 2022, he went missing and was found by police in possession of a knife. He told officers that he wanted to stab someone and had thought about poisoning people.\n\nRudakubana had also been convicted under the youth justice system after attacking a fellow pupil with a hockey stick in 2019. He had taken a knife into school 10 times previously.\n\nLancashire police said prior to sentencing that it had reviewed each of its call-outs to Rudakubana but could not discuss the details further, due to the forthcoming public inquiry.\n\nIn court, victims and their families read out harrowing accounts of the impact last July’s attack had on their lives.\n\nLeanne Lucas, who had organised the dance class in Southport, was stabbed by Rudakubana and helped many of the children escape.\n\n“As a 36-year-old woman,” she said, “I cannot walk down the street without holding my breath as I bypass a person and then glance back to see if they’ve attempted to stab me.”",

    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Good afternoon. It’s been hard to know where to look this week, what with the second Trump administration’s opening salvo on taxes and tariffs alongside Rachel Reeves’ increasingly aggressive demands on regulators to deliver growth, but I choose the home front.\n\nThe ousting of Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the Competition and Markets Authority on Tuesday evening — pour encourager les autres — was part of a concerted attempt by the government to shift the narrative on growth.\n\nReeves let it be known that growth — including potentially expanding Gatwick and Luton airports and adding a third runway at Heathrow — must trump all other priorities, including the drive to net zero.\n\nAt the same time, the government announced the next raft of planning reforms, including establishing a ‘Nature Restoration Fund’ where developers can pay into a pot for projects that offset the damage caused by developments.\n\nAs you’d expect, there are already complaints and objections from this apparently gung-ho approach, including from backbench Labour MPs who are reportedly “holding their heads in despair” at the sight of a Labour chancellor pedalling a Tory narrative on deregulation.\n\nBut I suspect Reeves won’t mind that too much, because there really is a need to change the narrative — not just of this government, which has had a wretchedly flat-footed beginning, but of the entire post-Brexit period.\n\nTurning the page, telling a story\n\nLast week Labour Together, the party’s in-house think-tank, published a timely report setting out how post-Brexit UK needs to get its mojo back, in a “more dangerous and competitive world”, as evidenced this week by Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nThe report’s author, Jonathan McClory of strategy firm Sanctuary Counsel, assembled a panel of UK and international diplomats, academics and investors to create a semi-structured focus group to try to identify a new way forward.\n\nEven though none were asked specifically about Brexit, almost all brought it up. This is not about trade barriers, per se, but about the reputational damage caused to the UK as a place to do business and the failure to build a compelling new national narrative outside the EU.\n\nAs one interviewee noted:\n\n“The chaotic political handling of Brexit has left an impression of a country that doesn’t know what it wants, doesn’t have the capacity to think about its interests, and is consumed by slogans rather than strategy”.\n\nThree other key takeaways: firstly, the UK interviewees were gloomier than the international ones, which tells you that too much self-flagellation over Brexit is counterproductive. As Sir Keir Starmer keeps saying, “we need to move on”. But it’s actions that matter, not words.\n\nSecondly, that the UK’s future softpower advantage should be centred on “science, technology, and innovation” — AI, green technology, bioengineering — at least as much as traditional cultural advantages.\n\nThis is not to dismiss our traditional values around history — the UK invented most of the world’s sports, for example — and we’re good at the flummery that comes with an active royal family. But in this new ground zero world of AI, rampant tech, pandemics and climate change, the argument is that “it’s time to move on”.\n\nAnd thirdly, and most importantly, that the rebirth starts at home. We can tie ourselves in knots over the ‘EU reset’ and how to handle Donald Trump (“Heaven help us”, as one senior government insider put it to me this week) but the foundations that need fixing first are here.\n\nAs another interviewee said, “The UK needs to put its domestic affairs in order first,” adding, encouragingly: “once [the UK] manages that, it could really be a leader on many of the areas the global community is struggling with.”\n\nSaying is not doing, but it’s a start\n\nObviously, putting domestic affairs in order is not just about giving speeches in Davos to please corporate investors, but that’s not a bad place to start if you’re trying to stem the tide of relentlessly negative reactions to a Budget that has weighed on hiring and investment.\n\nThe next step is to join the dots. As a reader pointed out after last week’s newsletter, it sends a powerful signal that Angela Rayner overruled the Environment Agency to green-light a Cambridge housing development last December that had been blocked over water scarcity concerns.\n\nBut that needs to be accompanied by an actual plan to reduce water consumption, release finance for a new water pipeline and, ultimately, deliver a new reservoir after a period of 35 years when the UK has failed to build a single one.\n\nAs well as long-term investment, that requires lining up all the strategic regulators, from Ofwat to the Environment Agency and to actually get it done — and have it seen to be done. Reeves made a start on that this week.\n\nIt also means, for example, that if you’re going to have an industrial strategy that draws talent from all across the world, prevailing on the Home Office to make visas easier and more plentiful — and daring to make the political argument why this is necessary.\n\nAnd it means, if you’re going to have a ‘trade strategy’, actually injecting some urgency and ambition into the EU-UK ‘reset’ (still not too late), which leads to another argument over immigration and the repeated failure of a homegrown skills strategy.\n\nOr it could mean, according to Chris Southworth at the International Chamber of Commerce, taking aggressive steps to remove what he calls the “over zealous regulation” that makes it so difficult for SMEs in particular to obtain trade finance.\n\nSo while there probably isn’t much in the coming EU ‘reset’ that will fix things for SMEs who’ve been hammered by Brexit, Southworth argues there are steps — on access to finance and trade digitisation — that the UK can do at home to get UK companies exporting.\n\nHe’s not convinced that the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority is going far enough to remove barriers that are a legacy of 9/11 and the 2008 financial crash and are stifling the ability of SMEs to obtain low risk, short-term working capital.\n\n“I would have liked to see far more radical and ambitious ideas such as removing capital requirements for SMEs altogether. This would inject far more confidence into the market that the PRA are getting serious on supporting growth,” he says.\n\nMake no mistake, the mood is pretty grim. But as I heard while chairing the annual Executive Survey for MakeUK, the manufacturing body, this morning, it’s far from terminal if the government can build a compelling narrative for Britain.\n\nBusiness is labouring under heavy additional costs as a result of the Budget but as the CEO of medical products maker Vernacare Alex Hodges said, there is also a well of optimism waiting to be tapped — they just want the government to lean in a bit.\n\nSo I can think of lots of reasons why various growth-enhancing measures (some examples above) won’t happen; but after making such a desperately low-key start to their term in office, ousting a prominent regulator and promising to ‘build baby, build’ is at least sending a strong signal that you intend to have a serious go at it.\n\nThis week’s chart comes from a thought-provoking report by the Centre for Cities think-tank which maps the link between places engaged in exporting activities and higher wages and productivity.\n\nThe report uses national data to show that exporting activities are the drivers of UK productivity growth, with sectors like IT, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and finance leading growth since 1997.\n\nThis is because exporting activities, particularly in the new industries, have a “greater ability to absorb new innovations and use creativity to create value”, and also have greater resilience because they can access more markets and ride out cyclical downturns.\n\nThis is the mechanical link between trade and growth. So as the Centre for Cities chief executive Andrew Carter observes, the report highlights the need — political constraints aside — to deepen that relationship as far as possible.\n\n“We clearly need to have the most advantageous relationship and arrangement with Europe as we can possibly get. There’s the difficult politics of that but the further we move away from the best version of an arrangement, the harder it gets,” he says.\n\nFor all that, the government remains committed to a deeply limited EU ‘reset’ strategy, hemmed in by its red lines on single market and customs union membership.\n\nWe’ll see if the fallout from Trump leads to a pinking of those red lines in a bid to unlock areas that would help attract investment, via improved access to the UK’s largest export market for both people and goods.\n\nWe are now approaching the point, as the agenda is drawn up for the first EU-UK ‘reset’ summit in March or April this year, when we’ll start to see how ambitious the UK is prepared to be.\n\nEven keeping to the red lines, there are things to be done: the youth mobility deal (which could bleed into elements of professional mobility), full alignment with the EU’s carbon-markets (to reduce carbon border tax friction) and maybe even some fixes on customs.\n\nOne area that is being flirted with in London is the UK joining the Pan-Euro Mediterranean convention. This is a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries, including several in the Middle East and the Balkans, where all countries share the same ‘rules of origin’.\n\nFor now, ministers are officially saying that the UK is not interested, but sectoral analysis and some business consultation is ongoing. Trade minister Douglas Alexander left the door open this week by telling MPs that the convention “is an issue that we are open to looking at” and the UK approach would be “pragmatic”.\n\nIt’s complicated. It’s not a silver bullet and will do nothing to address regulatory frictions. But if you want to understand the possibilities (and some of the trade-offs) then a paper by Anna Jerzewska of the consultancy Trade & Borders, is a really clear piece of work on a tricky subject.

    "blurb": "Treasury minister says ‘driving force’ behind new report is to ‘bring to a close’ dispute over tax avoidance crackdown",
    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government has launched a review into the “loan charge” in a bid to “bring to a close” the row over the tax-avoidance crackdown since linked to multiple suicides.\n\nTreasury minister James Murray told the Financial Times that the impetus behind the review, announced on Thursday, was to resolve outstanding tax debts related to avoidance schemes.\n\nBut he added that the review, to be led by former HM Revenue & Customs inspector Ray McCann, would also “maintain fairness [to] the public purse” and other taxpayers who had not engaged in tax avoidance.\n\n“Some of the people affected by the loan charge find it hard to imagine a way out of this situation they’re in . . . For me trying to resolve and bring the matter to a close for them is a driving force for this review,” Murray said in an interview ahead of the announcement.\n\nIn 2019, the then-Conservative government introduced the “loan charge” in an attempt to clamp down on “disguised remuneration” schemes, which involved workers across a range of sectors being paid in loans via offshore trusts and had proliferated in the previous two decades.\n\nHMRC has previously said about 50,000 people were estimated to be affected by the loan charge and that users’ income was “on average twice as much as the average UK taxpayer”.\n\nThe loan charge originally required people affected to pay tax on up to 20 years of income in one financial year, sparking a public outcry and accusations that the government was issuing unreasonable demands.\n\nThe previous Tory administration later softened the policy, halving the 20-year timeframe and making it easier to spread repayments.\n\nBut six years on from the policy’s launch, tens of thousands of people have yet to settle their affairs with HMRC. The tax authority has reported that the policy has been linked to at least 10 suicides and 13 attempted suicides.\n\nLabour committed to a new independent review of the loan charge before the general election last year. A previous report by Lord Amyas Morse in 2019 was criticised by MPs and campaigners for involving Treasury and HMRC officials.\n\nMurray said the government had “gone to some lengths” to ensure public confidence in the review, which will run until the summer and be staffed by civil servants who have no connection with or experience working on loan charge policy. They will work in a building separate to the Treasury.\n\nMcCann, a former president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said he was “pleased to be asked to help find ways” to resolve the dispute.\n\nMcCann previously criticised how HMRC has sought to engage with loan charge campaigners, noting that “all the people [within the agency] who are working on loan schemes could be working on customer service”.\n\nIn a statement, the government said the review would probe “the barriers preventing those subject to the loan charge from reaching resolution with HMRC and recommend ways in which they can be encouraged to do so”.\n\nCampaigners who have demanded a wide-ranging probe — looking at the role of scheme developers, umbrella companies, recruitment agencies, accountants and tax advisers who recommended the schemes, as well as HMRC — hit out at the announcement.\n\nSteve Packham, of the Loan Charge Action Group, said the proposed review was “a betrayal” and would “not resolve the matter”.\n\n“We are deeply worried about the impact on mental health that the announcement of this sham non-review will have,” he added.\n\nMurray said his meetings with loan charge campaigners last year had alerted him to the policy’s impact and that the government wanted the McCann review, to which it will respond by the autumn Budget, to “provide a way for taxpayers affected to come to a settlement”.\n\nDespite some asking “for a review with a different scope”, Murray added that his priority was “to help those people who feel stuck”.",

    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK Competition and Markets Authority is planning to cut staff numbers by close to 10 per cent following a “budgeting error”, as the agency reels from the ousting of its chair by the government.\n\nChief executive Sarah Cardell told staff at a town-hall meeting in December that the CMA was starting a voluntary exit scheme to cut staff numbers by about 100 because of an overspend, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nCardell referred to the overspend as a “budgeting error”, the people said. The CMA has a total headcount of nearly 1,200 and its budget from the Treasury for this year is £139mn.\n\nAt another town hall meeting on Monday, Cardell said certain areas of the agency, such as mergers and the new digital markets unit, would be protected from the cuts, the people said.\n\nThe watchdog was seeking to avoid forced job cuts by starting with voluntary departures, one of the people added.\n\nThe cuts come as the regulator has found itself in the Labour government’s crosshairs, with CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink ousted this week by ministers after complaints from business about the regulator.\n\nMinisters wanted to send a signal to the CMA and other independent regulators that the government wanted to prioritise growth, according to officials.\n\nBokkerink’s exit has led antitrust lawyers and lobbyists to question whether the CMA will now take a softer approach towards Big Tech. Bokkerink has been replaced in the interim by former Amazon UK head Doug Gurr.\n\nIn a staff meeting on Thursday, Cardell sought to reassure employees that they did not need to be concerned about Bokkerink’s departure and that the government had given assurances of its confidence in the agency, one person said.\n\nWhile the staff exit scheme was in train before Bokkerink’s ousting, some employees are concerned that in light of the government’s frustration with the agency there could be further staff reductions.\n\nStaff numbers at the antitrust regulator have grown considerably over the past eight years from about 600 staff in 2017 to 1,185 as of October 2024, according to the most recent disclosure.\n\nThe CMA has expanded its presence from London to a number of hubs across the UK. Part of the growth is down to its suite of powers under the new digital markets regime, which came into effect this month, and led to the creation of the digital markets unit at the agency to enforce it.\n\nUnder the new regime, the CMA will designate a number of Big Tech companies with a large presence in certain digital markets as having “strategic market status” and force them to abide by certain conduct rules.\n\nGoogle and Apple became the first companies this month to face investigations to determine if they should be handed the status.\n\nThe CMA said: “This is an historic budget issue which has been addressed swiftly and appropriately. The CMA is fully focused on its priorities for the coming year including working with the government and the new interim chair to help deliver growth.”\n\nThe Treasury said it was “aware of this historic issue and worked with the CMA last year to resolve it”, adding: “We are now moving forward with the second part of spending review discussions, as we are with all government departments.”",

    "body": "J Sainsbury is axing 3,000 jobs, including senior managers, as the UK’s second-largest supermarket chain accelerates cost-cutting after the Labour government increased taxes on employers in its October Budget.\n\nThe redundancies, which amount to 2 per cent of the group’s workforce, will result from the closure of its 61 remaining in-store cafés and sweeping changes at management level.\n\nAbout 20 per cent of senior management roles are expected to be axed, Sainsbury’s said on Thursday.\n\nThe decision comes after dozens of large UK retailers, including Sainsbury’s, warned in November that the higher costs arising from the Budget would feed through into job losses and higher prices for customers.\n\nThe move by one of the UK’s biggest private-sector employers will make for awkward timing for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is meanwhile attempting to woo business leaders and foreign investors at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nMore than half of UK retailers said they would reduce the number of hours for their workers, as well as head-office headcount, according to a survey of finance chiefs earlier this month by the British Retail Consortium.\n\nSainsbury’s job cuts follow an announcement by the company last year that it would cut a further £1bn in costs over the next three years.\n\nThe reorganisation also comes amid what chief executive Simon Roberts called “a particularly challenging cost environment” as retailers battle rising costs and taxes.\n\nThe retail sector has forecast bigger annual costs of up to £7bn, largely stemming from increases in national insurance contributions and the national living wage.\n\nSainsbury’s is facing a £140mn hit to its tax bill from the Budget. Some of the changes to its workforce were partly driven by this, according to one person familiar with the decision.\n\nIn October, Reeves announced that the rate of employers’ national insurance contributions would rise 1.2 percentage points to 15 per cent from April while the earnings threshold at which the tax kicks in would be reduced from £9,100 to £5,000.\n\nThe minimum wage is also set to rise, adding to employers’ cost pressures.\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: “This news from one of Britain’s biggest retailers is devastating but no surprise. Thanks to Labour’s budget 3,000 jobs will be lost and 3,000 families will suffer without the security of regular pay.”\n\nThe grocery chain said it was overhauling the structure of its central management teams “to support faster decision making and drive performance” at both Sainsbury’s and Argos, which is also owned by the group.\n\nThis would lead to fewer, bigger head office roles with clearer accountability, the company said, adding that the changes would take effect in coming months.\n\nRoberts said the business “had to make tough choices about where we can afford to invest and where we need to do things differently to make our business more efficient and effective”.\n\nClive Black, head of consumer research at Shore Capital, said Sainsbury’s had unveiled “further, increasingly necessary steps post the autumn Budget, to manage its cost base to enable ongoing investment”.\n\n“Whilst very difficult, such steps are necessary to us, especially in the face of very considerable UK government-sourced cost expansion,” he added.\n\nSeparately, the finance chief of Associated British Foods, which owns fashion chain Primark, warned that consumers were holding back from buying clothes partly because of increasing uncertainty over the security of their jobs.\n\nOn Thursday, the company blamed cautious consumers in its core UK market as it cut Primark’s sales forecast for 2025.\n\nChief financial officer Eoin Tonge said “other businesses — not us — start to talk about employment levels and recruitment, and the recruitment of temporary workers” and “the spectre of unemployment seems to rise”, having a knock-on impact on consumer sentiment.\n\nHe added: “We’re seeing, especially in those lower income brackets, consumers being more [selective] around their purchasing habits.\n\n“We need a different narrative, we need more upbeat, positive, front-foot narrative to get some energy back into the system.”",

    "body": "Rachel Reeves is set to make a change to the UK government’s crackdown on non-domiciled residents in an attempt to allay concerns about the tax reforms announced in October’s Budget.\n\nThe chancellor told a fringe event at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday that the government would soon table an amendment to its own finance bill.\n\nThis will enable easier access to the temporary repatriation facility, which allows non-doms to bring foreign income and gains made before April 2025 into the UK and pay tax at a discounted rate of 12 per cent in the 2025-26 and 2026-27 tax years, rising to 15 per cent in 2027-28 — compared with the maximum income tax rate of 45 per cent.\n\nThe change planned by the government would make it easier for certain funds to access the facility’s flat tax rates. But while the measure may be useful for some non-doms, it is unlikely to move the dial for many.\n\nReeves said at The Wall Street Journal’s Davos event on Thursday the government had been “listening to the concerns that have been raised by the non-dom community”, responding to a question about an increase in the net number of millionaires leaving the UK in recent months.\n\nBusiness secretary Jonathan Reynolds later confirmed the planned change, first reported by The Times, telling journalists in the Swiss mountain resort: “There is a tweak to the finance bill . . . when you’re changing a tax regime, people will want to know, and there’ll be some uncertainty there, so we’ve got to get that message out.”\n\nReeves announced in the Budget that she was abolishing the non-dom regime, which allows UK tax residents whose permanent home or “domicile” is overseas to avoid paying British tax on their foreign income or capital gains for 15 years.\n\nIt will be replaced from April 6 2025 by a four-year residence-based scheme to offer “internationally competitive arrangements for people coming to the UK on a temporary basis”.\n\nDowning Street said the change would not lead to a fall in the tax take from replacing the non-dom regime, and the Treasury still expects to raise £33.8bn over the next five years from the reforms.\n\nNon-doms have been most concerned about changes to inheritance tax on existing trusts, with the issue often mentioned as the key factor driving them to leave the country.\n\nRachel de Souza, tax partner at RSM UK, said that while an increase to the temporary repatriation facility was “a good move”, it was “woefully inadequate” to prevent wealthy non-doms from leaving the UK.\n\n“The way to stem this exodus would be to maintain the exemption from IHT to offshore trusts, but also reverse the proposed changes to agricultural and business property relief which impacts the farmers and entrepreneurs.”\n\nRobert Brodrick, a partner at law firm Payne Hicks Beach, said: “It’s reassuring to see that they are at last responding to the concerns of the many people who are affected by this, but I don’t think this is going to be enough to stem the tide . . . It’s helpful but the inheritance tax exposure is the biggest nail in the coffin.”\n\nThe chancellor also said on Thursday she wanted to allay concerns from countries including India that the rules changes would not affect double-taxation agreements: “That’s not the case: we are not going to be changing those double-taxation conventions.”\n\nA Treasury figure said: “We’re always interested in hearing ideas for making our tax regime more attractive to talented entrepreneurs and business leaders from around the world to help create jobs and wealth in the UK.”",

    "body": "UK ministers are looking at joining an EU trade arrangement with neighbouring countries as part of post-Brexit “reset” talks which begin in earnest this year, as Brussels confirmed it would be open to the idea.\n\nMaroš Šefčovič, the EU’s trade chief who is leading talks with Britain, said on Thursday a “pan-European [customs] area is something we could consider” as part of talks between London and Brussels.\n\nŠefčovič referred in a BBC interview to the idea of Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention, a customs agreement between the EU and 20 countries, including several in the Middle East and the Balkans, where all countries share the same “rules of origin”.\n\nUK trade minister Douglas Alexander hinted at the possibility of Britain joining PEM when he told MPs this week: “It’s something we are open to looking at. We want to take a pragmatic view on where the national interest lies.”\n\nHowever, officials said that discussions of the idea within government are at an early stage. Alexander told the House of Commons’ business and trade committee: “There are some stakeholders who would argue there would be disadvantages to some business sectors in the UK.”\n\nThe rules of origin in trade deals require exporters to demonstrate their products are sufficiently locally made, usually about 45 per cent, to qualify for tariff-free access to the market.\n\nUnder the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the UK agreed a set of rules of origin with the EU. But joining PEM would allow UK companies to use inputs from those countries in their supply chains in order to be able to export goods into the EU tariff-free.\n\nJoining PEM would not, however, remove other elements of red tape, such as veterinary certificates, licences and some compliance documents.\n\nAsked about the idea on the BBC Today programme, housing minister Matthew Pennycook said: “As for this particular arrangement, we’re not seeking to participate in it at the present time.”\n\nThe idea of Britain joining PEM has been promoted by Labour MP Stella Creasy. “Red tape from Brexit hits British business in many ways,” she said.\n\n“Joining PEM would help cut the paperwork connected to rules of origin requirements which is why we have long argued it should be a priority for the UK as one way to undo the damage to trade leaving the EU has done.”\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce, the trade association, has said the government should consider rejoining the convention on the basis it “could provide additional flexibility” to businesses trading with the EU.\n\n“The UK should propose rejoining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention to offer greater cumulation in rules of origin for manufacturers,” the group said in its 2023 trade manifesto, based in part on survey data from members.\n\nIndustry insiders also said the government had been consulting some sectors over whether they would benefit from joining PEM, but added that no decisions had been made and quantitative analysis of the pros and cons was still needed in Whitehall.\n\nSince the signing of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the EU has indicated that it would be open to the UK joining PEM in the absence of a decision by London to rejoin a full-blown customs union.",

    "body": "Good morning. The biggest story in Westminster this week? The British government has revealed that the Russian spy vessel Yantar had been tracked in the English Channel. (Our story is here.)\n\nDonald Trump’s posts over on his social media network, Truth Social, have raised hopes that he will not, as feared, force Ukraine into a peace deal that leaves Kyiv worse off and Europe’s security at risk.\n\nI’m not going to pretend to be versed either in the ins and outs of naval espionage or Trump’s thinking: but one way or the other all of this further tightens the government’s room for manoeuvre when it comes to fiscal policy. Some more thoughts on that below.\n\nThe future is unwritten, but it is likely that over the next year the British government will have to navigate either a still more acrimonious relationship with Vladimir Putin’s Russia and an unreliable US president. In all likelihood, I think it will face both. It just seems probable that there will be direct consequences for the UK from some kind of disaster that comes out of the Trump presidency. As Janan Ganesh writes in his column this week:\n\nAll of which is going to put further pressure on government spending. I know I am becoming a stuck record on this, but it remains true: the UK has a rising number of old people, which puts upward pressure on health spending. And the UK faces a highly uncertain global backdrop which increases upward pressure on defence spending.\n\nNow, you can also spend money in a smarter way — over at Reform (the think-tank, not the political party), Rosie Beacon has a smart blog about what the government should be doing on hospital building. And if you modernise and improve the UK’s defence procurement then your money will go further.\n\nBut neither the health nor defence department is going to be able to deliver what it needs to on reform alone. In a terrific column, Chris Giles sets out the big challenge for Rachel Reeves (that the UK hasn’t run a budget surplus for nearly a quarter of a century). There is a reward to be had for the Labour administration if it can demonstrate it has a path to doing so at a time when few governments can. But both the party’s MPs and Labour voters want and expect improvements to public services.\n\nReeves and Keir Starmer hope that “growth” can sand off some of those edges, which is part of why the chancellor is making such warm noises about a controversial third runway at the UK’s largest airport. But I think it’s the other way around: we’ve stress tested whether you can meet British voters’ expectations of the state and control public spending through spending cuts. The Labour government must make tough choices on raising income tax on “ordinary” taxpayers, and difficult choices on reforming public services to do more with fewer public sector workers (staff being among the biggest of the government’s costs).\n\nReforming planning and trying to shift the balance in how UK regulators balance risk and return are important steps. But such moves on their own are not going to give the government a way out of overseeing a series of difficult budgets if they want to achieve the fiscal consolidation, improved security and a better running NHS that are vital both to their own electoral prospects and to the UK’s hopes of a better tomorrow.\n\nI am really enjoying Joe Hisaishi’s second symphony, which you can listen to here.",

    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "For a Labour chancellor it was a bold move: Rachel Reeves went to Davos and told an audience of global plutocrats that she wanted to make their lives easier by creating a riskier regulatory environment for UK consumers.\n\nFar away from the Swiss Alps, Reeves’ offensive against regulators was cheered on by right-wing Conservatives, but some Labour MPs despaired that their chancellor’s quest for growth was taking the party into dangerous territory.\n\n“People are holding their heads in disbelief,” said one senior Labour MP.\n\nReeves, speaking at the World Economic Forum, was adamant: “You have got to get the balance right. I think the balance has moved too far in regulating for risk. You have got to be able to protect consumers but people should be able to take risks as well.”\n\nMarcus Bokkerink, chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, on Tuesday became the highest-profile casualty of Reeves’ new approach, as ministers forced him out of his job over his allegedly lukewarm appetite for growth-focused reforms.\n\nHis sacking was intended to serve as a warning to other regulators, according to government officials. This month, Reeves demanded that 17 watchdogs produce action plans to boost growth and has warned them she will be watching.\n\nJohn McDonnell, former Labour shadow chancellor, said Reeves could hand a propaganda victory to Nigel Farage, leader of the populist Reform UK party, if she aggressively pursued her agenda at the expense of consumers.\n\n“I’m becoming increasingly worried that this will all provide our opponents, in particular Reform, the opportunity to portray the Labour party as defending corporate abuse and profiteers,” he said.\n\nReeves’ efforts to protect business from what is seen in government circles as a damaging “compensation culture” has taken many forms in recent months, with a common theme: less money for allegedly wronged consumers.\n\nThis week, Reeves sought to intervene in a Supreme Court case to shield banks and other car loan providers from multibillion-pound payouts in a landmark mis-selling case, arguing that it would “adversely affect the UK’s reputation as a place to do business”.\n\nLast year, the Treasury successfully put pressure on regulators to slash a proposed compensation limit for victims of payment fraud from £415,000 to £85,000, amid fears the new regime could seriously damage some fintech companies.\n\nReeves has also pushed for a review of the Financial Ombudsman Service to prevent more mass consumer compensation events, such as the £50bn paid out by banks over the payment protection insurance scandal.\n\nThe Conservatives find themselves in a curious position, egging Reeves on to push further with an agenda that began in 2023 under Rishi Sunak, when regulators were given a “secondary objective” to promote economic growth and competitiveness.\n\nAndrew Griffith, shadow business secretary, wants to see a broader clearout of regulators and has been a critic of the Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog. He thought sacking Bokkerink was “a curious place to start”.\n\nBim Afolami, former Tory City minister, said: “The chancellor is doing exactly the right thing on the regulators. My advice to her is to keep going.” Another former Tory Treasury minister said simply: “I think she is probably right.”\n\nBut Conservatives also believe Reeves, presiding over a stagnant economy, is using regulators as a scapegoat. Harriett Baldwin, a senior Tory, said the chancellor should “acknowledge some of her own mistakes rather than blaming everyone else”.\n\nGiven that Sir Keir Starmer’s government is in the process of introducing a wave of employment regulation, many business leaders agree with the Tory critique that deregulation should start closer to Number 10. Ministers may yet water down that package.\n\nRegulators say that in return for focusing on growth, Reeves has given a clear signal she will stand by regulators when things go wrong — as they inevitably will. “We feel she has our backs now,” said one.\n\nNikhil Rathi, FCA chief executive, told the House of Lords on Wednesday that proposed rule changes — such as easing controls on mortgage lending — could lead to more defaults. “One or two things are going to go wrong here,” he said, arguing that parliament should give the watchdog a “metric of tolerable failure”.\n\nConsumer groups have expressed alarm. “The combination of anti-regulation rhetoric — and now the firing of the CMA chair — signals to consumers that the government stands ready to peel back the protections that were built for them,” said James Daley, head of the Fairer Finance research group.\n\nRocio Concha, a director at consumer group Which?, said the government was “absolutely right” to focus on growth and the role of regulators. But she added: “Strong consumer protections are not an impediment to growth. They are vital for economic growth because they help to create level playing fields for dynamic competition, while ensuring consumers are protected from being ripped off.”\n\nProfessor John Thanassoulis of Warwick Business School, who is also an independent CMA panel member, said the government should “resist the temptation to beat up on the CMA”.\n\nHe added: “It will not drive marketwide productivity growth. It will instead reward some well-connected firms to the detriment of the countless, but silent, majority who want a market which is not expensive, which is fair, and whose firms put the consumer first.”\n\nDame Meg Hillier, Labour chair of the Commons treasury committee, said that while she supported Reeves’ aim of pushing regulators to promote growth, it was “critical that economic stability and protections for consumers are not unduly put at risk”.\n\nFor now, most Labour MPs are not mobilising against Reeves. “There’s a bit of muttering about not going back to 2008,” said one Labour grandee, referring to the “light touch” regulatory landscape before the financial crisis. “But it’s not in the mainstream of the party yet — it’s still seen as a bit niche.”",

    "body": "Elon Musk has privately downplayed the chances of making a donation to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, telling an associate it would not be easy to give money to the British party after he joined the US government.\n\nThe associate said Musk told them earlier this month that Donald Trump’s inauguration would complicate his ability to donate to Reform because of the tech billionaire’s role running a waste-cutting unit in the new administration.\n\nThough Musk met Farage in December at Mar-a-Lago, the pair did not meet again when the Reform leader travelled to Washington, DC, for Trump’s inauguration, said two people familiar with the matter.\n\nMusk has dramatically intervened in UK politics in recent months, proclaiming Reform as the country’s “only hope” and frequently criticising Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nLast month, Farage said the X owner and Tesla boss was giving “serious thought” to a donation to Reform. The UK’s lax rules on political donations allow foreign-owned entities — such as Musk’s X subsidiary in the UK — to give unlimited amounts to British parties.\n\nBut the pair have since clashed over Musk’s support for the far-right agitator and convicted criminal Tommy Robinson, who is in prison for contempt of court in relation to Robinson’s libel of a Syrian refugee.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk called for Farage to be replaced as leader of Reform, posting on X that the veteran politician did not “have what it takes”, and suggesting alternatives, including Rupert Lowe, another Reform MP.\n\nFarage has cultivated ties with Trump, appearing at his rallies in the past. Though he was not invited to the Capitol Rotunda for Monday’s ceremony, he did attend several parties around the event, including an official post-inauguration ball.\n\nMusk did not attend an inauguration party hosted by Brexit-backing businessmen Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore — allies of Farage — in Washington on Friday, sending a close associate instead.\n\nMusk has been tasked by Trump with leading the cost-cutting “Department of Government Efficiency”, or DOGE, which will sit inside an existing federal agency.\n\nThere is no US law preventing Musk from contributing financially to Reform, and he still may decide to make a donation. However, a financial gift by a senior figure within the Trump administration to a British opposition party would potentially generate diplomatic tensions between the US and UK, which are close allies.\n\nSpeculation that Musk could make a donation of up to $100mn, following a media report in November, has given the UK rightwing party momentum as it rises in the polls and attracts some low-level defections from the Conservatives, the UK’s largest rightwing party and official opposition.\n\nA spokesperson for Reform confirmed that Musk had not made a donation to date, and said: “We have a good relationship with Elon Musk and will continue to do so.” Musk did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "The number of young people admitted to general hospital wards in England with a mental health concern jumped 65 per cent in the 10 years to 2022, according to research that suggests thousands of children may not be receiving the specialist care they need.\n\nThe surge in admissions of those aged five to 18 for mental health — from 24,198 to 39,925 — compared with a 10 per cent increase in “all cause” admissions between 2012 and 2022, according to the study published on Wednesday.\n\nAround the world, most countries have been grappling with big rises in demand for mental healthcare, an issue thrown into sharp relief by the coronavirus pandemic. The substantial increase in patients in England comes as the NHS is struggling to meet record demand across its services.\n\nThe researchers at University College London said their findings “provide important messages for health policy internationally on delivering care for children and young people admitted in acute settings due to mental health concerns”.\n\nIncreases in mental health admissions in England were biggest among girls between the ages of 11 and 15, rising from 9,091 to 19,349, or by about 113 per cent, said the study, the first to analyse national trends in acute medical wards.\n\nA surge of almost 515 per cent in admissions related to eating disorders was one of the biggest drivers behind the overall increase, according to the paper in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal.\n\nThe researchers also identified steep rises in the admission of children between the ages of five and 10, “with striking rates of self-harm in females” in this group, although absolute numbers were still low.\n\nLee Hudson, senior author of the study and clinical associate professor at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said acute medical wards were important places for caring for young people with mental health concerns, especially those who also had physical health problems such as starvation from an eating disorder.\n\n“However, the increased intensity we describe is presenting real challenges for acute wards, both for patients and their families and the staff supporting them,” he said.\n\nThe researchers cited recent findings from the Health Services Safety Investigations Body, an arms-length body, that in 13 of 18 paediatric units surveyed, the ward environment was “not safe” for caring for children and young people with “high-risk behaviours related to mental health concerns”.\n\nThe researchers suggested that while Covid-19 had contributed to deteriorating mental health among young people, annual increases were registered across the entire 10-year period they had studied.\n\nFurther work was needed “to examine how trends have evolved as the pandemic has subsided, although early data suggest there has not been a reduction to pre-pandemic levels”, they added.\n\nIn an attempt to protect mental health expenditure, all of NHS England’s integrated care boards, which manage budgets in different parts of the country, are at present required to ensure investment in mental health rises at a faster rate than their overall budget.\n\nBut Hudson called for “better co-working between physical and mental health professionals across hospital and community teams, including, for example, adequate provision of psychiatrists and mental health trained nurses to support physical medical care on the actual ward”.\n\nResearchers did not reach a firm conclusion as to whether difficulty in accessing support at an earlier stage in the community, before mental health problems escalated, was partly to blame for the soaring admissions.\n\nBut “a population-level increase in mental health conditions” had emerged clearly from the data, Hudson added.\n\nClaire Murdoch, NHS England’s national mental health director, said treatment and awareness of such conditions had vastly improved over the past decade, “but that also means the health service is treating record numbers as well as dealing with new issues like the negative impact and pressures that social media has on body image”.\n\nThe NHS had rolled out hundreds of mental health teams in schools and set up 24/7 crisis support “but sometimes an admission to hospital is in the person’s best interest” to reduce the risk of harm, she said. Despite the rise in demand for services dealing with eating disorders, more than four-fifths of children started urgent treatment within a week, Murdoch added.\n\n",

    "body": "Brussels has proposed extending EU banks’ access to UK derivatives clearing houses for another three years in a victory for the City of London.\n\nThe European Commission on Wednesday announced it had introduced a new “equivalence decision”, which would allow banks and other financial institutions in the bloc to use some of the world’s most critical market utilities in London until June 2028.\n\nEU politicians have sought to capture the lucrative euro-denominated clearing industry since the Brexit vote in 2016 but have accepted its financial system still depends on the UK, which dominates the global business of derivatives clearing.\n\nClearing houses reduce market risk by standing between two parties in a trade.\n\nLondon frequently handles deals nominally worth about $3.5tn a day. It is a global centre for trading interest rate derivatives and Brent crude oil, with clearing of deals handled at London Stock Exchange Group’s LCH and at Intercontinental Exchange.\n\nEuropean derivatives traders had lobbied hard to extend the City’s permit, which expires on June 30 after three years. Member states have five days to object to the commission’s proposal to let it run until June 2028, but such opposition was highly unlikely, officials said.\n\nThe commission said UK-based clearing houses were vital to its plans to build a single market in savings and investments.\n\n“Two [clearing houses in the] UK have been identified by the European Securities and Markets Authority as systematically important for the EU’s financial stability,” said Olof Gill, spokesman for financial services, referring to LCH and ICE.\n\n“An extension of the equivalence decision is therefore needed to avoid any risks to our financial stability in the short term, and give certainty and clarity to EU financial market participants,” he added.\n\nBut he added that Brussels was committed to building up a rival industry. Last year it approved an updated European Market Infrastructure Regulation that will oblige EU banks to hold “active accounts” at EU-based clearing houses for some products, and if users cross minimum thresholds in others.\n\nThe regulation “contains measures that will improve the attractiveness and competitiveness of EU clearing markets. This will help reduce in the medium term the EU’s overreliance on UK clearing houses,” said Gill.\n\nPascal Kerneis, of the European Services Forum, which represents services companies trading internationally, welcomed the move.\n\n“It will give a clearer perspective to operators in the EU financial market in the medium term.\n\n“This will also give a good political signal for a proper ‘reset’ of the EU-UK relationship,” he said.\n\nThe two sides have begun talks to improve trade ties. UK chancellor Rachel Reeves met her EU counterparts in December and called for them to drop barriers to City firms. She said they could boost EU growth by funnelling international investment to the bloc.\n\nClearing is the only part of financial services that has been granted equivalence since Brexit.",

    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Major supermarkets Tesco and Lidl have come out batting for UK farmers, calling for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to pause his inheritance tax reforms or else put the sector’s future at risk.\n\nBritish farmers have taken to the streets in London in recent months to protest against the changes to inheritance tax reliefs announced in the October Budget, which will end decades of exemption from death duties.\n\nThe reforms mean landowners will from April 2026 be subject to a 20 per cent levy on agricultural land above a threshold of between £1.3mn and £3mn, depending on whether they are married and if they own a home.\n\nAshwin Prasad, Tesco’s chief commercial officer, on Wednesday said the UK’s biggest supermarket “fully understand[s]” concerns raised by “many smaller farms” that were reliant on agricultural property relief and business property relief.\n\n“We’ll be supporting the National Farmers Union’s calls for a pause in the implementation of the policy, while a full consultation is carried out,” he added. “This is not just a debate about individual policies — the UK’s future food security is at stake.”\n\nLidl said it was “concerned that the recent changes to the IHT regime will impact farmer and grower confidence and hold back the investment needed to build a resilient, productive and sustainable British food system”.\n\nMeanwhile, Co-op Dairy Group, a group of milk suppliers, told members in a letter that it had “directly contacted relevant government departments to communicate our hope that they will look again at the impact of the . . . changes” and said it backed calls to pause implementation of the policy.\n\nSupermarkets themselves have drawn fire from farmers, with tractors this month parked at a number of major retailers around the country to raise awareness of the impact of the tax changes. On 16 January, supermarket Morrisons was granted a High Court injunction to block further protests.\n\nPrior to the October Budget, farm campaign groups slammed supermarkets for squeezing their margins with low food prices and undercutting them by not backing homegrown produce.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a short costing of the IHT policy, estimating that it would raise an extra £500mn for the Treasury annually between 2027 and 2029, in line with the government’s estimates.\n\nBut the fiscal watchdog noted that receipts would probably taper off after seven years as farmers increasingly gifted their properties to children and modified their tax planning strategies.\n\nThe OBR also suggested that it would be “more difficult for some older individuals to quickly restructure their affairs” in terms of inheritance planning to adjust to the new measures.\n\nVictoria Atkins, Conservative shadow environment secretary, said the government had “chosen to destroy British family farming for little return. The OBR is clear that it will be near impossible for older farmers to restructure their affairs quickly in response to this vindictive tax.”\n\nFarmers say the sector was struggling with the pressures of climate change, real-term cuts to subsidies, high inflation, wafer-thin margins and the prospect of increased competition as the UK strikes post-Brexit trade deals before chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the IHT changes.\n\nThe exemption was introduced in the 1980s to allow farms to remain in the same family after the death of an owner, a trend that many have warned will become much harder. However, it has helped push up the price of fields as wealthy individuals have bought agricultural land as a form of legal tax avoidance.\n\nFarmers looking to pass on their estate, and their spouses, are each eligible for £1mn of relief before they start paying IHT on their land, on top of the usual inheritance allowances.\n\nGiven that couples already enjoy a threshold of £1mn on their estates that means that two spouses would enjoy a threshold nearer to £3mn, officials have noted.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Our reform to agricultural and business property reliefs will mean estates will pay a reduced effective inheritance tax rate of 20%, rather than standard 40%, and payments can be spread over 10 years, interest free.\n\n“This is a fair and balanced approach, which fixes the public services we all rely on, affecting around 500 estates next year.”",

    "blurb": "Universities are the cornerstone of the country’s reputation as a global research hub but the business model is in crisis",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "The writer is an honorary professor at UCL and former CEO of Digital Catapult\n\nThere has been much excitement at the UK government’s plan to invest in artificial intelligence. The country’s reputation as a global research and talent developer is proof of the immense contributions made by our leading universities. However, recent economic and social changes have put the business model of universities in crisis. This threatens their ability to maintain the country’s reputation for developing AI pioneers such as Alex Kendall of Wayve and Sir Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind.\n\nFunding PhDs is a cornerstone of our track record. Unfortunately, PhD students with UK Research and Innovation funding in the UK fell under the previous government from 6,835 in 2018-19 to 4,900 in 2022-23, according to Times Higher Education.\n\nThe flow of gifted researchers from around the world is a key revenue driver for our leading research universities. For one thing, UK universities are heavily reliant on these students to deliver teaching. The average stipend for a UK PhD student is around £20,000. These low-paid PhD candidates therefore bring enormous value to the UK. Quite simply, without a healthy PhD student population in this country, our capacity to deliver university teaching and carry out research will collapse.\n\nBetter still, talented PhD students and their start-ups are the hunting ground of global technology companies, attracting investment into the UK. The research that these individuals deliver under the tutelage of established academics is producing the foundational algorithms that play a key role in the global AI revolution.\n\nIf that hunting ground dries up because the flow of PhD students declines, big global tech players will look elsewhere. International academics will give up and move abroad. The economic value of our universities will decline in turn.\n\nThis is a challenge that UK universities have been facing since Brexit, which reduced the number of international students from the EU, and the previous government’s* lack of industrial strategy.\n\nThe truth is that the business model of universities is poorly understood by many in government, even those who fund the sector. The majority of the population tends to only think about universities as places that teach undergraduates. But the engine of their innovation, growth and value lies in the work that is delivered by postgraduates, both PhDs and postdoctoral researchers.\n\nThese two areas are rarely examined together. Their funding is divided. The Office for Students is an independent non-departmental public body that reports to the Department for Education. It manages the viability of undergraduate teaching programmes and certifies degree-awarding powers in England. It also distributes an average annual budget of about £1bn in grants. But research, development and innovation are funded by UKRI, a separate body overseen by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. Because they are split apart, it has been rare for anyone in government to look at the whole model.\n\nToo often the disbursement of PhD funding is driven by the politics of levelling up — redistributing funds to underperforming and neglected regions. This leaves the powerhouses of research and innovation that have brought significant economic benefit to the UK struggling to remain viable. Indeed, the whole innovation landscape is littered with different kinds of institutions attempting to collaborate despite various layers of regulation and governance policies that in effect keep them apart.\n\nGovernment tech adviser Matt Clifford’s excellent AI action plan references many of the technology’s opportunities for the country. But if we really want to build an AI growth programme for the UK over the long term, then we need to realise that the UK university business model is in urgent need of reform.\n\nWe can learn much from the way in which US universities such as MIT and Stanford fund their PhD programmes by encouraging greater numbers of external funders to offer scholarships and support. We also need to streamline the academic pipeline from research to development to innovation so that all those involved — from universities to technology centres known as “catapults” to start-ups to major industry — work together and not in competition.\n\nIf the UK is to capitalise on its existing institutions, we need a root-and-branch examination of PhD funding, including whether the current agencies are optimal for disbursing precious government resources. AI provides a catalyst for change. A new strategy cannot come soon enough.\n\n*an editing error incorrectly identified the industrial strategy as the work of the new government",

    "blurb": "Chancellor set to confirm her support for UK’s largest airport having a third runway ",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK chancellor Rachel Reeves has said the pursuit of growth “trumps” the government’s net zero commitments, as she prepares to signal her support for airport expansion in the London region, including at Heathrow.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the chancellor called growth the UK government’s “number one mission”.\n\nAsked what she would do if faced with a choice between economic growth and the UK’s 2050 net zero target, Reeves said: “If it’s the number one mission, it’s obviously the most important thing.”\n\nHer comments come as the government weighs up backing expansion plans for Luton and Gatwick airports, as well as deciding whether to signal its approval for a controversial third runway at Heathrow.\n\nThe possibility of Heathrow’s expansion threatens to split the cabinet, and will force the government to choose between its stated aims of backing growth and reducing the UK’s carbon emissions.\n\nThe chancellor on Wednesday said the government had already signed off the expansion of City and Stansted airports, which also serve the UK capital, signalling “the commitment of this government to make Britain an important trading nation”.\n\nSpeaking earlier at an event in Davos, Reeves said: “When we say that growth is the number one mission of this government, we mean it. That means it trumps other things.”\n\nShe is expected to signal in a speech next week that the government favours the expansion of Gatwick and Luton airports, whilst reaffirming her support for a third runway at Heathrow.\n\nHeathrow’s expansion was previously opposed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and several senior Labour figures.\n\nSome Whitehall officials believe Reeves is attempting to bounce Starmer into publicly endorsing a third runway. “That’s not my assessment,” said one ally of the prime minister.\n\nStarmer, asked about the issue in the House of Commons on Wednesday, refused to comment on “speculation”, adding: “We as a government are committed to growth. We’re committed to the aviation sector and to our climate obligations.”\n\nReeves’ support for Heathrow’s third runway could be the political signal the airport’s management needs before deciding whether to push ahead with proposals this year — it has been reluctant to revive the scheme without clear political backing.\n\nThe chief executive of British Airways’ owner said it would not back Heathrow expansion unless the government changed how landing charges were set.\n\nLuis Gallego, chief executive of International Airlines Group, said Heathrow’s regulatory model was “not fit for purpose”, as he pointed to the high landing charges the UK’s only hub airport levies on its airlines.\n\n“The government has a growth agenda and we support that . . . but before we talk about Heathrow expansion or redevelopment the situation at Heathrow needs to change,” he told an industry event.\n\nThe UK aviation regulator last year forced Heathrow to slightly lower these charges, to £23.73 per passenger for 2025, but both sides were left dissatisfied.\n\nBA is by far the largest airline at Heathrow thanks to its historic rights to more than 50 per cent of the airport’s landing slots.\n\nThis has allowed the airline to build a highly profitable business, particularly on transatlantic flying. Analysts believe that any major expansion of Heathrow could hurt BA if its rivals gain more slots at the airport.\n\nReeves said any approval of the Heathrow scheme would “have collective cabinet agreement”.\n\nIn the last Commons vote on a third runway at Heathrow in 2018, seven members of the current cabinet voted against it, including Starmer. The others were Ed Miliband, Steve Reed, Lisa Nandy, Darren Jones, Anneliese Dodds and Hilary Benn.\n\nMiliband, who is now climate change secretary, threatened to resign over the issue during Gordon Brown’s government, while London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan is still opposed.\n\nCritics argue airport expansion is incompatible with the UK’s legally binding target to reach net zero carbon emissions, given that aviation is one of the most difficult industries to decarbonise.\n\nDowning Street said this week that it still required a third runway at Heathrow to meet its four tests on carbon emissions, noise, air quality and growth. The issues of local noise and air pollution are considered by experts to be the hardest to meet on the congested west London site.\n\nMeanwhile Reeves, who spent Wednesday meeting bankers and investors in Davos, repeated her backing for aggressive deregulation and the need to clear the way for more building.\n\n“There is always a reason not to invest, not to build,” she said. “There are bats and newts. It might add something to carbon emissions in 20 years' time.”\n\nReeves has been attempting to reassure businesses that the UK has a clear growth plan following a damaging sell-off in government bonds this month.\n\nShe also promised to examine routes for high-skilled workers to come to the UK as the country attempts to attract talented individuals in sectors such as AI and life sciences.\n\nThe government is also drawing up a planning and infrastructure bill designed to speed up projects by making it harder for protesters to secure multiple judicial reviews on the same case.\n\nThe legislation will create a new “nature restoration fund” enabling developers to meet environmental obligations more quickly to accelerate home-building, and will include measures to accelerate the sign-off on projects under the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects regime by cutting paperwork.",

    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Investors in Britain’s motor finance industry slammed on the brakes last October when the Court of Appeals said it was unlawful for lenders to pay “secret” commissions. An unusual intervention by chancellor Rachel Reeves has reduced the risk that the sector becomes a total write-off.\n\nIt is not hard to see why Reeves has asked for permission to get involved in the case. The Supreme Court in April will decide whether lenders should be on the hook for tens of billions of pounds in compensation for historic loan agreements, which they thought to be legal at the time.\n\nThat would spook investors, not least because it is only five years since the saga of mis-sold payment protection insurance ended up costing more than 10 times initial estimates. One £50bn bill could be seen as an aberration, but two in quick succession may start to look like a worrying trend. Even in heavily regulated sectors such as financial services, investors should be able to expect some level of consistency and predictability around the rules.\n\nBanks, too, can argue that they need predictability in order to lend money. Most restarted lending a few days after the October ruling plunged the industry into confusion. But it is difficult to make long-term investment decisions if you live in fear that policies currently considered standard will be retrospectively punished 10 years down the road.\n\nReeves is hardly alone in worrying that squeezing banks too hard could hurt the economy. American lenders squealed after regulators proposed a package of tough new rules known as Basel III, arguing that they would be forced to tighten the lending spigots.\n\nUK banks are still pricing in a hefty slug of risk. Shares in Lloyds Banking Group, which has the UK’s largest car loan book, trade roughly in line with where they were last October — underperforming less-exposed NatWest and Barclays, which climbed 15 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively, over the same period. Close Brothers, which has higher exposure relative to its overall balance sheet, has even more ground to make up.\n\nIt is still too soon to put the foot on the gas — the court will have the final say, and there is a good chance lenders will end up paying at least some level of compensation.\n\nStill, the fact that the Treasury has even tried to intervene could be seen as a positive for the industry more broadly. Few politicians would have dared to defend banks as the PPI scandal was building in the wake of the financial crisis; Reeves’ efforts suggest she is serious about making financial regulation more focused on growth.\n\nnicholas.megaw@ft.com",

    "body": "The head of the UK financial watchdog has called for politicians to define an acceptable level of harm to consumers as he warned more would “go wrong” as a result of Sir Keir Starmer’s demands to slash regulation.\n\nNikhil Rathi, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said on Wednesday the agency’s recent proposal for easing controls on mortgage lending could increase defaults and repossessions of homes.\n\n“On mortgages, [what] if there are more defaults if we relax [rules]?” he told the House of Lords financial regulation committee. “One or two things are going to go wrong here and not everybody is going to play completely by the rule book, and is there acceptance of that?”\n\nThe FCA has also proposed cutting requirements for banks to check customers’ identities in an attempt to prevent money laundering through smaller transactions, after the prime minister called on regulators to suggest rule changes that could increase risk-taking and investment in Britain’s stagnating economy.\n\nBut Rathi said the change could lead to an increase in fraud, warning that “there could be more money mules that get through the system”. He asked how far “we want to trade off lower compliance costs with the fact that some people might abuse the relaxations that come”.\n\nHe called for the FCA to be given a “metric for tolerable failure” by parliament that defines how much consumer harm and financial wrongdoing is acceptable in its push to cut regulation in support of growth and competitiveness.\n\nAccepting this was “hard” to achieve, he asked whether there would be “a range that would be seen as broadly politically acceptable in parliament and we would be able to be held to account on”.\n\nPressure to ease the regulatory burden on the City of London has prompted fears of a return to the “light touch” approach to financial supervision that was blamed for enabling the 2008 banking crisis.\n\nBut FCA chair Ashley Alder told peers that “we are not reverting to light touch”, while also accepting the need to ensure regulations were “proportionate” and properly “calibrated” to their risks.\n\nThe FCA said in its letter to the prime minister, published on Friday, that it would “begin simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and opening a discussion on the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults”.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has backed the proposal, telling the Financial Times this week that she was “absolutely open to looking at ideas that can boost home ownership and help working families get on the housing ladder”.\n\nRathi reminded peers that in 2023 the previous Conservative government had encouraged banks to allow borrowers to reduce their mortgage payments to avoid defaults and home repossessions after interest rates shot up. “That is not going to be compatible with relaxing lending standards,” he said.\n\n“We can see the enormous challenge the country is facing on growth,” he said. “There are any number of things we can do. What we have struggled with in the past is to have a really open conversation about what the risks may be if we go in a particular direction.”\n\nMark Turner, a former official at the watchdog now working at consultants Kroll, said the government’s push to prioritise growth over soundness put the FCA in a “difficult situation” because it was “increasingly ‘damned if they do, damned if they don’t’.”\n\n​Letter in response to this article:\n\nHow the FCA can support government growth goals / From Omar Salem, Partner, Fox Williams LLP, Solicitors, London EC2, UK",

It was boosted further in December 2023 when the then-government said it would not launch a rival.\n\nMark Plowright, director of Trainline rival Virgin Trains Ticketing, said a competitive ticketing industry would “benefit rail passengers across the UK”.\n\n“However, there’s still much more work to be done to simplify rail tickets and make train travel less confusing for passengers,” he said.",

    "blurb": "The chancellor needs to act upon her tough rhetoric if she is to assuage bond markets",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government has been in something of a bind. As the cost of its borrowing has risen since the autumn, the chances of meeting its main self-imposed fiscal rule — to borrow only for investment by the end of the decade — have dwindled. The setback has been met with fierce rhetoric from the government. Whether from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, his chancellor, or their spokespeople, the adjectives to describe the fiscal rules have tended to shuffle between “ironclad” and “non-negotiable”. Their attitude is always “absolutely committed”.\n\nSentiment has improved in UK government bond markets over the past week, but many are yet to be convinced. Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates, is less than impressed, saying that gilts could be heading for a “death spiral”. Of course, this was overblown, but his comments reflect a broader concern in financial markets that a gap exists between tough fiscal rhetoric and the reality of UK budgetary policy — and it far precedes the current Labour government.\n\nWhat is needed to provide the budgetary stability on which the rest of the UK economy can build is therefore simple. No more rhetoric. No more announcements of tighter fiscal policy either now or some time in the future. Instead, Reeves needs to implement the tax increases and spending plans outlined in October without any compromise on when they are due to come into force in April.\n\nThese are sizeable. Along with the large and messy increase in employers’ national insurance, there are continued income tax rises in the form of frozen allowances and far from lavish public expenditure increases. Together, the measures are set to reduce government borrowing significantly. The overall deficit is forecast to fall from 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2024-25 to 3.6 per cent in 2025-26, while the current budget deficit, excluding capital investment, is set to halve from 2 per cent of GDP to 0.9 per cent over the same period.\n\nThis will be an exercise in show, not tell. Reducing borrowing by this much is reasonably rare for UK governments — it will become clear by the summer whether Reeves and her policies are on track. Success would immediately demonstrate a difference between UK fiscal policy and that of similar countries.\n\nIn recent years, US administrations have shown no ability to run a deficit much under 6 per cent of GDP, and there’s no improvement in sight. The European Commission expects the French budget deficit to have exceeded 6 per cent of GDP last year, with little prospect of a political agreement to deliver much improvement. Underlying German public finances are strong, but its economy is weak. And debt levels in the UK, though high, are still far lower than those in Italy.\n\nBond markets often have a mind of their own, but it would be difficult to single out the UK for special punishment if it is the one decent-sized advanced country with the ability to pass legislation to impose fiscal consolidation and actually see it through. This is what Reeves must do. If growth suffers, the Bank of England would be in a strong position to ease monetary policy and offset the fiscal tightening.\n\nThere are no guarantees in the business of persuading financial markets that they have more to lose if they bet against you. The UK government must also hope that consumers begin to spend their recent real income gains and improve growth. It needs to demonstrate that any expansion will come with some recovery in productivity growth. And that the increases in employers’ national insurance must not have a much more damaging impact on jobs and prices than already expected.\n\nNone will be achieved with more speeches about non-negotiable commitments to ironclad fiscal rules.\n\nchris.giles@ft.com",

Stephen Phipson, head of manufacturing lobbying group Make UK, on Wednesday applauded the government’s efforts to make regulation “fit for purpose”.\n\nBut a number of lawyers and lobbyists said Bokkerink’s resignation had come out of the blue.\n\n“To be honest it was a bit of a surprise,” said one business lobbyist. “We’ve been in lots of discussions with the CMA . . . and they seemed to be really getting it and making changes.”\n\nOne antitrust lawyer at a London firm said the move would have a “chilling and intimidating effect” on independent regulators across the country.\n\n“Although in the short term it seems reassuring for business, if competition policy is at the mercy of political fashion it becomes less stable and predictable, which undermines business confidence,” they said.\n\n“It is an extraordinary move by the government to interfere so much in a competition authority,” they added.\n\nBokkerink’s departure raises questions over whether ministers are prioritising the demands of big business over competing priorities such as consumer rights and the environment.\n\nThe government has appointed as new interim CMA chair Doug Gurr, who ran Amazon’s UK business during the company’s tussle with the CMA over its minority investment in Deliveroo, which the regulator ultimately approved in 2020.\n\nOne person said the forced exit looked like a “desperate move from a struggling government” that was trying to win back popularity with business leaders after imposing extra regulations and taxes on corporations in last year’s Budget.\n\nThe move has also led to speculation about the fate of the CMA’s chief executive Sarah Cardell and whether she may also be replaced.\n\nAndrew Griffith, shadow business secretary, told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the Conservative party wanted regulatory reform so businesses “carry less deadweight”.\n\n“But dismissing the non-executive part-time chairman of the CMA seems a curious place to start,” he told the House of Commons. “He’s not responsible for day-to-day decision making at the CMA. That’s the job of the chief executive. Did they aim and miss?”\n\nCardell has been at pains in recent weeks to emphasise that the regulator is taking the government’s growth mandate seriously. In November, Cardell told the FT the agency was planning a review of its merger remedies, signalling more mergers could be approved based on undertakings such as price freezes rather than forcing the divestiture of assets.\n\nOne person familiar with the matter said Cardell had “positive discussions” about her role with ministers since Bokkerink’s resignation”.\n\nMax von Thun, Europe director at the Open Markets Institute, said the CMA had been at the forefront of global efforts to push back against rising market concentration, particularly in the “monopolistic” tech sector.\n\n“The government’s decision to replace the authority’s chair with a former Amazon executive, at a time when a handful of US tech giants are tightening their grip over the future of artificial intelligence, is a major strategic blunder,” he said.\n\nLawyers and competition specialists noted that Clare Barclay, until recently Microsoft UK head and now in another senior role at the company, is chairing the government’s new Industrial Strategy Advisory Council.\n\nIn a two-page statement released on Tuesday night, Bokkerink said he had helped to refocus the CMA to ensure it delivered on empowering “consumers and effective competition — instead of being held back by a few powerful incumbents setting the rules for everyone else”.\n\nBusiness groups welcomed the government’s intervention. Craig Beaumont, executive director at the Federation of Small Businesses, said he hoped the CMA “will now do more on growth”. One banker said the CMA had been seen as an obstacle and the ousting of Bokkerink could be a way to send a message to the regulator’s staff.\n\nHis exit comes as the CMA has been handed new powers to regulate digital markets.\n\nIt announced last week that Google would be the first company the watchdog would investigate to decide if the tech giant warranted a special market status in light of its position in search services, which could see it bound by tougher conduct rules.\n\nThe government is due to issue a “strategic steer” to the CMA in the coming weeks, setting out its priorities for the regulator. However, beyond its desire for the watchdog to focus on growth, it was unclear what Labour actually wanted the CMA to do, lawyers said.\n\n“The government is obviously unhappy with the CMA but doesn’t seem to have concrete views on what’s wrong,” said one senior antitrust lawyer.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ivan Levingston",

    "body": "Britain’s defence minister warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that “we will not shy away from robust action” after telling parliament that a Russian spy vessel had been operating in UK waters for the second time since November.\n\nJohn Healey said the Russian spy ship, Yantar, had been tracked in the English Channel by a warship after loitering over critical undersea infrastructure. A Royal Navy submarine surfaced near the Yantar to warn that its every move had been monitored, he said.\n\n“Let me be clear, this is a Russian spy ship used for gathering intelligence and mapping the UK’s critical underwater infrastructure,” Healey told the House of Commons on Wednesday.\n\n“My message to President Putin is clear,” he said. “We know what you are doing and we will not shy away from robust action to protect Britain.\n\n“We will continue to call out the malign activity that Putin directs, cracking down on the Russian shadow fleet,” Healey added.\n\nYantar, which means amber in Russian, had now left the Strait of Dover and was in Dutch waters, Healey said.\n\nIt was seen off the UK coast in November, when it had then sailed for the Mediterranean, returning to the Channel this week. As well as being warned by the Royal Navy submarine this week, it had been flanked by the frigate HMS Somerset and HMS Tyne, a patrol vessel.\n\nNato allies have stepped up surveillance of critical marine infrastructure to protect it against sabotage attempts after several power pipelines and data cables in the Baltic Sea were damaged recently.\n\nThree ships have damaged underwater Baltic cables and pipelines in the past 15 months, all by dragging their anchors along the seabed.\n\nFinland used a helicopter last month to board and seize the Eagle S, a Cook Islands-registered tanker that was suspected of sabotage as it transported oil from Russia to Egypt.\n\nThe UK has not had to take similar action, although Healey said he had relaxed the rules of naval engagement so that British warships could now get closer to suspicious vessels to inspect what they are doing.\n\n“Like the surfacing of the submarine [this is] specifically to deter and to discourage the sort of activity that we simply don’t want to see in our waters,” Healey said.\n\nHe added that should there be any need to interdict a suspicious vessel the UK would “certainly be ready to take action”.\n\nThe increased western surveillance of suspicious Russian activity is the latest in a series of Nato-sponsored actions designed to bolster the military alliance following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and subsequent acts of sabotage against multiple countries.\n\nLast week, Mark Rutte, Nato’s secretary-general announced a new mission called Baltic Sentry to monitor underwater infrastructure. Consisting of drones, submarines, ship and aircraft, the UK has also activated an AI-assisted computer system to help monitor key areas of interest.\n\nCartography by Steven Bernard",

    "blurb": "Publisher agrees to pay prince ‘substantial damages’ to drop long-running legal claims",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Rupert Murdoch’s UK tabloid newspaper business has apologised to Prince Harry and agreed to pay him “substantial damages” as it admitted for the first time that unlawful activities took place at The Sun.\n\nDavid Sherborne, barrister for the Duke of Sussex, told the High Court in London on Wednesday that News Group Newspapers had offered the prince a “full and unequivocal apology” for intruding into his private life over 15 years until 2011.\n\nThe admissions are a blow to the Murdoch empire 13 years after it shut down the News of the World following a public outcry at phone hacking at the infamous Sunday redtop.\n\nNGN has spent a decade denying any wrongdoing at The Sun, the News of the World’s daily stablemate, even as it paid more than £1bn in costs and settlements to cover almost all of the phone-hacking claims against the company.\n\nThe publisher did not acknowledge any culpability on the part of senior executives in the settlement, which people familiar with the matter said included an eight-figure payout to the prince.\n\nThe deal means the company will avoid what threatened to be a protracted and high-profile court case covering broad allegations of phone hacking and other unlawful activity, as well as claims of a cover-up involving current and former top executives.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex and former Labour deputy leader Lord Tom Watson were the only remaining claimants in the High Court case against NGN.\n\nIn a statement, NGN said it was sorry “for the distress caused to the duke, and the damage inflicted on relationships, friendships and family”, and apologised in particular to the prince for its treatment of Diana, Princess of Wales, his late mother.\n\nThe company said the apology covered “incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun, not by journalists, during the period 1996-2011”. It agreed to pay him “substantial damages”, though terms were not disclosed.\n\nThe company also offered a “full and unequivocal” apology to Watson for “unwarranted intrusion” into his private life by the defunct News of the World between 2009 and 2011, when he served on parliament’s culture, media and sport select committee investigating media malpractice.\n\nIt acknowledged he was placed under surveillance in 2009 by journalists at the Sunday tabloid and also agreed to pay him “substantial damages”. Terms were not disclosed.\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Sherborne, who represented both claimants, described the settlement as a “monumental victory”. Murdoch’s company had been “finally held to account for its illegal actions and its blatant disregard for the law”, he added.\n\nThe settlement will bring considerable relief to some of the Murdoch executives who were expected to be named in the case.\n\nThey include Rebekah Brooks, former editor of The Sun and now chief executive of News UK, and Will Lewis, who previously worked for Murdoch’s UK newspaper business and is now publisher of The Washington Post.\n\nLewis’s position in Murdoch’s news group at the time has been closely scrutinised since he took the helm of the US newspaper more than a year ago.\n\nNGN has always said illegal voicemail interception took place only at the News of the World, which was shut down after it was disclosed that journalists at the paper had hacked the voicemail of murdered British teenager Milly Dowler.\n\nIt had, until Wednesday, made no admission of unlawful activities at The Sun, although it has previously reached financial settlements with individuals about the paper’s activities without any admission of liability.\n\nForcing an admission of fault from NGN has been a primary motivation for the Duke of Sussex, who was facing considerable financial risk in pursuing the case.\n\nThe case was set to be the climax of the prince’s campaign against Britain’s tabloid press, which he blames for the death of his mother, who was chased by paparazzi photographers before her death in a car crash in Paris in 1997.\n\nThe prince previously secured damages of £140,600 from Mirror Group Newspapers and has outstanding claims against Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail.\n\nEmma Jones, board director at campaign group Hacked Off, said the settlement marked a “humiliating day for The Sun and the senior executives at NGN, who have finally admitted that allegations of illegality made against the publisher are true”.\n\n“It is now clear that the public and parliament were lied to by the newspaper and its publisher, as part of the most extraordinary corporate cover-up in living memory,” she added.\n\nThe settlement will mean the need for a further payout by Murdoch’s US broadcaster Fox, which covers all the costs under the terms of the separation of News Corp and 21st Century Fox.\n\nFox, in a similar eleventh-hour deal in 2023, agreed to pay $787.5mn to settle a defamation case in which it was accused by voting machine maker Dominion of broadcasting false accusations of election fraud in the 2020 US presidential election.",

    "event_name": "Am I liable for tax if I sell unwanted goods online?",
    "blurb": "I’m decluttering and using an online selling service to make money",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "My new year resolution for 2025 was to declutter our home before moving house later this year, so I began using an online selling service. However, HM Revenue & Customs’ guidance suggests people who trade second-hand items through online selling services may need to pay tax and register for self-assessment. How much tax will I need to pay if I continue to sell unwanted items online, and is it worth it?\n\nZena Hanks, private wealth partner at Saffery, says online platforms will soon start sharing sales information and the personal data of its users with HMRC. If an individual has sold a certain number of items, generated sales of £1,700 or more, or provided a paid-for service on a website or an app in 2024, they will be contacted by the platform in advance of their personal details and sales information being shared with HMRC. The principles of whether the sale of items or the provision of paid-for services is taxable remains unchanged.\n\nThe sharing of information is a move towards more transparency for the online platforms and underpins HMRC’s efforts to tackle what it perceives to be a tax gap. With that in mind we need to be clear what does and what does not need to be reported to HMRC.\n\nGetting some money back for items no longer needed as part of a declutter is unlikely to qualify as an activity that generates a tax liability for two reasons. Under first principles there is likely to be a cost associated with the original acquisition of the item which would be taken into account when working out if any tax is due. In addition there needs to be an intention to make a profit. In the situation described here there is no suggestion that the sale is being motivated by a profit and it is likely the items sold would not generate sufficient proceeds to generate an overall profit.\n\nYou do however need to report sale activities when you are selling assets at a profit — for example you upcycle furniture, or you source clothes or furniture to sell on at a profit, or if you sell any personal possessions for more than £6,000. There is a reporting requirement if you provide paid-for services for example garden maintenance, dog walking, taxi driving, delivering food. In addition, income and free products received from social influencing may also generate a taxable activity — all of this depends on the numbers involved. If there is sufficient activity and income, that may generate an obligation to report the income details to HMRC and any associated tax will need to be paid.\n\nThe rules on how to tax trading activities haven’t changed and that includes the availability of the £1,000 trading allowance. What has changed is that online platforms are being compelled to provide sales information and the associated sellers’ personal information to HMRC. It is that information that HMRC will use to ensure that those generating income are paying the correct amount of tax. If you are in any doubt you should speak to a professional adviser as soon as possible. If income does need to be reported it is always better that an “unprompted” disclosure is provided to HMRC.\n\nThe management at the local golf club where my student son works part-time have told him that they are struggling to remain profitable, so they will not be replacing anyone who leaves. To ensure that my son keeps his job, could he offer to work as a self-employed contractor who invoices the golf club for hours worked?\n\nRachel Roberts, a partner in the employment and immigration team HCR Law, says the option of offering to work as a self-employed contractor may seem like a good solution but there are key considerations that your son may want to think about. First, and most important, it would not be possible for your son simply to switch from being a part-time employee to self-employed if, in practice, the nature of his role and his duties remain the same.\n\nWhile your son and the club could agree to change the label of his employment, there is a real risk that HMRC would challenge this. HMRC would apply a variety of tests to determine if your son is providing his services as an employee under the “disguise” of self-employment.\n\nThe key difference between whether your son will be treated as a self-employed contractor or an employee is the degree of control the club has over him. For example, if your son is unable to choose his working hours, work for other businesses or appoint someone else to provide the services on his behalf, then there is a high probability that he will be treated by HMRC as an employee. This could have tax implications as HMRC could serve a demand for backdated PAYE and national insurance payments.\n\nEven if your son’s work does meet the criteria needed to be deemed as self-employment, he will need to bear in mind that self-employed contractors accept a higher level of financial risk. Your son would be responsible for filing his own tax returns. There is also a risk of personal liability if your son provides his services directly to the club rather than through an intermediary, such as a limited company.\n\nAnother key consideration is that your son would be offering to give up his employment rights. Self-employed contractors are not afforded the same employment rights as employees. For example, your son would not be eligible for sick pay or holiday pay. The golf club could also terminate any contractual agreement with your son on relatively short notice if his services are not needed.\n\nAt this stage, it might be premature for your son to initiate discussions about working on a self-employed basis, particularly if his sole aim is to keep his job. The good news is that the club is considering alternative options to dismissal, such as freezing recruitment (as you have mentioned).\n\nIf the situation worsens, the club could consider other cost-cutting measures, such as reducing the number of working hours or shifts and possibly even reducing the rate of pay. Depending on how long your son has worked for the club, he could be entitled to a statutory redundancy payment if his role is terminated.\n\nThe opinions in this column are intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional advice.

It must track therefore that sticky above-target inflation is eclipsing all concerns about stagnating growth and debt sustainability — even though it looks increasingly like the opposite must be true.\n\nSo true, in fact, that even Goldman Sachs feels a need to say the market’s got this one wrong:\n\nGoldman economist Sven Jari Stehn and team point to the UK’s December retail sales miss and a likely fourth-quarter deterioration in GDP growth, which they expect to be negative.\n\nAny improvement to come from higher government spending and a decline in the savings rate will be offset by the recent rise in long-term rates, a weakening of household real disposable income growth, trade tensions, and the fading benefit of front-loaded Autumn Budget measures, GS tells clients in a note published overnight.\n\nMeanwhile, job surveys and alternative data such as HMRC’s PAYE payrolls suggest a tougher labour market than presented in the official unemployment statistics, it says.\n\nThe broker also argues that — but for private rents, school fees and water bills — services inflation would be cooling:\n\nGoldman’s forecast is for just 0.9 per cent UK GDP growth this year, which is a lot lower than what’s expected by the consensus (1.3 per cent), the BoE (1.5 per cent) and the OBR (2 per cent).

    "body": "Good morning. Heck of a scoop from Jim Pickard and Suzi Ring last night: government ministers have forced the resignation of Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the Competition and Markets Authority. Doug Gurr was appointed as the CMA’s new interim chair.\n\nI think this is good news for the UK. It’s bad news for readers because it means today’s newsletter features some perhaps excessive detail about how the UK positions itself as “open for business” and the video game industry more broadly.\n\nOne of the more damaging decisions taken in the last parliament was the CMA’s decision to block Microsoft’s $75bn acquisition of video-games maker Activision Blizzard. (The regulator approved a revised Microsoft-Activision deal in October 2023.)\n\nThe “console wars” are an old, old feature of the gaming industry: manufacturers of gaming consoles such as Sony and Microsoft compete for sales by buying and developing exclusive titles for their platforms. It’s part of what encourages video games companies to innovate, both in terms of the hardware of their consoles and the software that runs on it.\n\nThere simply isn’t a god-given right to be able to play Call of Duty on the PlayStation 5 and there is no evidence that the gaming industry will or would have become overly consolidated had future versions of Call of Duty (the jewel in Activision Blizzard’s crown) become exclusive to Microsoft’s X-Box console. Indeed, Microsoft’s whole strategy has been to move away from console exclusives anyway. Phil Spencer, chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, recently hinted to Bloomberg that many of X-Box’s exclusives could expand to PlayStation.\n\nThe CMA’s rationale for blocking the deal relied on assumptions about the spread and ubiquity of cloud-based gaming that went beyond anything dreamt of in the sector. The regulator seemed to base its case on wild and unexpected changes both in how consumers choose video games and consoles and how Microsoft tries to make a profit from gaming.\n\nTo make matters worse, it meant that the UK’s regulator went further than the EU or the US, despite being a much smaller market. Reactions to it in the UK’s tech sector ranged from “frustrated” to “enraged”.\n\nThat isn’t necessarily the fault of its chair, but in making a change at the top, the government has an opportunity to prove that its rhetorical commitment to growth is matched by a serious commitment to getting the right people in place.\n\nI was at The Vicious Circle last night, a brilliant new exhibition to mark this year’s Holocaust Memorial Day.

    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government borrowed far more than expected in December, underlining the scale of the challenge facing chancellor Rachel Reeves as she battles to restore confidence in her fiscal plans and turn around a stagnating economy.\n\nBorrowing — the difference between public sector spending and income — was £17.8bn last month, £10.1bn more than in December 2023, and the third highest in any December on record, data from the Office for National Statistics showed on Wednesday.\n\nIn the first nine months of the fiscal year borrowing was £129.9bn, which was £8.9bn more than in the same period in the previous fiscal year, and the second-highest for the April to December period since monthly records began in January 1993.\n\nThe figures intensify the pressure on Reeves who has sought to reassure investors after the UK’s borrowing costs this month climbed to the highest level since the global financial crisis, threatening her ability to meet a self-imposed fiscal rule in which day-to-day spending is covered by tax receipts.\n\nAlex Kerr, economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: “Against a backdrop of slowing GDP growth and high interest rates, December’s overshoot in borrowing is further disappointing news for the chancellor.”\n\nDecember’s rise was led by an increase in the cost of interest payments on inflation-linked bonds and a one-off payment to repurchase military accommodation.\n\nIt was above the £14.1bn expected by economists polled by Reuters, and the £14.6bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK fiscal watchdog, in its most recent set of projections made in October.\n\nUK borrowing costs have eased since figures last week showed inflation unexpectedly slowed in December, and a global bond sell-off abated.\n\nBut in a sign of the pressure on Reeves, who businesses have blamed for chilling confidence and hitting the labour market with the £40bn of tax increases in the October Budget, she has promised to set out details in coming weeks of a plan to revive growth.\n\nThe OBR, which has to produce two forecasts every financial year, will provide an update on March 26 on whether Reeves is still on track to meet her borrowing rules.\n\nGiven that the Budget gave Reeves just £9.9bn in wriggle room to meet her fiscal rule, Kerr said there was an increasing risk that the chancellor would need to cut spending or raise taxes, and that her headroom had been whittled down to £2bn.\n\nFollowing the release of the figures, Darren Jones, chief secretary to the treasury, said: “Economic stability is vital for our number-one mission of delivering growth, that’s why our fiscal rules are non-negotiable and why we will have an iron grip on the public finances.”\n\nMel Stride, the shadow chancellor, accused the government of “losing control of the finances”, adding that Reeves “needs to get a grip”.\n\nYields on 10-year gilts, which had climbed to a 16-year high this month, in part due to concerns over government borrowing, were little changed at 4.60 per cent. Yields move inversely to prices.\n\nPooja Kumra, a strategist at TD Securities, said the sharp increase in borrowing last month added to the fiscal strains, but that many investors already believed the chancellor would have to either cut spending or raise taxes to ensure she meets her fiscal rule.\n\nSterling, which was swept up in the gilt sell-off this month, was flat at $1.235.\n\nIn a sign of the strain on public finances from higher inflation, interest costs were £8.3bn in December, £3.8bn higher than a year earlier and the third-highest December figure since monthly records began. A £1.7bn payment for the repurchase of military dwellings added to December’s borrowing.\n\nTax receipts in the month rose £4bn from December 2023 to £65.5bn. Public sector debt, or borrowing accumulated over time, was 97.2 per cent of GDP, remaining at levels last seen in the early 1960s.\n\nElliott Jordan-Doak, economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “We expect the government to outline spending reductions — backloaded towards the end of the forecast year — at the next fiscal event in March. Further tax increases at the next Budget in October is also a good bet.”\n\nWith additional reporting by Ian Smith and Lucy Fisher in London",

    "body": "Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster’s property company, has sold a £306mn stake in its historic Mayfair estate in London to the Norwegian oil fund as the landlord looks to reinvest into development and lending.\n\nThe $1.7tn Norwegian sovereign wealth fund will take a 25 per cent stake in a new joint venture worth about £1.2bn, adding to its large bets on the fortunes of London’s West End.\n\nGrosvenor will maintain control and continue to manage the portfolio of 175 buildings around Mount Street and Grosvenor Street, including The Connaught hotel.\n\nThe deal is the largest sale to outside investors from the Mayfair estate, which was developed under the stewardship of the Grosvenor family beginning in the 1720s.\n\n“It is incredibly significant for us,” said James Raynor, chief executive of Grosvenor’s UK property division. “We thought long and hard about this. The ongoing management and control was crucial.”\n\nIt also marks the first big new investment by the Norwegian oil fund in London since 2018. The fund already owns a stake in Regent Street alongside the Crown Estate, and last year boosted its ownership share of the Pollen Estate, located near Savile Row, where it first invested in 2014.\n\nThe fund last year also took full ownership of the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield, paying £360mn for British Land’s 50 per cent stake, and is a major investor in listed London landlords such as Great Portland Estates.\n\n“We have confidence in the long-term value creation inherent in the West End,” said Jayesh Patel, head of the fund’s UK real estate.\n\nThe £1.2bn joint venture is only one part of Grosvenor’s £4.8bn UK property portfolio, the bulk of which consists of its large holdings in the Mayfair and Belgravia neighbourhoods. Grosvenor will keep the freehold ownership of the buildings, while the joint venture holds a long lease.\n\nAlthough prestigious and highly valued, the core portfolio yields a lower return than riskier ventures. Grosvenor, which also has a large agricultural business and overseas investments, said it would invest some of the proceeds into its expanding UK residential development lending business, which finances residential projects across the country.\n\n“It provides a different kind of return for us. It is much higher yielding than the estate. That is a good balance for us,” said Raynor.\n\nHe said Grosvenor made a strategic decision to bring in a partner to help “release some capital”, which was more attractive than other options such as borrowing. “We’re a very long-term business. We’re constantly thinking in generations. So our approach to debt is very conservative,” added Raynor.\n\nGrosvenor selected the joint venture portfolio to represent a mix of uses, with about 45 per cent office space, 30 per cent retail and 10 per cent residential.\n\nMount Street is known for its luxury shops and some of Mayfair’s best-known restaurants, such as Scott’s, while Grosvenor Street has more office buildings.\n\nThe company will also use the money to help fund its £1.3bn 10-year development pipeline, which includes an overhaul of Grosvenor Square and a £500mn redevelopment centred around South Molton Street, near Bond Street station. Grosvenor has partnered with Mitsui Fudosan on the South Molton scheme.",

    "body": "It’s the bane of being a consultancy: you conduct right-minded research and then fail to put it into practice. Big Four firms PwC, author of Women in Work, and EY, behind European Financial Services Boardroom Monitor, are on track to flunk their own targets for women partners in the UK.\n\nLuckily, there’s a PowerPoint presentation to address this shortcoming. First up: it’s not just them and it’s not just women. Companies across the globe are rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion goals, bowing to a new legal backdrop and zeitgeist. In the US these include retailer Walmart, burger joint McDonald’s, social media giant Meta and PwC.\n\nAs for women, fewer were granted new S&P 500 board positions last year: 42 per cent versus 46 per cent the previous year, according to executive search firm Spencer Stuart. None self-identified as non-binary.\n\nSlide two: read the small print. This trend was reversed in the UK. In the top 150 boardrooms, 43 per cent of directors are women, up from the year-ago 40 per cent. Drill down to executive level, though, and the proportion shrinks to less than half that.\n\nSlide three repurposes the same one used in presentations on renewables, AI and pretty much everything else: these things take time. When Norway launched its quota, the same group of qualified women — the so-called golden skirts — presided over multiple portfolios of non-exec directorships.\n\nBuilding a pipeline of talent takes time and many women are felled at the first hurdle. Despite making up nearly half of the US workforce, female participation falls to 39 per cent at managerial level. For directors it’s 37 per cent, and just 29 per cent in the C-suite, finds McKinsey.\n\nAbsent in the consultant’s PowerPoint, though, is more meaningful data. Splitting workers by parallel caregiving roles, rather than anatomically, is more logical — not least in professional services, where taking a couple of years out to start a family can knock you back several more rungs on the partnership ladder.\n\nPew Research took a stab at this using 2022 data. In typical small-children-at-home years, aged 35-44, 94 per cent of fathers were active workers versus 75 per cent for mothers. That gap shrinks to a third the size when considering child-free respondents — implying concomitant salary and promotion gaps. Some research goes further, suggesting younger women — potential mothers — suffer the “maybe baby” career handicap regardless of whether or not said baby materialises.\n\nThat leaves two takeaways for the Big Four: get women partner goals back on track, and task the interns with harvesting more useful data sets.\n\nlouise.lucas@ft.com",

    "blurb": "Once the stuff of crime thrillers and haunts of secret agents, these storied homes tucked down cobblestone streets continue to have an idiosyncratic allure",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Beginning life in the shadow of London’s grandest houses, mews properties are a peculiarly British phenomenon. Tucked away, these cobbled streets of low-slung terraces continue to offer up surprises.\n\nAs stabling for the upper classes, the modest buildings were designed for discreet access. In time, they became the haunts of the nefarious rather than the equestrian — and gained a whiff of notoriety that they haven’t completely shaken.\n\nFictional depictions of mews trade heavily on their air of secrecy. They are particularly associated with crime thrillers, from the foggy pursuits of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson across the cobbles of Marylebone to Agatha Christie’s 1937 story “Murder in the Mews”.\n\nWith Wimpole Mews making headlines for its role in the Profumo affair in the 1960s, mews became associated with secret agents. In the same decade, Mayfair’s Upper Berkeley Mews (a fictional conflation of two real addresses) was a natural fit for the debonair vigilante character of Simon Templar of the TV series The Saint, who lived in an “ingeniously comfortable fortress” of converted garages. Fifty years later mews’ association with well-heeled mavericks continued with Colin Firth’s character in Kingsman: The Secret Service.\n\nPerhaps it’s this slightly glamorous sense of infamy that has long attracted musicians and actors, from Madonna to Michael Caine. “They’ve always attracted the creative and the unconventional,” says Edward Thomson of estate agent Strutt & Parker. “It’s hard to believe how private and peaceful a mews can be, amid the hustle and bustle of London.”\n\nFor Istanbul-born Damla Tuncel and her husband Alexander, a New Yorker, this sense of tranquillity was a key factor in their decision to buy a mews house. The couple spent two years looking for the perfect one, which they found in South Kensington’s Princes Gate Mews last summer.\n\n“We wanted something [that felt] more like a house than our Earl’s Court flat,” says Damla, a portfolio manager at Wellington Management. “At the viewing, residents were watering each other’s flower pots, children playing on the cobbled street; we glimpsed a camaraderie that we’d never had in London.” The sociability of such narrow streets, often cul-de-sacs, is a major attraction for some buyers, concurs Peggy Lurot, of specialist mews estate agents Lurot Brand.\n\nAlthough they tend to lack private gardens, many mews buildings have verdant pockets outside their front door, adding to their cottage-like ambience. This, along with their sociability, means mews command a premium, says Lurot. Over the past decade, mews have retained more of their value than other types of property in prime central London — all of which have fallen, according to Savills Research.\n\nThe average selling price of a mews property in prime London in the fourth quarter of 2024 was £2.89mn, according to Savills — when priced per square foot, that’s £1,570; lower than houses (£1,830) and flats (£1,760). Maida Vale and neighbouring W2 (including Paddington and Bayswater) are good places to find homes in a lower price bracket: £1mn-£1.5mn, according to Lurot Brand.\n\nElegant arches bookend many mews streets, heightening the sense of entry into an exclusive domain. The best-preserved mews are protected by Conservation Area status, and some are listed. Martyn John Brown, a chartered surveyor who runs the Everchanging Mews website, picks out South Kensington’s Kynance Mews — often pictured with its Virginia creeper-clad arch and tumbling wisteria — and Holland Park Mews as being two of the best examples.\n\nThe relative functionality of mews makes them attractive to wealthy downsizers. Caroline, who preferred not to disclose her full name, and her husband recently bought a three-bedroom mews property in South Kensington, for this reason: “After our three children moved out of our town house in Westminster, we wanted lower maintenance and fewer stairs. We spend a lot of time abroad and having a garage spares us resident parking issues.”\n\nPreviously burnt by quadrupling service charges on a flat, the couple also liked the property’s freehold status — a common sentiment, says Thomson, who cites increasing annual charges and a wariness around leasehold ownership as reasons why buyers like mews.\n\nTheir original garaging function also remains a strong draw, as Caroline suggests. Perhaps that’s why they’ve been home to many auto-obsessives, such as Formula One drivers James Hunt and Stirling Moss. A home for his beloved car drew Tony and his wife Soo Ying to purchase a property with an integral garage in Pindock Mews in Maida Vale — a street once the home to the Sex Pistols’ Sid Vicious.\n\nA corner mews, it has been remodelled completely into a 2,500 sq ft two-bedroom house on three floors, with a floating glass staircase to help light filter through. “We knocked down walls to turn lots of small rooms into larger, more practical spaces,” says Tony, who works in shipping and preferred not to disclose his full name. “Not having a garden is a compromise, but it suited us.” The property is for sale at £3.5mn through Arlington Residential.\n\nDespite its modest front door, the house, like many other mews, is deceptively large. Because planning rules typically require that the front facade with the carriage or garage door must usually stay as is, there’s often little hint of the radical interpretation within.\n\nBuilt with typically 7ft ceiling heights and no windows at the rear, many unmodified mews have a somewhat dingy feel, although the ground floor was built at around 10ft to accommodate horses. Changing ceiling heights and moving walls are typical renovations, according to Andy Willis of RBD Architecture & Interiors. Roof or mansard extensions — sometimes with the addition of a roof terrace — are also popular, but can cause issues with the property behind.\n\n“I love mews properties as they are super tricky — you need to puzzle hard for clever solutions to get the light in from the front or above,” Willis says. To maximise light he employs glass floor panels for landings, as well as back-lit coffered ceilings to give the illusion of natural light. Layered lighting and very tall doors give a greater feeling of space.\n\nIn the past, basement extensions were a popular way to add another floor (or two) but are now limited to a single storey, if permitted at all. And while there was once a vogue for combining adjoining mews houses to create a single larger dwelling — such as the four-storey, seven-bedroom Reeves Mews in Mayfair, which, at £22.5mn, set the record for the most expensive mews house ever sold in 2015 — such amalgamations are now generally rejected by planning, says Willis.\n\nOutside London, it’s possible to live in a mews for a lower price point. “They offer an accessible way for buyers to own a house, rather than a flat, in some excellent central locations,” says Ben Ginn of Savills Edinburgh, where prices start around £400,000.  “so generally sell quickly.”\n\nWhen the mews strikes, you could say.\n\nThis article has been amended since original publication\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow @ft_houseandhome on Instagram",

    "blurb": "Corporate leaders must embrace risk more for the long-term good of their companies",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Government officials are often a target for business leaders who complain that the right incentives don’t exist to enable their companies to grow. But the corporate world’s top brass might also want to look closer to home when figuring out how to tackle stasis.\n\nThe confidence to make bold decisions even during tough times is critical to corporate growth. But taking risks in the face of uncertainty has been harder in recent years as executives struggle with seemingly never-ending upheaval, ranging from geopolitical tensions and workforce pressures to technological disruption.\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, chief executives in general have become less charismatic, less strategic and more focused on execution, according to a working paper for the US National Bureau of Economic Research. Apart from the tech universe, we seem to be in the era of the cost-cutters, not the innovators.\n\n“In times of crisis and epidemics, wildfires and global warming, and particularly since Covid, we can see that the population as a whole is moving towards a more risk-averse disposition,” says Geoff Trickey, a chartered psychologist who specialises in how risk instincts influence business decisions.\n\nGrowth is difficult to achieve, particularly over the long term. Only one in 10 S&P 500 companies in 2022 had reported growth above GDP for more than 30 years, according to research from McKinsey. Companies such as Airbnb, Microsoft and Burger King rose to prominence or reinvented themselves during periods of economic turbulence. But how many companies are unwittingly ushering in their Kodak or Blockbuster moment?\n\nWhile recent earnings have been strong in the US, a more recent survey of 500 CEOs and other senior leaders by McKinsey pointed to a current gap between their growth ambitions and their ability to hit these targets. Only 29 per cent of respondents said they focused more than a third of their time on long-term initiatives. Importantly, just 30 per cent said they funnelled more resources into new businesses and other growth drivers at times of volatility. And just 8 per cent were confident in their organisation’s recruitment pipeline.\n\nIn the UK, things seem particularly glum. A third of UK chief executives surveyed by PwC don’t even believe their own business will be economically viable in a decade’s time, let alone have confidence in their prospects for growth.\n\nBusiness leaders have every right to blame the domestic backdrop for some of their failure to grow — from erratic politics to barriers to hiring and investment. High interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty and regulatory concerns have also led to a deal drought in the past few years.\n\nWhile many now believe answers to a paucity of growth lie in the full embrace of artificial intelligence, that won’t resolve the mindset problem. Without confidence, leaders are less likely to make acquisitions, invest in new markets, embrace transformation, manage disruption or steer organisations towards growth.\n\nWith CEO tenure falling, there is a further impetus to focus on the shorter term over committing to investments for the future. It’s why so many leaders underinvest in research and development and fail to cultivate a culture that rewards creativity. Corporate failures in recent years have also been so painful, both financially and reputationally, that compliance, legal and public relations teams are far more influential than before.\n\nThis is where the board of directors should play a critical role in being effective long-term stewards for an organisation — helping to recognise and overcome barriers such as a poorly developed talent pipeline. Yet many are afraid of scrutiny themselves — from their peers, shareholders and the press — often leading them to hire their own legal counsel, separate from company executives. “Everyone is so worried about getting anything slightly wrong,” says one investigations lawyer in the UK.\n\nOf course, pursuing a narrow version of growth at the expense of employees or wider society is also flawed. But there is merit in pushing for a type of expansion that mobilises an organisation, brings staff together behind a common purpose and elevates ambitions. This in turn can generate greater shareholder value, help companies hire star talent, innovate and create jobs. Business leaders pointing fingers at government inertia should take care not to fall into the same traps themselves.\n\nanjli.raval@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this column:A military mnemonic / From Professor Chris Rowley, Kellogg College, University of Oxford and Bayes Business School, University of London, UK",

    "blurb": "Advisers call for rethink of how Treasury imposes planned extension of IHT to retirement funds ",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Pension advisers and wealth management chiefs have urged the Treasury to rethink plans for how to apply inheritance tax to pension funds, warning that current proposals could lead to severe delays and increased costs for the bereaved, even in cases where no inheritance tax is due.\n\nIn her Budget last autumn, chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that pension funds would become part of inherited estates by April 2027, a move set to upset tax planning by wealthy people but raise £1.5bn a year for the Treasury by 2030.\n\nThe government estimates its proposals will bring about 1.5 per cent more estates within the scope of death duties in 2027-28, on top of the 4 per cent that already exceed the £325,000 nil-rate band, which can rise to £500,000 where a property is passed on.\n\nBut concerns have been raised by tax and pension professionals about potential harmful effects in consultations on the technical details of the government proposals that close on Wednesday.\n\nThe Society Of Pension Professionals, a trade association, warned that the government’s plans “impose unrealistic and impractical timescales” while applying interest charges or penalties on pension scheme administrators for delays “over which they have little or no control”.\n\nThe chief executives of some of the UK’s largest wealth managers, including Interactive Investor, Quilter and AJ Bell, have also written to the chancellor over the “flawed and potentially damaging” proposals, calling on the government to “work with the pensions industry to agree a simpler method of achieving the policy aim”.\n\nThe letter, seen by the Financial Times, said: “The complexity of the proposed approach, namely bringing all pensions into estates for IHT, will lead to substantial delays paying money to beneficiaries on death and cause distress for bereaved families.”\n\nUnder the proposals, personal representatives of inherited pension funds would be responsible for identifying the funds and calculating how much, if any, IHT is owed, taking into account other assets in the estate. The pension scheme administrator would then be responsible for paying the inheritance tax before releasing the funds.\n\nExperts say this could cause delays in payouts, including to those not liable for the tax. Under current rules, inherited pensions can be paid more quickly to beneficiaries and used to pay for probate costs, funeral charges and other urgent bills.\n\n“The (new) process is complicated and it will punish lower earners,” said Anna Rogers, senior partner at Arc Pensions Law. “Wealthy people don’t need the money quickly . . . it seems the harm will be disproportionately to those who aren’t wealthy and those who die young.”\n\nLawyers are also concerned that the six-month window between death and the deadline for payment of inheritance tax does not leave enough time for pension funds to be identified and the tax to be calculated, leaving individuals vulnerable to late payment charges.\n\n“Pension scheme rules allow two years to pay death benefits . . . there may be a need to sell assets to pay the tax, but there might be cases of people not being able to pay, for example, if a property needs to be sold,” said Jeremy Harris, a partner at Fieldfisher.\n\nThe SPP has urged the government to either leave the calculation and payment of IHT to the pension’s personal representative and HM Revenue & Customs — or for the benefit to be taxed in full at 40 per cent and paid promptly by the scheme administrator in the minority of cases where a pension is subject to IHT.\n\nSteve Hitchiner, of the SPP, said issues relating to the reporting and payment of inheritance tax on pensions were “vitally important” and the current proposals “will result in numerous problems and challenges which could be largely avoided”.\n\nSome death-in-service benefits, designed to provide financial security for someone’s dependants if they die unexpectedly young, could also face a large inheritance tax bill, in cases where they are set up as part of the registered pension scheme.\n\n“It’s got the potential to be quite a mess . . . at some point there will be a backlash,” Harris said.\n\nKate Smith, head of public affairs at Aegon, added that there is a lack of clarity over what is in scope and that “nobody thinks [the proposals] will work”.\n\nThe Treasury said: “We continue to incentivise pensions savings for their intended purpose of funding retirement instead of them being openly used as a vehicle to transfer wealth.”",

    "blurb": "Public accounts committee accuses tax authority of pushing taxpayers too quickly towards digital services",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK tax authority “sought to degrade” its telephone helplines and “was willing to let them fail” in its push to drive taxpayers towards online services, an influential group of cross-party MPs has concluded.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs had been “too quick to restrict access to its telephone services before ensuring replacement digital services are fully in place”, the House of Commons public accounts committee said on Wednesday.\n\n“All of [HMRC’s] customers have a legal obligation to pay their taxes so it has a responsibility to engage with them,” said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the public accounts committee. “If I were a teacher marking HMRC’s homework, I’d give it a ‘could do better’ or a ‘needs improvement’.”\n\nThe tax authority began its move to using digital services in 2010 with the goal of providing online support to customers, freeing up phone lines for vulnerable individuals and those with complex needs.\n\nBut demand for its helplines has remained high. A report released last May by the National Audit Office spending watchdog found that taxpayers jointly spent the equivalent of nearly 800 years on hold to HMRC in 2022-23 — more than double the number in 2019-20.\n\nSir Jim Harra, HMRC chief executive, said the committee’s claims were “completely baseless”. The tax authority had cut call wait times to around 11 minutes compared with around 28 minutes in April 2024.\n\nHe added: “We will always be there to answer the phone for those who need extra help. At the same time, more than 80 per cent of customers are satisfied with our digital services.”\n\nThe MPs said in their report that HMRC should “reinstate a call waiting time target as a key performance measure” and “ensure it gives customers accurate estimates of call waiting times in real time”.\n\nThe report urged the tax authority to scrap its policy of cutting off phone calls when a customer has been on hold for 70 minutes. In 2023-24, HMRC terminated more than 43,000 calls in this manner, up sixfold from the previous year, according to the NAO.\n\nIn March 2024, HMRC halted plans to dramatically cut back its helplines with just two days’ notice after a backlash from professional bodies.\n\nThe MPs also called on HMRC to take further action to reduce the money owed to the agency. The tax authority’s debt balance ballooned to £43.9bn in March 2023, up from about £15bn in the five years preceding the pandemic.\n\nThe government announced £303mn in additional funding in 2023-24 to help HMRC manage tax debts, but the balance had fallen by just 2 per cent — or £900mn — by March 2024.",

    "blurb": "Spending watchdog says maintenance backlog totals £49bn, dominated by schools, NHS and MoD properties",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK government buildings have been “left to crumble” causing disruption to public services, the National Audit Office warned on Wednesday.\n\nPoor building conditions and a maintenance backlog of at least £49bn across government departments has disrupted services, hit government productivity and put safety at risk, according to a report by the spending watchdog.\n\n“I am concerned that for too long schools, hospitals and prisons have been left to crumble. This is putting the safety of those who work in and use these public services at risk,” said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the public accounts committee.\n\nRecent incidents caused by poor building conditions have included a partial roof collapse at Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport in March 2024, forcing patients to be evacuated and procedures to be cancelled, and the failure of a fire alarm system at Birmingham’s Victoria Law Courts, leading to a loss of 4,176 courtroom days between May 2022 and January 2024.\n\nThe NAO’s report said the Ministry of Defence, the NHS and schools represented 88 per cent of the total £49bn maintenance backlog — schools and the NHS have backlogs of £13.8bn each while the MoD’s properties have a backlog of £15.3bn. The remainder includes courts and prisons.\n\nThe maintenance backlog has increased steadily in recent years, with the Office of Government Property (OGP) estimating it has risen from £14.8bn in January 2019.\n\nThe NAO cited “historic under-investment” by governments, cost increases and loss of income during the pandemic as reasons for the recent growth in the backlog.\n\nHowever, data from individual organisations suggests maintenance backlogs have been rising for at least a decade — between 2014-15 and 2023-24, NHS England’s backlog had an average increase of 11 per cent every year.\n\nThe OGP believes the actual cost of fixing government buildings could be “substantially higher” than the NAO’s £49bn estimate due to incomplete data on building maintenance.\n\nSome departments were found to have last surveyed the conditions of their properties more than five years ago. Other departments were found to be surveying property conditions regularly but not routinely publishing the data, preventing the OGP from forming a complete view.\n\nOrganisations also include differing costs in backlog calculations, preventing comparisons across departments.\n\nThe inconsistency of the data affects the government’s ability to be strategic when prioritising funding, the NAO found, as departments with poor data are less able to build strong cases to present to the Treasury.\n\nGareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: “Government needs better data on the condition of its operational assets and should use it to plan efficient maintenance programmes to deliver better services and value for money.”\n\nThe OGP said: “We are taking immediate action to remedy the state of disrepair found across the public estate, which is the result of long-term under-investment in maintenance and upkeep.“As part of this, we are already investing billions of pounds to deliver critical repairs and rebuild our public services, to tackle maintenance backlogs and improve our hospitals, schools and prisons.”",

    "body": "Ministers have forced out the chair of the UK Competition and Markets Authority, as the government seeks to dial back regulation as part of Labour’s growth agenda.\n\nThe government confirmed the departure of Marcus Bokkerink as chair of the CMA on Tuesday evening, after the Financial Times reported that business secretary Jonathan Reynolds had intervened at the agency.\n\nThe Department for Business and Trade made clear to Bokkerink on Monday that it felt the regulator was not sufficiently focused on growth, according to one government figure.\n\nBokkerink, a former managing director at Boston Consulting Group, was appointed in 2022. CMA chairs can serve up to a five-year term.\n\nThe government has appointed Doug Gurr as new interim chair of the CMA.\n\nGurr ran Amazon’s UK business during the company’s tussle with the CMA over its minority investment in Deliveroo, which the regulator ultimately approved in 2020. He is currently director of the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nReynolds said in a statement that the government had a “plan for change” that would boost growth for businesses and communities across the UK.\n\n“We want to see regulators including the CMA supercharging the economy with pro-business decisions that will drive prosperity and growth, putting more money in people’s pockets,” he added.\n\nBokkerink defended his record as CMA chair in a statement, saying that he had helped refocus the agency to ensure it delivered on empowering “consumers and effective competition — instead of being held back by a few powerful incumbents setting the rules for everyone else”.\n\nHe added that the CMA’s approach, set out in its annual plan last week, “will no doubt change. I wish Doug and the government best of luck in finding a different path that works more effectively.”\n\nThe CMA has been the focus of complaints to ministers from business leaders, frustrated by what they see as an excessively interventionist approach to deals.\n\n“We know that [the CMA’s] performance has not been good enough,” said one government figure. “There is a lot of frustration about this across the board from business. We are hearing unhappiness from everyone.”\n\nCompanies and their advisers will be closely watching to see how the appointment of Gurr may have an impact on CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell’s approach.\n\nCardell has been at pains in recent months to emphasise that the authority is engaging more with companies and will be “participative” in its application of new powers in digital markets, which came into effect this month.\n\nThe CMA came under intense criticism from Microsoft in 2023 for its handling of the technology giant’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The agency ultimately approved the deal between the two US-based businesses — after having initially sought to block it.\n\nTom Smith, partner at law firm Geradin Partners and former CMA legal director, said Bokkerink’s replacement “came as a surprise” to competition lawyers.\n\n“Government seems to be sending a strong signal, especially about merger control,” he added. “It is tempting to say that now would be a good time to file a merger at the CMA.”\n\nIn October last year, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also took aim at the CMA in a speech to business leaders, telling them he would “make sure that every regulator in this country, especially our economic and competition regulators, takes growth as seriously as this room does”.\n\nEleven of the 33-member CMA merger panel, an independent group of experts that decides whether any deal that might threaten competition can proceed, are due to step down later this year. The business department is in charge of appointing their replacements.\n\nOne government figure said it was reasonable to assume that more of those incoming panel members would have a business background.\n\n​Letter in response to this article:\n\nCompetition is for consumers, not well-connected businesses / Professor John Thanassoulis, Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK; Independent Panel Member, UK Competition and Markets Authority",

    "blurb": "Raising both UK payroll costs and worker protections is a deterrent to hiring",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Britain’s Labour government was always going to struggle to balance its pledge to “make work pay” by improving workers’ rights with its overriding priority of boosting growth. Its October Budget, which heaped tax rises on to business, has made the clash even more acute. As the Financial Times has reported, the government is now seeking compromises on parts of its landmark employment rights bill. Yet what it has offered so far is fiddling around the edges. If Labour is to foster the economic dynamism the UK needs, it must go much further in adjusting the legislation to meet business concerns.\n\nThe bill gives workers protection against unfair dismissal from day one, with a probation period, and stronger rights on flexible working. It includes a clampdown on “exploitative” use of zero-hours contracts, and on fire and rehire tactics. The government’s own analysis estimates it will cost business £5bn a year to implement the package.\n\nWhat has riled companies, however, is how Labour has combined these changes with Budget increases in payroll taxes — both raising the rate and slashing the threshold at which they kick in — and a big rise in the national minimum wage. This triple whammy will sharply lift the costs, in particular, of low-wage and entry-level jobs, creating a disincentive to hire and expand. Figures on Tuesday showed employers have cut staff numbers since the Budget.\n\nNudging companies to invest more in technology, as many now say they will, and rely less on low-wage workers is in theory no bad thing given the UK’s poor labour productivity. But the freed-up workers need to be recycled into new and productive jobs. If soaring costs are deterring businesses across the economy from hiring, that works against the government’s priority of creating both more, and more secure, employment.\n\nSince Labour is unlikely to revisit its flagship Budget measures — the bigger worry for business — it will need to be doubly careful about how it rolls out new employment rights. That does not mean the reforms should be abandoned. Action is badly needed to curb abuses, reduce precarity and help people caring for family to work. But the government should adjust how it plans to implement the measures — or, if necessary, amend the legislation — to avoid penalising business.\n\nOn zero-hours contracts, the government should look again at how it can include agency workers in the new right to a guaranteed-hours contract, while still allowing employers enough flexibility. And it should ensure that the reference period over which workers’ regular hours are calculated takes account of seasonal fluctuations, to ensure it does not hamper, say, retailers staffing up temporarily in the holiday season.\n\nLabour has already compromised on its original aim of granting protection for employees against unfair dismissal on day one — down from two years at present — by allowing a nine-month probation period with a “lighter-touch” dismissals process. But small businesses warn even this is an insufficient safeguard against vexatious claims that can be cripplingly expensive to defend. Better to set the unfair dismissals threshold at, say, six months, more in line with some European counterparts.\n\nMaking it harder for businesses to fire workers then rehire them on worse terms is justified. The proposals, though, are too tightly drawn, requiring companies to be almost insolvent before they can change contracts. The government should look again, too, at rule changes that could potentially hand too much power to trade unions in the workplace.\n\nBeing seen to dilute its rights package will irk Labour’s left wing and its union allies. But since its longer-term political prospects hinge on jump-starting growth, a bigger priority must be to start rebuilding the country’s distinctly battered business confidence.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nThe employment rights bill is good for businesses / From Paul Nowak, General Secretary, Trades Union Congress, London WC1, UK",

    "blurb": "New app will also include documents showing criminal record checks and proof of eligibility for state benefits",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK has launched a new digital wallet that will allow people to hold driving licences and veteran ID cards on their smartphones, as part of Sir Keir Starmer’s drive to modernise the British state and drive growth.\n\nTechnology secretary Peter Kyle said on Tuesday that by 2027 the government’s new digital wallet would include documents showing criminal record checks and proof of eligibility for state benefits, and possibly even digital versions of passports.\n\n“We are going to transform the relationship between citizen and state because it is absolutely vital that we do so,” tech secretary Peter Kyle said, echoing terminology used by former tech secretary Matt Hancock in 2018.\n\nThe government is planning to launch a new app in the summer that will contain the digital wallet and other personal information about individual interactions with state departments, including payment details. The app will make use of facial recognition technology to verify users.\n\nThe move is part of a wider push by Starmer’s Labour administration to use technology to transform government operations, improve lacklustre productivity across Whitehall and drive economic growth.\n\nKyle said there was no plan to make any form of digital identification or paperwork mandatory, suggesting the move was not a stepping stone to compulsory digital ID cards, previously proposed by Tony Blair’s New Labour government.\n\n“There is no plan to make it compulsory but you can see that I’m striving to make it desirable,” Kyle said. “Tech that’s being developed in the private sector doesn’t rely on compulsion to drive customers to them — they have to be as magnetic as they possibly can.”\n\nHe added that there were no current plans to use the wallet to store data on immigration status, adding that “nothing is off the table”.\n\nKyle also announced the forthcoming launch of a series of AI tools — nicknamed “Humphrey” — that he claimed would help civil servants improve decision making and reduce consultancy spending.\n\nOne of the tools, called “Consult”, would analyse responses to government consultations, while another, called “Lex”, is intended to help officials sort through legal texts.\n\nJoe Hill, a former Treasury civil servant and now policy director at the Reform think-tank, said the announcements were a “welcome step” but “will not deliver a truly digital state alone”.\n\nHe said the government would need to take risks by making “serious investments” and by “accepting that some of those investments won’t work”.\n\n“False economies have plagued digital transformation by successive governments,” he said. “The real test of this government’s commitment to modernisation will be the upcoming Spending Review.”",

    "blurb": "Labour advised there are no legal grounds for reimposing restrictions on consultant that followed South African ‘misconduct’",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The Labour government has tried and failed to reimpose a ban on consultancy firm Bain & Co working for the British state despite ministers’ concerns about its past “misconduct” in a major corruption scandal in South Africa.\n\nPat McFadden, Cabinet Office secretary, said he had requested legal options to bring back the ban on the company, only to be told that there were “no legal routes to do so” without any new information about the relevant case.\n\nBain, a Boston-based global management consultant, was given a three-year ban from tendering for British government contracts in August 2022, when Boris Johnson was prime minister.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, Cabinet Office secretary at the time, justified the intervention on the basis that “Bain & Co is guilty of grave professional misconduct which renders its integrity questionable”.\n\nAn inquiry by Raymond Zondo, then South African deputy chief justice, into the country’s biggest post-apartheid corruption scandal found that Bain helped to undermine the country’s revenue service through advisory work that helped allies of former president Jacob Zuma.\n\nBut only six months into the UK ban the Cabinet Office reversed its decision, saying the ban would be lifted for Bain albeit not for its South African arm.\n\nLord Peter Hain, former UK cabinet minister and anti-apartheid campaigner, who grew up in South Africa, wrote to McFadden before Christmas urging the minister to impose a fresh ban on contracts for Bain & Co.\n\nThe Labour peer pointed out that the South African government has suspended Bain from working for it for a decade until 2032. He criticised Bain for refusing to accept the verdicts of two judicial commissions in their entirety.\n\n“Surely Bain should not be permitted to operate public contracts in the UK, at least until it has repaid all the fees earned from the South African state during the Zuma-Gupta [business family] years, made full disclosure . . . and the Zondo-recommended legal action against the company should be completed,” Hain stated.\n\nIn his reply to Hain, McFadden said he shared the concerns about suppliers to the British government needing to operate to high standards. “The Zondo commission referred to Bain’s role in Sars [South African Revenue Service] as unlawful and concluded they had engaged in collusion and state capture,” he said.\n\nBut the minister said he had requested legal advice on options to extend the ban, only to be told that there were “no legal routes” to do so. “This advice was tested with expert counsel who confirmed that no legal route existed for extension of the ban and therefore the government is unable to do so.”\n\nMcFadden said he could not take a further decision unless material new information came to light that had not been considered by the previous administration.\n\nThe Cabinet Office minister said that under the Procurement Act 2023 there would be new powers from February this year to take stronger and broader action against suppliers involved in misconduct. “I am actively exploring options for enhancing these powers and further measures to enable the government to take even stronger (action) against suppliers, like Bain, who have committed misconduct.”\n\nBain & Co said in a statement that it had taken significant measures to strengthen its governance for public sector contracts since its work with Sars from 2015 to 2017.\n\n“While there were no findings from two official commissions of inquiry of any illegal actions by Bain, we accepted responsibility for the events at that time and repaid all fees, with interest, to Sars,” it said.\n\nHain said he was “frustrated” but understood the reasons for McFadden’s conclusions. “Bain should take no comfort. Their reputation remains toxic.”\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Whilst decisions on the exclusion of Bain from bidding for UK government contracts were made by the previous government, the government will take strong action against any future supplier misconduct wherever it is found, and will provide a further update in due course.”",

    "blurb": "Research highlights rise of China as key rival to US in spending on innovation, including AI",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The number of British companies listed among the global top 2,000 spenders on research and development almost halved in the 10 years to 2023, pointing to the challenges for the UK to “win the global race” on artificial intelligence.\n\nSixty-three UK companies were among the top 2,000 spenders on R&D globally in 2023, down from 70 in 2022 and 118 in 2013, according to data from the EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard.\n\nBy comparison, the US had 681 companies, up from 668 a decade ago, and China registered 524, up from just 119 in 2013.\n\nBritain’s share of global spending on R&D has declined steadily over the past decade, in line with a broader downward trend among most advanced economies excluding the US. The trend reflects China becoming a key rival to the US in R&D spending and innovations, including AI.\n\nThe figures relate to the level of R&D funded by companies, not all of which is carried out in the country in which the company is registered.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer last week pledged to “move fast and take action to win the global race” on AI, which is at the forefront of innovation and has enjoyed a surge in investment around the world in recent years.\n\nHe described the fast-evolving technology as a “chance to turbocharge growth” — a core mission of his administration.\n\nBut Carlos López-Gómez, head of policy links at IfM Engage, a consultancy at the University of Cambridge, said the US and China were “way ahead of the UK” on AI and “we should worry about the fall in the number of UK companies among the top global R&D spenders”.\n\n“We should also worry that despite the UK being a global leader in academic scientific research, the private sector is not as R&D-intensive,” he added.\n\nSeparate figures tracked by the OECD show that the cumulative amount of venture capital invested in AI start-ups between 2012 and 2023 totalled $427bn in the US and $232bn in China, but only $29.8bn in the UK.\n\nOverall UK business investment, which is considered a key factor for innovation and productivity growth and of which R&D is a part, rose in the first three quarters of 2024, according to official figures.\n\nBut Britain has underperformed the US over the past decade following weak business investment growth since the Brexit referendum. The US lead in tech has been identified as a key factor in its faster productivity growth over Britain and the EU in the past 20 years.\n\nThe UK had only two companies, pharmaceutical groups AstraZeneca and GSK, in the top 100 R&D spenders in 2023, the latest year for which the EU scoreboard figures, published at the end of last month, are available.\n\nWith investment from 275 companies, software and computing services received the most financial backing of any sector among the top 2,000 R&D spenders in 2023. Of the 275 companies, 158 were from the US, 59 were Chinese and seven were from the UK.\n\nLópez-Gómez said that while Britain ranked well in academic research output and top-performing universities, its scientific knowledge was “not translating into economic value”.\n\nThe country was at “risk of becoming the lab of the world, having all these new technologies” that would be scaled up in order to deliver high-paid jobs overseas, he added, as he called on ministers to “think not only on technology development but also adoption in a way that relates to business objectives”.\n\nNonetheless, experts have welcomed Starmer’s AI measures, which include increasing public compute capacity by twentyfold and creating a National Data Library.\n\nUmang Paw, chief technology officer at advisory firm PwC UK, said the policies marked a “welcome step forward as the UK looks to grasp the huge opportunities that AI can provide to the country’s economy and public services”.\n\nPaul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said AI would “encourage investment and lead to much faster productivity growth” irrespective of where innovation occurred.\n\nThe UK’s strength in services meant it “was better placed to enjoy a bigger boost than most other major economies,” he said, adding that success would rest in part on the government “setting the right conditions and not regulating it [AI] too heavily”.\n\nThe government said it was “determined to unleash UK R&D as a driving force in our mission to grow the economy” and that Britain continued “to attract high levels of international investment”.",

    "blurb": "PM vows to introduce tougher laws if necessary after Southport killer pleaded guilty ",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer has warned the UK faces a terror threat from “loners, misfits [and] young men in their bedrooms”, as he vowed to change the law if needed to prevent a repeat of the Southport killings.\n\nThe threat from political groups such as al-Qaeda now sits “alongside” the risk from individuals “accessing all manner of material online” who were “fixated on extreme violence” and became “desperate for notoriety”, the prime minister said on Tuesday.\n\nHe promised that last summer’s attack — when 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana murdered three young girls at a dance class — would mark a “line in the sand” for Britain.\n\n“If the law needs to change to recognise this new and dangerous threat, we will change it, and quickly,” promised Starmer.\n\nRudakubana on Monday pleaded guilty to murder.\n\nIn July last year, he killed Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Da Silva Aguiar, nine, in what prosecutors called a “meticulously planned rampage”.\n\nLast year, MI5 head Sir Ken McCallum warned that one in eight terrorists being investigated in the UK were minors who were often recruited online. The domestic intelligence agency had seen a three-fold increase in investigations into under-18s in three years, he said in October.\n\nStarmer was speaking on Tuesday as it became apparent that Rudakubana was known to multiple authorities, including the government’s Prevent counter-extremism programme, which had rejected three referrals by other agencies. In a statement to the House of Commons, home secretary Yvette Cooper later confirmed that multiple agencies had dealt with Rudakubana and “knew about his history of violence”.\n\nLord David Anderson KC had now been appointed to “shine a light” into the counterterror system, said Starmer.\n\nA separate public inquiry into the Southport killings would also raise “questions that should be far-reaching, unhindered by cultural or institutional sensitivities and driven by the pursuit of justice”, he said.\n\n“I will not let institutions of the state deflect from their failure, which in this case frankly jumps off the page,” added the prime minister.\n\nCooper said the government would also now demand that tech companies remove all online violent material accessed by Rudakubana. She also said it was a “total disgrace” that Rudakubana had been able to buy a knife on Amazon despite only being 17 at the time.\n\nStarmer insisted that the law “forbade” him from disclosing what authorities already knew about Rudakubana while the justice process was under way. There have been questions, including from Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, as to why more details of his background were not released sooner.\n\nInitially after the attack, the authorities would not confirm the identity of Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time and was born in Cardiff to parents who had emigrated from Rwanda.\n\nA wave of online misinformation ensued, claiming that the suspect was an illegal asylum seeker, helping to trigger far-right riots in towns and cities for days afterwards.\n\nStarmer, the former head of public prosecutions, said: “If this trial had collapsed because I, or anyone else, had revealed details while the police were investigating . . . then the vile individual who committed these crimes would have walked away a free man.”\n\nCooper insisted that British contempt of court law, which dates back to 1981 and is intended to prevent prejudicial information being released during justice proceedings, underpinned the initial absence of public information in the aftermath of the killings.\n\nIn response, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said that the authorities could nonetheless have released more details than they did.\n\nThe killer’s possession of terror-related material was eventually made public in October, when Rudakubana was charged with further offences, said Philp. “So if it can be made public in October, without risking prejudice of the murder trial, it follows that it could have been made public in August without prejudicing that same trial,” he said.\n\nRudakubana was not charged with committing an act of terrorism because, according to police, a clear motive for the murders had not been established.\n\nSoon after his guilty plea on Monday, it emerged that concerns about Rudakubana’s behaviour had been circulating among agencies for years.\n\nIn 2019, he took a knife into school, prompting the involvement of five agencies, including the police and social services. Two months later, he attacked a fellow pupil with a hockey stick.\n\nPolice were called five times to his house over the three years that followed due to concerns about his behaviour, and he was repeatedly referred to the multi-agency team responsible for child safeguarding in Lancashire, where he lived, as well as to the youth justice system.\n\nStarmer said public agencies would not be allowed to “deflect” questions during the forthcoming public inquiry.\n\nRudakubana is due to be sentenced in Liverpool on Thursday.",

The UK economy expanded by 0.1 per cent in November, following 0.1 per cent contractions in both October and September, according to official data.\n\nInvestor fears about stagflation — when sluggish growth combines with persistent price pressures — contributed to a sharp rise in UK government borrowing costs at the start of the year, although gilt yields fell last week amid expectations of more interest rate cuts.\n\nThe expansion of Britain’s airports has long been a contentious issue, given jets contribute to noise and air pollution, as well as climate change, but two government decisions are expected soon.\n\nTransport secretary Heidi Alexander must decide by February 27 on Gatwick’s plan to bring its standby runway into regular use.\n\nThe work is part of a £2.2bn project that would enable Gatwick to handle up to 75mn passengers a year by the late 2030s, up from the record 46.5mn who used the single-runway airport in 2019.\n\nOne person familiar with the government’s thinking said a go-ahead for the scheme was an “absolutely sure thing” given its economic benefits and relatively straightforward environmental challenges.\n\nGatwick referred to a previous statement in which it said it had put forward a “strong” case for making best use of its existing infrastructure, while minimising noise and environmental impacts.\n\nAlexander must rule by April 3 on Luton airport’s proposals to increase passenger numbers to 32mn each year, up from its current annual limit of 18mn.\n\nGovernment insiders said Luton’s expansion was likely to be approved, but officials are working through how to address concerns about the extra noise over the Chiltern Hills, which are designated as an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nAlberto Martin, chief executive of Luton airport, said expansion of the facility “fully aligns with the government’s sustainable growth agenda by making best use of existing infrastructure”, and would create thousands of jobs.\n\nReeves said last July she wanted Heathrow to expand so long as it met certain environmental criteria, a stance that puts her at odds with energy secretary Ed Miliband and London mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\nA spokesperson for Khan said on Tuesday: “The mayor has a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London — linked to the negative impact on air quality, noise and London’s ability to reach net zero by 2030.”\n\nOne government insider said Heathrow’s third runway remained a “chicken and egg” situation, with the company’s management refusing to commit to the project unless and until it received full backing from ministers.\n\nLabour has said it will allow Heathrow’s expansion if it passes four “tests” set by ministers relating to climate change, noise, air pollution and economic growth.\n\nBut experts doubt Heathrow could pass all the tests even if there were rapid growth in the fledgling market for “sustainable aviation fuel” made from crops and other non-fossil fuels.\n\n“There are live development consent orders on Luton and Gatwick, but it’s worth mentioning there is no live proposal from Heathrow,” said one government official involved in the discussions.\n\nBloomberg reported that Reeves could use her growth speech to announce some of the government’s key decisions on infrastructure projects, and that she could look favourably on a development consent order for a third runway at Heathrow.\n\nHeathrow said growing the economy meant adding capacity at the airport. “That’s why we’re planning to unlock capacity by improving and upgrading our existing infrastructure, while also looking at potential options to deliver a third runway at Heathrow in line with strict tests on carbon, noise and air quality.”\n\nBut Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, told Times Radio that a third runway at Heathrow was not a good idea as it “diverts infrastructure investment away from the north and traps it in London”.\n\nBurnham added that it was “a model for an ever overheating UK economy rather than a more balanced, levelled-up economy”. He said Manchester airport did not operate at full capacity and had potential for expansion. “The right thing to do is to go back to that plan that links modern high-speed [rail] lines north and south, east and west through Manchester airport. And that’s what I would call on the government to do.”\n\nAnother transport project which is set to get the go-ahead from ministers in the coming months is the £9bn Lower Thames Crossing, a new highway and tunnel across the river to the east of London, according to officials.\n\nReeves is expected to use a private finance model for the crossing, with investors securing returns in exchange for bankrolling the project.\n\nA government spokesperson said Labour was determined to get the economy moving and secure the long-term future of the UK’s aviation sector.\n\n“All expansion proposals must demonstrate they contribute to economic growth . . . while remaining in line with existing environmental obligations,” they added.",

    "body": "Good morning. Axel Rudakubana has pleaded guilty to murdering three young girls, 10 charges of attempted murder, the production of the poison ricin and possession of a terrorist training manual.\n\nThe unexpected guilty plea — at the start of the trial Rudakubana had refused even to confirm his name — means that the families of Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar will not have to go through a lengthy trial.\n\nBut like many others, they still have questions about how someone who was referred to Prevent, the UK’s deradicalisation programme, three times between 2019 and 2021 because of his obsession with violence went on to commit three murders in 2024.\n\nThe government has announced a public inquiry into what went wrong. Some thoughts on some of the challenges that the security services and police face and what an inquiry might usefully ask.\n\nIn October, Ken McCallum, MI5’s director-general, gave his annual threat update. One bit in particular has stuck with me (bold emphasis mine):\n\nAlthough Rudakubana has pleaded guilty to possessing Military Studies In The Jihad Against The Tyrants: The Al-Qaeda Training Manual, a terrorist how-to-guide, he appears to have been interested in it for its methods rather than its motive. Ursula Doyle, the prosecutor, described him as “a young man with a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence”. One reason why Rudakubana was not picked up when he should have been is that he did not fit neatly into any of the usual boxes.\n\n(There are also, I think, striking similarities between some of the new threats mentioned by McCallum and the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, where the accused appears to be someone with a “tenuous grasp” of their ideologies.)\n\nAs Keir Starmer said this morning, terrorism has a new face, that alongside “highly organised groups like Al-Qaida”, now “we also see acts of extreme violence perpetrated by loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom, accessing all manner of material online, desperate for notoriety, sometimes inspired by traditional terrorist groups, but fixated on that extreme violence, seemingly for its own sake”. The question this inquiry will seek to answer is how to remodel parts of our counterterror system to identify and tackle that new threat.\n\nJonathan Hall KC, the independent reviewer of the UK’s terrorism legislation, explained the gap in the state’s threat response this morning on the Today programme:\n\nKeir Starmer is right this morning to say that the answer to this question is to expand the definition of terror. At no point has Rudakubana’s case been treated as “terror-related” precisely because of the absence of a clear underlying ideology. That exposes a flaw in how we think about terror and how we identify threats in a changing world.\n\nAlthough the threat profile of people who commit violent offences and violent terror offences is often similar — a man, usually a young man, who is alienated from and hostile to society — the methods by which they are recruited by Islamist extremists or the far right are different. How the security services monitor them and detect them is different. Their targets are different.\n\nThere are some important overlaps in both method and threat, but maintaining that specificity about motive and therefore the method for foiling plots is important. This new form of terrorism, too, has similarities in terms of the people most likely to commit it — but the methods by which we monitor, detect and stop them will also need to change.\n\nI mostly listened to Joan Baez’s Diamonds & Rust while writing my column this week.",

    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK employers cut staff numbers after the Labour government’s tax-raising Budget even as wage growth accelerated, official data showed on Tuesday.\n\nPayrolled employment fell 0.1 per cent between October and November and was 11,000 lower in the three months to November than in the previous quarter, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nEarly estimates for December suggest a bigger month-on-month drop of 47,000 to 30.3mn in the payrolled workforce.\n\nAt the same time, average weekly earnings in the three months to November were 5.6 per cent higher than a year earlier, both including and excluding bonuses — up from 5.2 per cent in the previous period, the ONS said.\n\nThe figures add to mounting evidence that economic growth has faltered and the jobs market weakened following Rachel Reeves’ October Budget, in which businesses bore the brunt of £40bn in tax increases.\n\nAlthough the full impact of the Budget changes would only be seen later in the year, “the warning lights on recruitment, employment and training are already flashing”, said Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, after the data was published.\n\nAn increase in employers’ national insurance contributions and a rise in the minimum wage have combined to leave some sectors facing a sharp jump in their cost of labour when the measures take effect in April.\n\nSurveys suggest businesses will try to offset higher costs by cutting jobs, squeezing wages or passing them on to consumers through higher prices.\n\nPolicymakers at the Bank of England are watching closely to see which of these effects dominates. Analysts said that despite stronger wage growth, which policymakers see as inflationary, Tuesday’s figures reinforced the case to cut interest rates in February.\n\nFigures last week showed UK GDP grew a meagre 0.1 per cent in November, undershooting economists’ forecasts, after mild contractions in September and October.The BoE left rates unchanged at 4.75 per cent last month after cutting borrowing costs twice in 2024. Markets largely expect that the central bank will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter-point in February.\n\nAccording to levels implied in swaps markets, traders anticipate at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year and have priced in a 50 per cent chance of a third.\n\nSterling, which was already weaker on Tuesday after a rebound in the dollar, remained 0.6 per cent lower after the data at $1.2259.\n\nAshley Webb, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said that while rising private sector pay growth would “cause the Bank of England some unease”, more timely figures based on HMRC records suggested that “this latest burst of wage growth is already fading”.\n\nThe figures come as Reeves heads to Davos to make the case for the UK as a destination for international investment, with the government facing increasing criticism for triggering a downturn in the jobs market.\n\n“There is growing evidence that firms have effectively pressed pause on hiring post-Budget,” said Thomas Pugh, economist at the audit firm RSM UK. Although stronger pay growth would make the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee cautious about loosening policy too rapidly over the course of the year, a rate cut in February was “still a sure bet”, he added.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: “73,000 more jobs have been created since the start of the parliament, and wages after inflation are growing at the fastest rate in three years.”",

    "body": "Good morning. Donald Trump’s big bang, day one action on tariffs appeared, at first, to be almost nothing at all: a memo calling for the evaluation of US trade relationships. The memo, reportedly, amounted to no more than giving the sabres a good rattle. It looked like win for the bark>bite view of his presidency, to which Unhedged subscribes, and was consistent with the emphasis on gradual and negotiated tariff policy from most (but not all) of the president’s economic advisers.\n\nMarkets seemed to like it, too, though it is not clear how big a discount the market had already placed on Trump tough talk on tariffs. The dollar had a pretty big decline, suggesting a degree of surprise. The upward shift in equity futures was more muted. At the very least, the non-action seemed to confirm that the administration knows markets doesn’t like tariffs, and it wants markets to be happy.\n\nThe reprieve lasted a few hours. In the evening, Trump told reporters he was “thinking of” putting 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico. “I think we’ll do it February 1,” he said. The dollar reversed course against the currencies of the two countries.\n\nA comment to be taken at face value? Probably not. A negotiating ploy? Almost certainly. But for markets, strategic ambiguity cannot go on forever. Trump likes tariffs and tariff threats. Investors, on the whole, do not. At some point the time for posturing will end and the time for policy will begin.\n\nTrump probably can’t have both continued high corporate profits and a lower trade deficit. And that will not be the only decision he will face. He will also have to balance America becoming “a manufacturing nation again” against realising “massive amounts of money from tariffs”; the two aims suggest very different tariff regimes.\n\nSimilarly, he has promised much lower energy prices and big increases in domestic energy production. He can deliver, at best, one of the two. While the market waits for him to make his compromises, volatility seems like a good bet.\n\nThe president is being no more dishonest than our national tradition allows. It is standard to use the inaugural address to promise every citizen a tax cut, a lower deficit, world peace, and a pony. But any hint about which of his many commitments Trump will pursue, and which he will neglect, will be seized upon by nervous markets. Email us with your view of the president’s true economic priorities: robert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.\n\n**Readers in Washington, DC should immediately sign up for Alphaville’s pub quiz, which is coming to the capital on February 6. These events are a lot of fun and a good way to meet other finance-econ types. Details here.**\n\nLast week, we asked whether UK stocks were as cheap as they looked, relative to US stocks. Our tentative answer was no. When you adjust the two markets’ valuations for expected growth over the next few years, the UK discount looks small. And there are not many companies in the UK indices that look like wonderful bargains. But readers wrote in with some ideas.\n\nSeveral readers suggest comparing HSBC, Lloyd’s and other UK banks to their US counterparts; or BP to ExxonMobil and Chevron. An interesting contrast but, as Unhedged wrote in a discussion of the UK discount two years ago, there are structural reasons that UK oil companies should be cheaper than US ones: US companies have better reserve profiles, and many European institutional investors’ mandates prevent them from owning oil stocks. As for UK banks, they have slower-growing home markets and/or much weaker capital markets and trading operations than their US peers. Readers may disagree, but we don’t see the oil and banking discounts getting meaningfully smaller any time soon.\n\nOthers wrote back to us with interesting comparisons from our list of UK companies with high US exposure, several of which we have added to the table below, along with a few of our own (Tesco does not have high US exposure, but we thought the comparison to Kroger was interesting):\n\nUnlike our European comparisons from last week, there is at least the smell of some bargains here. Some UK companies trade at big discounts to US peers that are not explained by near-term earnings expectations. Medical device maker Smith & Nephew (a company with high US exposure) is much cheaper than Stryker, and the same goes for credit reporting agencies Experian and Equifax.\n\nSeveral UK companies are also valued in the same band as their US counterpart, but give you higher expected growth for your buck: BAE, Tesco, and AstraZeneca. Of course, this is only a starting point. There is much more to explore before declaring the UK half of the pair to be cheap. But it’s something.\n\nMichel Lerner of UBS’s Holt team wrote with another insight into the valuation gap between the S&P 500 and FTSE 100. He noted the difference in valuation has never been greater in terms of free cash flow yield, as his chart of the yields shows:\n\nLerner points out, however, the UK market is packed with value stocks, that is, stocks that are highly cyclical and not particularly profitable through the cycle:\n\nUK growth and quality (high profitability) stocks look “more attractively valued than US peers”, Lerner says, but there just aren’t very many stocks in either category in the UK, especially among big caps.\n\nThe point about market cap brings us to another interesting comparison. Without big tech companies of their own, the European and UK indices somewhat resemble US mid-caps: decent margins, some international exposure, and a high proportion of value companies. The other day we noted there is only about a 10 per cent premium on the S&P 500 large-cap index relative to the EU and UK indices, using a PEG analysis. Here is the same analysis using the S&P 400 mid-cap index:\n\nThough PEG ratio is an imperfect metric, it suggests that the S&P 400 US mid-cap index might be cheaper than the UK and EU big-cap indices. If you are uneasy with the valuations of big-cap US stocks, looking at smaller stocks might make as much sense as looking abroad, or more.\n\n(Reiter and Armstrong)\n\nIn our last letter, we wrote that Peter Navarro was the former US trade representative and Robert Lighthizer was an adviser in the first administration. That was a mix up. Lighthizer was USTR, Navarro was a trade adviser and the director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, an office created by the Trump administration, which was not filled during the Biden administration. Apologies.\n\nThere is big money in cow bile.",

    "body": "Britain is going to experience a data centre bonanza over the next decade — at least, that is the hope of the new Labour government. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is determined to “make the UK irresistible to AI firms looking to start, scale, or grow their business”, and that means clearing away planning obstacles for private-sector investment in the physical infrastructure on which artificial intelligence depends.\n\nBut something has been tripping me up in the recent flurry of announcements about data centre projects: the sheer number of new jobs that appear to be involved. “Over 4,000 jobs will be created” by a £10bn investment by Blackstone in a data centre campus in Northumberland, the government has announced. A separate £14bn-worth of investment in AI infrastructure by three tech companies will “deliver 13,250 jobs across the UK”, Starmer has said. Hang on. Data centres are stuffed with machines, not humans. Microsoft, for example, says its data centre buildings employ about 50 people each. So where are these big job forecasts coming from?\n\nLet’s take the Northumberland project, which envisages 10 data centres built on land that had been slated for the (failed) Britishvolt battery plant. According to the planning documents, the development “is estimated to require up to 40 people per data centre”. Once all 10 centres are built (expected by 2035) that makes 400 jobs, a tenth of the number the government cited.\n\nThe planning documents say “peak monthly construction employment could be in the region of 1,200 jobs” — these aren’t permanent roles but there is likely to be a decade’s worth of construction work on the site, so they aren’t fleeting jobs either. Even so, the operational and construction jobs combined only account for 1,600 jobs. Where are the rest?\n\nNow we enter the murkier realm of economists’ models. It is common practice to estimate the number of “indirect” and “induced” jobs created by a big investment. These are the jobs that will be created in the supply chain and as a result of the new employees spending their money in local pubs, shops and so on. The planning documents for the Northumberland project say that one direct job in a data centre can support between five and seven additional jobs in the local economy and related industries, which “could equate to an additional 2,000 to 2,800 jobs in the local economy once all ten data centre buildings are operational”. Take 2,400 as the midpoint and we have reached the government’s 4,000 number.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume there will be some spillover jobs, but the “multipliers” applied are often derived from models and can vary a lot by sector and country. Blackstone told me the multiplier cited in the planning documents was drawn from PwC research into the impact of data centres in the US, which was commissioned by the Data Center Coalition, the membership association for the industry.\n\nHenry Overman, a professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics, told me that academics tend to find smaller multipliers when they do after-the-fact empirical studies of what happened when new jobs arrived in an area. His study into the impact of the BBC’s decision to move 1,700 medium and high-skilled jobs to Salford in Greater Manchester between 2011 and 2012, for example, found that each BBC job created on average 0.33 additional jobs in the creative industries, rising to 0.55 additional jobs by 2017. He and his colleagues found no significant effect on total employment.\n\nNone of this is to say the project isn’t positive for Northumberland. But for the government, why invite public disappointment or cynicism by bundling all these estimates into one big number, when you could treat people with respect and give them all the details from the start? An alternative could sound something like: “This project will create a moderate number of skilled jobs and a decade’s worth of construction work. It will probably have wider local benefits too, but it’s hard to put a precise number on it.” Admittedly, that might not be eye-catching and boosterish, but my sense is that people are in no mood for eye-catching boosterism these days anyway.\n\nThere are plenty of good arguments for the economic importance of data centres (as well as some concerns about energy and water use), but “they create tonnes of local jobs” isn’t one of them.\n\nIf Starmer wants to revive productivity growth as much as he says he does, he will have to get comfortable talking about the expansion of industries that produce a lot of value without needing many employees. For these new types of sectors, which are capital-intensive but not labour-intensive, the Labour government needs to update its script.\n\nsarah.oconnor@ft.com",

    "blurb": "Sell-off in gilts since Budget suggests market balking at higher borrowing needs, says billionaire investor",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates, has warned that the UK could be heading for a “debt death spiral”, in which it has to borrow more and more money to service its rising interest costs.\n\nDalio told the Financial Times that the recent sell-off in the gilt market, coupled with bouts of sterling weakness, suggested that the market was struggling to absorb the UK’s higher borrowing needs since last October’s Budget.\n\nThe combination of rising annual interest payments, which have already topped £100bn a year, and the need to roll over debt at higher borrowing costs, created the risk of a self-reinforcing cycle, he said.\n\nThis “looks like a debt death spiral in the making because it will either require more borrowing to service the debt that will have to be serviced, squeeze out other spending, or require more taxes”, said Dalio in an interview.\n\nThe market turbulence “reflects a supply-demand problem” for gilts, he said. “Why else would long-term [yields] rise when there’s an easing [of monetary policy], the exchange rate is going down, and the economy is weak?”\n\nHe also said the US is “exhibiting signs” that the market could start to struggle to absorb its borrowing needs, and called getting a handle on the country’s debt burden the “first big issue” for President Trump’s second term in office.\n\nA global bond sell-off in recent months has sent borrowing costs racing higher in big economies such as the UK and US, even as central banks continue to cut interest rates.\n\nThe UK’s 10-year borrowing costs rose from 3.75 per cent in mid-September to a 16-year high earlier this month at 4.93 per cent, amid a global bond sell-off and anxiety over the UK economy. Yields have since recovered some ground to 4.66 per cent on Monday.\n\nUS 10-year yields have reached 4.62 per cent, up one percentage point over the same timeframe. Yields move inversely to prices.\n\nA big driver has been stickier-than-expected inflation, which has led markets to price in shallower rate cuts, but some big investors have also voiced concerns about higher levels of borrowing by countries already carrying large debt burdens.\n\n“When you get to the point that you have to borrow money to service the debt and interest rates are rising, so that debt service payments rise, so you need to borrow more money to pay them, you’re in what the markets call a death spiral,” said Dalio, who this month published the first part of his new analysis of sovereign debt crises, How Countries Go Broke.\n\n“As those risks increase, everybody looks at that need to borrow more money at higher interest, which creates [a] self-reinforcing debt deterioration cycle.”\n\nThe sell-off in sterling and gilts has evoked memories of the market crisis following former Prime Minister Liz Truss’s ill-fated 2022 “mini” Budget. At the time, Dalio wrote that the market plunge “suggests incompetence”.\n\nInvestors have largely dismissed comparisons, partly given the sell-off has not been as large or as sharp, but the government was forced to defend its economic plans this month as its borrowing costs hit a post-financial crisis high, while chancellor Rachel Reeves has faced calls to resign.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson said the government’s “commitment to fiscal rules and sound public finances is non-negotiable”, adding: “The chancellor has already shown that tough decisions on spending will be taken, with the spending review to root out waste ongoing.”\n\nDalio called for US and UK government deficits to be reduced to 3 per cent of GDP. The US deficit is expected to remain above 6 per cent of GDP this year, while the UK’s is set to hit 4.5 per cent this fiscal year.\n\nSome analysts have warned that radical cuts to spending or fresh taxes would damage countries’ economic growth and hit their finances.\n\nDalio accepted that “cutting the budget deficit is depressing for growth and inflation, [but] it will lead to lower interest rates and those lower interest rates have a big stimulative effect while also reducing the budget deficit”.\n\nDalio, who stepped down as Bridgewater’s chair in 2021 but remains on the board, has previously warned of the danger of mounting US debt to Treasuries investors. He did not put a timeframe on when what he has termed a “debt bomb” would go off for indebted countries.\n\n“It’s like a person who has a lot of plaque in their arteries that’s building up fast,” he said. Debt payments are “building up and squeezing out other spending and creating the risk of a piece of the plaque breaking off. You can’t tell exactly when that is going to happen, but you can say that the risks are very high and rising.”",

But illegal drug taking doesn’t just harm users: the surge in cocaine sales in western Europe has also seen a surge in violence in Ecuador and the Caribbean, according to the UN.\n\nThat’s the unanswerable argument as to why the UK should emulate New York or the Netherlands and legalise cannabis: the attempt to reduce drug usage through prohibition has been a failure with many innocent casualties. In the year leading up to March 2024 in England and Wales, 8.8 per cent of people reported taking some kind of illegal drug. And 11.9 per cent did the same for cigarettes. The important difference is that the tenth of the population who smoke cigarettes are filling government coffers with taxes and doing themselves great harm. The 8.8 per cent are doing absolutely nothing for the government finances while doing great harm to others.\n\nThe bloody consequences of prohibition are that, when you buy illegal drugs, you are financing violence, murder and criminality across the supply chain. But those consequences are also predictable: no one who buys cannabis, let alone cocaine, does so in the mistaken belief that the person they are WhatsApping is just an employee of the local corner shop going the extra mile.\n\nAcross the world, we liberal reformers have done a better job of winning the argument against government prohibition than we have making the argument that we all, whether as governments or just consumers, have a responsibility to act ethically. There is a moral difference, and not just a regulatory one, in whether a New Yorker buys weed from an illicit dealer or a legal dispensary. That moral difference goes right to the heart of the argument for legalising most drugs: that the legal supply chain has fewer social harms than the illegal one. And those of us who want to change our drug laws should say so: we should argue that it is both shameful for governments to perpetuate prohibition and shameful for individual customers to buy illegal drugs.\n\nWhen governments prohibit drugs, they are prioritising “protecting” people from the consequences of their free choices at the cost of endangering others. When people buy illegal drugs, they are choosing to put their wants ahead of other people’s lives. There is no other policy area where governments visibly fail to achieve the stated aim of a policy — in this case, reducing the number of people who take illegal drugs — in a way that significantly increases human suffering (of people caught in the supply chain of those drugs) and where persisting with this policy is seen as hard-headed and sensible, and not doubling down on disaster.\n\nThe reality is that everyone involved in the global attempt to reduce the harms of drug usage through prohibition and punishment should be ashamed. Governments should be ashamed of a policy that hasn’t worked and causes a great deal of suffering. Drug users should be ashamed of making a choice that they know full well causes suffering and misery. And those of us who want a shift in policy should be ashamed both that we have largely failed to change opinion and that we often hold back from pointing out how shamefully almost everyone involved in this whole sorry mess behaves.\n\nstephen.bush@ft.com\n\n​Letters in response to this column:\n\nWar on drugs is the 21st century’s big challenge / From Annette Idler, Associate Professor in Global Security, Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, UK\n\nDrug demand among the professional classes is key / From Mike Davis, Antwerp, Belgium",

    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Building a global retail bank is hard work. If Santander decides to pull out of the UK, it could find dismantling a global retail bank is no easier.\n\nThe Spanish banking group is considering the future of its British arm, built by rolling up former building societies like Abbey National in the 2000s. The frustrations are obvious: high costs, fairly low recent returns and slow growth.\n\nAt first glance, exiting the UK might seem as easy as cutting along the dotted line. Watchdogs already demand UK retail banks be legally ringfenced from international and investment banking operations. However, Santander has spent years working to centralise the back-end systems that power its different businesses. Attempted disentanglements at rivals like Deutsche Bank and Sabadell have run into problems.\n\nEven if boss Ana Botín succeeds, she might find she has opened a Pandora’s box that is hard to shut. Santander has always defended its business model — with retail banks in 10 “core” markets — by arguing that markets going through temporary troubles are offset by stronger ones.\n\nThat has been vindicated in the past. At times in the 2010s, the UK was Santander’s most profitable market, while its US business underperformed. In later years, though, the US reported higher profits than the bank’s foundational Spanish division. If Botín is now of the view that laggard businesses should be put up for sale, it will be harder to dismiss demands for shrinking further.\n\nThen there’s the challenge of finding a buyer. A combination with local UK rivals Barclays or NatWest would create the largest mortgage lender in the country, with more than 20 per cent market share. That would not be an encouraging development for regulators that have spent the last 15 years complaining that the UK banking sector is too concentrated.\n\nEither way, nothing will happen quickly. Look at rival Citigroup, which vowed in 2022 to divest its Mexican retail business Banamex. After failing to find a buyer at a reasonable price, chief executive Jane Fraser decided to list the business instead. Now she says that might take until 2026 — which will mark four years of trying to cut the division loose.\n\nIt makes sense that Botín would be considering her options. Santander’s share price has fallen 30 per cent since she succeeded her father as chair in 2014. If the latest deal talk flushes out a prospective buyer with an offer that is too good to refuse, the group would be remiss to ignore it. But backing out of Britain is no quick fix.\n\nnicholas.megaw@ft.com",

    "event_name": "Parkrun comes of age: six of its best international 5ks ",
    "blurb": "The free running event turns 21 this year — and its continuing global expansion makes it an excellent way to see another side of a city ",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "What does the perfect trip to a new city include? Perhaps finding a good café, meeting some locals and a spot of gentle exercise while taking in some sights away from the overcrowded tourist traps? What if I told you that you could do all of this, in around an hour? In 2,500 locations in more than 20 countries. For free.\n\nParkrun, the London-founded mass-participation 5k running event that turns 21 this year, is a compelling proposition for the exercise-keen but time-poor traveller. All you need is a spare Saturday morning, a pair of running shoes and a phone/watch-based “barcode”, Parkrun’s system for identifying you and recording your runs, wherever you may be.\n\nMuch of Parkrun’s appeal lies in its fusion of a community-led core with a warm welcome for Parkrun tourists, whose home event might be hundreds or thousands of miles away.\n\nRelying strictly on volunteers for course set-up, marshalling and timekeeping, Parkrun insists the event will be “free forever”. As crowdsourced events go, it’s less “gig economy”, more “jog economy” — a model that has found favour with an increasingly international network of enthusiasts.\n\nInternational expansion has not been without issues. In response to the invasion of Ukraine, Parkrun suspended events across Russia in 2022 (prompting Russians to create their own copycat replacement).\n\nIn France, Parkruns have also been suspended since 2022 due to the French Athletics Federation requiring runners taking part in sporting activities to either be licensed or have completed an online safety course — something that Parkrun says would be impractical to enforce at its volunteer-led events.\n\nNevertheless, international Parkruns are an excellent way to see a different side to a city. In my experience, they tend to be smaller events than those in the UK, offering a more intimate mix of locals, expats and tourists.\n\nIn the US, home to more than 75 Parkrun events, I’ve run on Roosevelt Island in Washington DC and at Boston’s Jamaica Pond, each tucked far away from their respective city centres. In both locations, there was a warm welcome from locals clearly taking pride in attracting visitors to their events.\n\nWhile the experience was new, the logistics were reassuringly the same as at my local Parkrun: a first-timer’s briefing to talk through the route, a welcome from the event director at the start and plenty of marshalls to guide and cheer runners along to the finish.\n\nParkrun 5k events always take place on a Saturday morning. For business travellers, if your schedule allows, it’s a great way to sneak in some off-the-beaten-track tourism and flush out the remnants of jet lag at the same time. Many events start at 9am, though times vary internationally (clue: earlier start times are usually correlated with hotter climes). Always check an event’s web page in addition to Parkrun’s international cancellations page before setting out as events can be postponed at short notice due to weather or adverse course conditions.\n\nRemember, it’s a timed run, not a race. Some of the best Parkruns are those where you take the time to enjoy the surroundings rather than seek a personal best. “Parkwalking” — completing the course in a leisurely stroll — is increasingly popular, in South Africa accounting for nearly 30 per cent of those completing the event.\n\nThose seeking a more competitive angle will nevertheless enjoy tracking their efforts alongside their peers. Finishing times for all events are published online, along with an age-graded performance score, allowing for comparisons between young and old.\n\nHere are six Parkruns I’ve picked from across FT Globetrotter’s network of cities based on my own experience and enthusiastic reports from international runners.\n\nI’ve picked the original event that started the Parkrun movement, but runners in the UK’s capital are spoiled for choice — there are 65 events within Greater London. Complete them all and you have LonDone them. Bushy Park, which hosted the very first event of 13 runners in 2004, saw over 6,000 finishers for its 1,000th event in August 2024.\n\nFor many Parkrunners, completing Bushy Parkrun is a pilgrimage, as I found out on a frosty January morning this year. I joined more than 150 Bushy “first-timers” in a field of 1,345 runners for a bracing run through the park. It’s flat, fast and beautiful throughout its single long lap — just keep an eye out for the deer that roam the park.\n\nVolkspark Niddatal is Frankfurt’s largest green space with an abundance of trails through its open and wooded areas, making it an ideal setting for this flat, fast two-lap figure-of-eight course. The event is praised by business-trip Parkrunners for its warm welcome and English-language first timers briefing, and you can join locals afterwards in trying to hunt down the Mounir Coffee Trike that services the park.\n\nIn a similar vein to Frankfurt, Italy’s largest Parkrun offers a largely flat, two-lap course in a park on the city’s outskirts, this time the 640-hectare Parco Nord. Parkrun tourists report a warm welcome from locals, who’ll happily chat with you over a coffee at Bar Enigma on Viale Giovanni Suzzani.\n\nOne of several Parkruns in the Greater Vancouver area. I’ve picked this one in Burnaby because it’s easily accessible by public transport and the route in a historical forest park is graced with native west North American tree species like western hemlock, and western red cedar. Another option is to head for the Spanish Banks Beach Parkrun, where a 2k walk to the start from the nearest bus station is followed by an out-and-back 5k on the waterfront gravel . . .\n\nMelbourne — and Australia — is awash with Parkruns, so why not aim for something more adventurous? Bring your trail-running shoes to experience Brimbank’s hills and bridges, noting the 8am start time. Well-earned post-run coffees are available at Lumbar & Co.\n\nThis course is around 25 minutes away from Tokyo Station, but again note the start time is 8am, the same as all the other 39 Parkruns in Japan. A classic “park” route that involves one lap around a baseball field, followed by two larger laps of the park. Join locals for a post-run coffee at the park’s charming shop/café.\n\nHave you done any Parkruns at home or abroad? Which are your favourites?

    "blurb": "Peter Mandelson has not set deadline for fully divesting of his stock in Global Counsel",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Lord Peter Mandelson will still hold shares in the lobbying firm he co-founded as he takes up his new post as the UK’s ambassador in Washington, despite the company’s work for Chinese clients such as TikTok and links to a prominent ex-adviser to Barack Obama.\n\nMandelson is expected to sell his stake in Global Counsel over time but has not set a deadline for fully divesting, according to people familiar with the matter. He is due to start next month as Britain’s emissary to President Donald Trump.\n\nOne of the people said Mandelson was expected to put the shares, worth millions of pounds, in a “blind trust” to ensure compliance with UK government rules until they are sold off.\n\nThe former New Labour veteran, whom UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer selected over career diplomats, was the second-largest shareholder in Global Counsel with a 28 per cent stake as of June 2024, according to filings at UK Companies House. The people said his stake was smaller now.\n\nThe firm was valued at £30mn last year when The Messina Group, the political consultancy founded by former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, bought a 20 per cent stake.\n\nNicknamed “the Prince of Darkness” for his ability as a political operator, Mandelson was a controversial pick for the ambassador job.\n\nHe had previously called Trump a “danger to the world” and “little short of a white nationalist”. One of Trump’s top campaign strategists called Mandelson “an absolute moron” when his appointment was announced last month.\n\nThe 71-year-old was a minister in Sir Tony Blair’s New Labour government but had to resign twice. He also served under Gordon Brown. Mandelson co-founded Global Counsel in 2010 and later served as president of the Great Britain-China Centre, an arm of the UK Foreign Office. In the past he has encouraged western governments to be pragmatic in dealing with China.\n\nIn a Fox News article last week, Mandelson praised Trump’s “great skill” as a campaigner and said Beijing “now directly challenges western governments and our values”.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter said Mandelson’s stake in Global Counsel had declined to about 20 per cent in the past few months. The firm’s clients have included companies such as Anglo American, JPMorgan, OpenAI, Palantir and Sequoia — but also several China-linked companies.\n\nGlobal Counsel lobbied for TikTok in the UK between July and September last year, according to the British lobbying regulator. TikTok remains a client, according to a person familiar with Global Counsel’s work.\n\nThe US has legislated to ban TikTok unless its owner ByteDance divests the company because of fears the app could be wielded by Beijing for espionage or to spread propaganda. TikTok has denied that it is under the influence of the Chinese government. Trump has said he is looking to allow TikTok to remain available to US users.\n\nGlobal Counsel until last year also advised fast-fashion group Shein, which was founded in China but is now based in Singapore, according to the person familiar with the firm’s work.\n\nShein, which has been exploring a flotation in the UK, has faced allegations that minority Uyghur people are being used as forced labour in cotton supply chains in China’s Xinjiang region, some of which has made its way into Shein products. The company insists it complies with all laws and regulations of the countries in which it operates.\n\nMandelson in 2021 was the only Labour peer in the House of Lords to vote against an amendment aimed at calling out alleged genocide in Xinjiang province. He later told colleagues that having a “general genocide definition in the formulation of foreign policy” could be too sweeping and leave the government with its hands tied.\n\nGlobal Counsel in 2020 also provided advice to Canyon Bridge, the person familiar with the firm’s work said. Canyon Bridge is a US-based venture company backed by Chinese funds including China Reform Holdings, a Chinese state-owned venture fund. Its portfolio includes British graphics chipmaker Imagination Technologies.\n\nIn 2020 Canyon Bridge tried to appoint four China Reform-linked directors to Imagination’s board but abandoned the move after an intervention by the UK government, the Financial Times previously reported.\n\nGlobal Counsel made a loss of £1.85mn in 2023. Mandelson stepped down as a director in the wake of the deal with Messina but became president and chair of Global Counsel’s international advisory board.\n\nMandelson and Global Counsel declined to comment. Asked about Mandelson’s links with China, Starmer’s spokesman said: “We are confident that when President Trump comes to review his credentials he will come to see the considerable experience that Lord Mandelson has and why he would make an excellent ambassador.”",

    "blurb": "Treasury approach to Supreme Court a blow to consumer groups but chancellor fears damage to sector",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Monday launched a bid to shield car loan providers from multibillion-pound payouts in a landmark mis-selling case, after the Treasury warned it could damage Britain’s reputation as a place to do business.\n\nThe Treasury has taken the unusual step of seeking permission to intervene in a forthcoming Supreme Court case, amid concerns that banks and other lenders could face a compensation bill costing tens of billions of pounds.\n\nReeves fears that the case could cause chaos in the motor finance and car industry, making it harder for consumers to get loans. About 80 per cent of new vehicles in the UK are bought on finance.\n\nIf the Treasury is successful, it will deal a blow to consumer groups and claims management companies that have been encouraging car finance customers to file complaints to the Financial Ombudsman.\n\nShares in Lloyds Banking Group and Close Brothers rose 4 per cent and 21.6 per cent respectively on Tuesday after the Financial Times reported the Treasury’s attempt to intervene in the case.\n\nLloyds owns the country’s largest car finance lender Black Horse. Close Brothers has the highest relative exposure to the sector and has lost more than half of its market value over the past year.\n\n“In our view, there has been a clear sentiment change from both the regulator [Financial Conduct Authority] and the government on this topic in the last two months, with both institutions rallying behind the banks,” said Benjamin Toms, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nReeves, who is at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week trying to drum up investment in Britain, fears the huge potential payouts would have a chilling effect on the banking sector, stunt growth and damage the UK’s pro-business reputation, according to people close to the chancellor.\n\nSantander was reconsidering its presence in the UK, according to people familiar with the matter, as it contends with lower returns on its ringfenced business relative to other markets. In November, it set aside £295mn to cover the potential costs of mis-sold car loans.\n\nIn April, the Supreme Court is due to hear an appeal brought by car loan providers challenging an October ruling from the Court of Appeal that sided with consumers who complained about “secret” commissions on car loans.\n\nThe judgment that it was unlawful for banks to pay a commission to a car dealer without the customer’s informed consent sent shockwaves through the UK banking system and triggered thousands of pounds in compensation payments from lenders FirstRand Bank and Close Brothers.\n\nHSBC analysts have estimated the total cost of compensation could reach £44bn, echoing the £50bn paid out by banks after the scandal of the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.\n\nIn a submission to the Supreme Court, seen by the Financial Times, the Treasury claims the case has “potential to cause considerable economic harm and could impact the availability and cost of motor finance for consumers”.\n\nThe Treasury application said that the case might “generate a perception that regulation in the UK is uncertain”. Last week, Reeves called in regulators to push them into sweeping away rules that hinder growth.\n\nIt also argued that if liability was established, then the Treasury would seek to persuade the Supreme Court that “any remedy should be proportionate to the loss actually suffered by the consumer and avoid conferring a windfall”.\n\nTreasury officials argue that rather than taking sides with the banks against wronged consumers, the government wants to maintain the viability of a finance sector vital for the purchase of both new and second-hand cars.\n\n“If lenders have broken the law then consumers should receive compensation proportionate to the losses they have suffered,” said one Reeves ally.\n\n“However, the chancellor’s concerned that the judgment risks using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. That would be bad for consumers and bad for the industry.”\n\nJudges including Lord Reed, president of the Supreme Court, and his deputy Lord Hodge are due to hear the landmark case at the start of April.\n\nThe Supreme Court, which replaced the appellate committee of the House of Lords as the UK’s highest court in 2009, permits official bodies to apply to intervene in cases it hears.\n\nPermission is granted only if the court thinks the intervention will offer “significant assistance” to the judges who will hear the case.\n\nThe Treasury’s move will be welcomed by UK lenders, which have held urgent talks with the government to warn of potential turmoil in the consumer credit sector. Part of the discussions have centred around the possibility that the government would introduce new legislation, said a person familiar with the debates.\n\nLloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn has also previously called on the government to step in as he warned that the October court ruling had fuelled an “investability problem” for the UK.",

    "blurb": "UK chancellor favours proposals by financial regulator for banks to take more risks to boost home ownership",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has backed plans by the UK financial watchdog to examine ways of allowing more mortgage risk-taking by banks to help more people own their own homes.\n\nThe chancellor told the Financial Times that she welcomed proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority to lift limits on mortgages and was “absolutely open to looking at ideas that can boost home ownership and help working families get on the housing ladder”.\n\nReeves is heading to Davos this week to tout the UK as an investment destination at the World Economic Forum as the Labour government tries to bolster growth after the economy flatlined in the second half of last year.\n\nWith her self-imposed fiscal rules under pressure and business sentiment suffering following her decision in October’s Budget to raise employer national insurance contributions, the chancellor has been under heavy political pressure since the start of the year.\n\nThe Treasury has been at the heart of the government’s effort to push regulators to come up with growth-enhancing measures. Reeves met many of the UK’s rulemakers last week to hear their ideas.\n\n“My greatest concern is we are regulated for risk whilst ignoring growth,” Reeves said. “We need to make sure regulators are also taking into account the impact of their policies on growth — that is what we are determined to do as a reforming government.”\n\nThe FCA said in its letter to the prime minister published on Friday that it would “begin simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and opening a discussion on the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults”.\n\nUK mortgage lending is controlled by a mixture of rules from the FCA and the Bank of England, most of which were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis when several banks had to be bailed out by the state.\n\nThe rules restrict how much banks can lend as a multiple of a person’s income or the value of a property and require affordability tests to check if borrowers can cope with future interest rate rises.\n\n“Home ownership declined under the last government and we are determined to turn that around,” Reeves said, adding that the Treasury would “look at the FCA’s ideas in this area”.\n\nThe proportion of households that owned their own accommodation fell from 64.3 per cent in 2011 to 62.5 per cent in 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nRichard Donnell, executive director at property portal Zoopla, said the “big hurdle” preventing more people from getting a mortgage was the FCA’s requirement to stress test affordability, which means banks have to test if borrowers can cope with a rise in borrowing costs.\n\nReeves has come under fire in recent weeks after leaving herself a slender £9.9bn margin of error against her budget rule of funding day-to-day government spending from tax receipts by 2029/30. That margin is at risk of being erased by any renewed surge in bond yields.\n\nShe said the Budget had got the balance right when it came to headroom against her rule and that the forecast in March from the Office for Budget Responsibility would rely on a host of factors, not just bond yields.\n\nWhile global markets had experienced “headwinds”, the fiscal rules remained “non-negotiable”, Reeves added. That meant she would not be making any changes to the rules published at the time of the Budget, she added.\n\nAsked if she could rule out tax increases in March to ensure she met those rules, Reeves reiterated that “we are not having a Budget in March . . . my commitment to one fiscal event a year remains”.\n\nReeves acknowledged that the Budget, which has been heavily criticised by business leaders for raising employer NI and wage costs, had involved taking “difficult decisions”. But she insisted they were the right ones to get the economy back on a firm footing.\n\nShe had yet to hear a serious alternative to the measures, she said.\n\n“Just imagine the alternative, if I hadn’t made those difficult decisions to put the public finances on a firm footing, what that would have done to market confidence in Britain,” she said. “I had to deal with the inheritance I had. That meant making difficult decisions but they are right decisions to get our economy back on a firm footing.”\n\nSpeaking before Donald Trump’s inauguration as US president, Reeves said the fact that he was “obviously a deals person” made her hopeful that “there is scope” to negotiate a trade deal with the new administration.\n\nWhile talks are yet to start, the chancellor said any trade deal with Washington “would have to be right for the UK”, adding that Labour would not ditch its existing position barring imports of US chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-fed beef.",

    "blurb": "Construction may not begin on some projects until 2039, says health secretary Wes Streeting",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "A flagship government programme to build or expand 40 hospitals in England has been delayed by at least a decade. UK health secretary Wes Streeting announced on Monday that work on several hospitals could start as late as 2039, in a blow to health leaders grappling with a crumbling system. The New Hospital Programme, first announced by former Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson, aimed to build or expand 40 hospitals by 2030, backed by about £22bn of capital funding.When it took office in July, Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour government announced it would review the scheme, which was already suffering delays due to a lack of funding.Setting out the new timetable on Monday, Streeting told MPs the building work would take place in four “waves” and that nine schemes under the programme would not start construction until between 2035 and 2039. He did not set a deadline for when the entire scheme would be delivered. He said his department would “put the programme on a firm footing with sustainable funding so all the projects can be delivered”.\n\nNHS bosses had previously warned that patient safety was being put at risk by ministers after the chancellor announced the programme was under evaluation.\n\nSeven hospitals in the programme, constructed almost entirely from potentially dangerous reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, also known as Raac, were not considered under the scope of the review.\n\nStreeting told MPs on Monday that hospitals already under construction were not part of the review and that building works had continued.\n\nHe said the delayed timetable was “honest”, adding: “I know patients in some parts of the country will be disappointed by this new timetable. They are right to be.”\n\nThe health secretary said patients had been “led up the garden path by three Conservative prime ministers, all promising hospitals with no credible plan for funding to deliver them”.\n\nThe programme has been criticised in recent years, with the House of Commons’ public accounts committee warning that the plans were backed with “insufficient funding”.\n\nIn July 2023, the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, said planning problems and funding cuts meant only 32 of the 40 hospitals were due to be completed on schedule.\n\nA landmark report into the state of the NHS last month found England had spent almost £37bn less than peer countries on health assets and infrastructure since the 2010s, forcing the health service to raid capital budgets in order to manage day-to-day spending.\n\nThis capital investment shortfall had left the service with crumbling buildings and led to a maintenance backlog of £13.8bn, it found.\n\nSaffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health organisations across England, said the delay “will come as a major blow to trusts, their staff, patients and communities, many of whom now face even longer delays getting desperately needed new hospitals”.\n\nShe added: “Hospital rebuilds are vital to transforming services, improving safety, and delivering better quality of care for patients after years of under-investment in the bricks and mortar of the NHS.”",

    "body": "A teenager has pleaded guilty to murdering three young girls in a “meticulously planned” knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in north-west England in July last year.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 18, admitted to the attack in Southport at the opening of his trial. Not guilty pleas had previously been entered on Rudakubana’s behalf after he refused to speak at an earlier hearing, and he had been due to stand trial for several weeks.\n\nHe also pleaded guilty to possessing an al-Qaeda training manual and of producing the deadly poison ricin, as well as 10 charges of attempted murder.\n\nBebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, were killed in the stabbings, which led to national outrage and sparked some of the worst rioting in the UK in decades.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper announced a public inquiry into the murders on Monday, to “get to the truth about what happened and what needs to change”.\n\nSpeaking outside Liverpool Crown Court after Monday’s conviction, prosecutor Ursula Doyle called the attack a “meticulously planned rampage”.\n\nShe said Rudakubana was “a young man with a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence” who “showed no signs of remorse”.\n\nThe conviction is likely to raise questions about the role of local agencies and the security services in monitoring Rudakubana’s previous behaviour, including any involvement of the government’s counter-extremism Prevent programme.\n\nThe security services have so far refused to confirm or deny whether he was known to them or on any watchlist, on the basis that the killings had not been motivated by terrorism.\n\nSir Keir Starmer on Monday said there were “grave questions to answer as to how the state failed in its ultimate duty to protect these young girls” and vowed to “leave no stone unturned” in finding answers.\n\nHe added: “The news that the vile and sick Southport killer will be convicted is welcome.”\n\nFurther details of the teenager’s past behaviour may emerge at his sentencing on Thursday.\n\nPosting on X, formerly Twitter, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said a “complete account” was needed of “who in government knew what and when”.\n\nFollowing sentencing, she said, there would be “many important questions the authorities will need to answer about the handling of this case and the flow of information”.\n\nRudakubana refused to confirm his name at the start of his trial on Monday, but not long into the proceedings he broke his silence and changed his pleas on all 16 charges.\n\nThe charges included possession of an electronic document titled Military Studies In The Jihad Against The Tyrants: The Al-Qaeda Training Manual.\n\nRicin was found during police searches of his home in Banks, Lancashire, alongside the training manual.\n\nDespite the discovery of the document, the authorities have not deemed the killings to be a terrorist attack.\n\nMr Justice Goose, the trial judge, told Rudakubana that he faced life imprisonment. Survivors and relatives of the victims were not in court to hear him plead guilty, as they had been expecting the trial to start in earnest on Tuesday.\n\nRiots erupted across the country in July after reports circulated online falsely identifying the perpetrator as an illegal immigrant or asylum seeker who had recently arrived in the country by boat.\n\nFar-right influencers and conspiracy theorists exploited public horror at the knife attack to whip up tensions and stoke anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nRudakubana was born in Cardiff to parents who had emigrated from Rwanda. He was 17 at the time of the attack. Reporting restrictions originally prevented him from being named, but a judge lifted them to prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\nFor more than a week after the killings, sporadic violence continued to break out in towns and cities across England, including in Southport itself.\n\nA hundred miles away in Rotherham, a mob set fire to a hotel housing asylum seekers, barricading the windows and chanting racist abuse. In several areas, police officers were injured in the resulting violence.\n\nDozens of rioters have since been convicted of public order offences, some of them racially aggravated and some carried out online.\n\nRudakubana was initially charged with murder and attempted murder. It was only three months after the attack — following what Merseyside Police said was a “lengthy and complex investigation” — that he was charged with possession of ricin and the document.\n\nMerseyside’s chief constable Serena Kennedy said at the time that “motivation” would need to be established for a matter to be declared a terrorist incident.\n\nSouthport’s Labour MP Patrick Hurley told the BBC that there was “surprise and shock” locally at Rudakubana’s sudden guilty plea on Monday.\n\nThe town, and particularly those families close to the case, had been “bracing” themselves for several weeks of trial, he said.\n\n“I’m very pleased . . . they’re not going to be put through that mental torture now,” he added.",

    "body": "The Bank of England said it is considering setting up a “concierge service” to help foreign companies looking to establish a UK operation, as it responded to the government’s request for growth-enhancing measures.\n\nThe central bank has been studying a similar service that is already offered by Singapore, Sam Woods, head of the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority, said in his letter to the prime minister published on Monday.\n\nThe government has called on the PRA and 16 other UK regulators to present ideas for rule changes that could increase risk-taking and investment in the economy. Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to “rip up” bureaucracy as he seeks to deliver on his promise to boost growth.\n\nWoods said the PRA “recognises and strongly supports” the government’s focus on enhancing growth and “responsible risk-taking”. But he made clear that its main objective was still to preserve financial stability, without which growth would suffer.\n\n“Our primary objectives speak mainly to stability, which is the basis for a predictable economic environment that allows households and businesses to be confident in planning ahead and making investment and hiring decisions,” he said.\n\nThe PRA listed several measures it has already outlined to reduce the burden of regulation, such as delaying the introduction of the global Basel III agreement on bank capital in the UK, simplifying capital rules for insurers, and lifting the cap on bankers’ bonuses.\n\nIts letter to the prime minister, which was also sent to chancellor Rachel Reeves and business secretary Jonathan Reynolds, contained relatively few new proposals beyond the concierge service and a commitment to remove overlapping regulations.\n\nA similar letter from the head of the Financial Conduct Authority to the prime minister that was published last week contained a number of new proposals, including considering scaling back rules on mortgage lending and anti-money laundering checks.\n\nReeves used her first Mansion House speech last November to accuse financial regulators of going too far with rules introduced after the 2008 financial crisis and “regulating for risk, but not regulating for growth”.\n\nWoods said he “would like to explore with colleagues in HM Treasury and the Department for Business and Trade whether there are wider changes which could help to simplify and rationalise the UK regulatory regime or support UK growth in other ways”.\n\nHe said the PRA would free insurers from needing pre-emptive authorisation of investments by allowing retrospective permission. He added that the regulator would also outline plans to cut banks’ reporting requirements this year, having already cut them by a third for insurers.\n\nThe PRA could work with the FCA, the UK’s Office for Investment and other stakeholders to present proposals for a concierge service later this year, Woods said.",

    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government has rejected a bid by unionist parties in Northern Ireland to block the application of new EU rules in the region, in a move that opens the door to closer harmonisation of post-Brexit regulations with Brussels.\n\nUnionists sought to trigger the so-called “Stormont brake” just before Christmas in a bid to halt the application of updated EU legislation on the labelling of chemicals.\n\nHilary Benn, Northern Ireland secretary, said on Monday that he recognised the “sincere and genuine concerns” raised but concluded that the key test — whether the amended laws would have significant and lasting impact on everyday life — had not been met.\n\nThe brake was introduced in 2023 under the Windsor framework governing post-Brexit trading arrangements. It allowed objections to be raised in the “most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort”.\n\nIn order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after the UK left the EU in 2020, Northern Ireland retained access to the EU’s single market for goods. But that meant still accepting some EU law, upsetting hardline unionists who say that undermines their sovereignty as part of the UK.\n\nBenn held out the prospect that Britain could seek to avoid trade barriers emerging in future by aligning its laws with EU rules in force in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn his decision, which comes as the UK seeks to reset relations with Brussels, Benn said there was “no room for complacency in terms of potential impacts”.\n\nThe UK was committed to taking steps to avoid the emergence of barriers to trade in chemicals between Britain and Northern Ireland and to ensure the smooth operation of the UK internal market — including, if necessary, aligning British and Northern Irish regulatory regimes for the sector, Benn said in a letter to Edwin Poots, speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\n“The government will explicitly consult on applying a consistent regime across the United Kingdom, should this be required to safeguard the UK internal market,” Benn said. “The government intends to launch this consultation as soon as possible.”\n\nThat prospect is not a blanket plan to ensure British and EU laws align across the board; the UK would take a case-by-case view regarding any future objections in other sectors.\n\nGavin Robinson, whose Democratic Unionist party is the largest pro-UK party, called the government’s decision “wrong” and “a grave mistake that will exacerbate trade friction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland”.\n\nSteve Aiken, of the smaller Ulster Unionist party, said the regulations had demonstrated “increasing and significant divergence from our largest market, our own country. That this is the case should be readily apparent to the secretary of state, if he just bothered to look.”\n\nHe said in a statement: “Northern Ireland is far from being in the ‘best of both worlds’ and Hilary Benn had an opportunity to actually examine the impact of this divergence, he has demonstrably failed at this first hurdle.”\n\nMatthew O’Toole, of the Social Democratic and Labour party and the opposition leader in the assembly, said that instead of “continual debate” about the Stormont brake, “we need the secretary of state and the UK government to engage with the EU around a permanent solution that recognises Northern Ireland’s unique position and allows us to make the most of dual market access”.\n\nThe DUP boycotted Stormont for two years over Brexit trade rules, paralysing local politics, and the assembly and power-sharing executive were only restored in February last year.\n\nAnalysts said they did not expect unionists to cause similar disruption after the Stormont brake setback.",

    "blurb": "Financial Times FOI request reveals unusual lack of formal commendation for appointment flagged by security services",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Boris Johnson nominated a Russian newspaper owner for a seat in the House of Lords without giving any formal rationale for his appointment, according to newly disclosed information from the commission that vets nominees.\n\nEvgeny Lebedev, also a British citizen, was given a seat for life in the upper chamber of parliament as part of the former prime minister’s list of political peerages in July 2020, becoming Baron Lebedev of Hampton in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and of Siberia in the Russian Federation.\n\nHis appointment as a peer triggered a backlash when it emerged in media reports that the House of Lords Appointments Commission (Holac) had been warned against Lebedev’s nomination because of the national security risks associated with the Evening Standard and Independent owner’s family background.\n\nHolac’s eight commissioners, three of whom represent the main political parties while the rest are non-political, usually receive a letter of citation for each nominee, but “did not receive a citation for Mr Lebedev at the time of his appointment”, according to a response to a freedom of information request submitted by the Financial Times.\n\nAlexander Lebedev, Evgeny’s father, was an officer in the KGB and one of its successor agencies, the FSB. Alexander has since had sanctions imposed upon him by Canada for directly enabling “Vladimir Putin’s senseless war in Ukraine” and by Ukraine for being “directly or indirectly controlled by residents of a foreign state”.\n\nThe Security Service also gave Johnson an in-person briefing in Downing Street about the risks associated with Evgeny’s nomination to the Lords, after the former prime minister decided to go ahead with it despite knowing about the security advice that had been given to Holac.\n\nHolac declined to comment on the specifics of Lebedev’s nomination. But it welcomed a recent decision by the government to publish citations for nominees. The public body, which cannot veto nominees, vets them by looking at potential misconduct after asking for their consent.\n\nLord Michael Jay, who chaired Holac between 2008 and 2013, said: “I don’t recall proposals with no citation at all — but some I think just said who the person was without much or any explanation as to why he or she was being put forward.”\n\nLord George Foulkes, a Labour peer who sat on parliament’s intelligence and security committee, said: “I have expressed concern about Lord Lebedev’s peerage, principally on security grounds but also because he hardly ever attends. I am considering the best way to pursue this further, including referring it to the Honours Forfeiture Committee.”\n\nA spokesperson for Johnson said: “This is nonsense, every person nominated to the Lords goes through the appropriate process which is conducted by officials. Lord Lebedev’s outstanding contribution to British journalism was made clear in that process. The security services did not advise against this appointment.”\n\nEvgeny Lebedev’s private office did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "blurb": "Richard Blakeway says toxic metal is going ‘undetected’ and should be treated as seriously as asbestos ",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "England’s housing ombudsman has called for a survey of properties to assess the presence of lead, after the impact of the toxic metal on human health was highlighted by a Financial Times investigation.\n\nRichard Blakeway warned in an interview that lead was going “undetected” in housing and should be treated as seriously as the risks posed to humans from asbestos, mould and damp.\n\n“We know it’s a hazard and what [the FT has] highlighted are the flaws in testing, so it would be sensible to do a pilot study to test and sample properties,” Blakeway told the Financial Times. “Lead has the same relevance of all the other hazards and it’s potentially being missed.”\n\nAny survey would need to be instigated and conducted by the UK Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).\n\nThe UK is home to some of the oldest housing in the world and many homes still have lead paint, which creates a poisonous dust that can be harmful if ingested as it flakes and rubs off walls, windows and door frames.\n\nIn 2004, lead was identified as a Class II risk that could result in “severe harm outcomes” by the UK’s housing health and safety rating system, a government assessment method for residential properties.\n\nBefore it was banned in 1992, lead paint in the UK may have contained up to 50 per cent lead by weight, “which is potentially capable of causing lead poisoning in a small child if they eat just a single flake”, according to government guidance published in October.\n\nLead pipes have been banned since the 1970s, but millions of homes are still fitted with the antiquated plumbing, which can contaminate water.\n\nExperts have warned that a lack of routine testing of children and the housing stock means hundreds of thousands of children are probably suffering from the effects of lead poisoning.\n\nBlakeway, who in his role investigates complaints from social housing tenants who rent their homes from local councils and housing associations, said better data was required to understand the scale of the problem in England.\n\n“When we’ve looked at landlords’ policies and processes, hazards can be absent. Too often checks are only carried out after a health issue is reported,” he said.\n\n“Certainly the experience we had with damp and mould is that there was a low awareness, or it wasn’t being taken seriously enough, so we were seeing few cases,” added Blakeway, head of the Housing Ombudsman Service, a public body sponsored by MHCLG, since 2019. “That’s changed because awareness has changed.”\n\nIn the US, the national American Housing Survey collects data on the state of housing and measures levels of hazards including lead. In 2021, the US government’s Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program marked 30 years of work.\n\nExperts in England have called for the renters reform bill, which is now going through parliament, to be amended to have lead hazards and risk assessments included in home buyers’ surveys.\n\nBlakeway said there had been “a degree of complacency when it comes to responding to hazards and I’m surprised to the extent to which there is a disconnect between what the statute expects and then actual practice.\n\n“I think the intent [of the law] is that lead should be part of a routine home survey but it’s not being done. It’s going undetected,” he added.\n\nThe housing ministry said it was that “clear landlords must ensure sure their homes are free from dangerous health and safety hazards, including dangerously high levels of lead”.\n\nReferring to Awaab’s Law, named after two-year-old Awaab Ishak, who died in 2020 after prolonged exposure to mould in his social home, the ministry added: “Through Awaab’s Law we’re taking action to improve standards and end the scandal of unsafe homes, forcing landlords to address hazards in homes within fixed time periods or face legal action from tenants.”",

    "blurb": "Reform UK and Tories could compromise voter support by looking cosy with US president  ",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Good morning. This isn’t a US politics newsletter — sign up to the excellent White House Watch for all of that — but British politics will, inevitably, be hugely shaped by Donald Trump’s second term as president. That poses political risks and opportunities to the UK’s main parties — as discussed below.\n\nThe big risk to the Labour government from a Trump presidency is simple: that his actions have negative consequences for the British economy and/or the government’s finances. We saw how that could play out in the UK gilts market last week, but it could also mean that the government ends up having to spend far more on defence. That could all unfold in ways that make the government unpopular.\n\nThe government’s official line is that the US-UK relationship is strong and it will all be fine, but, of course, that’s because there is no other tenable “official” line. The British government finds itself in an odd position, where Trump’s remarks about Canada and Greenland are, for all the reasons Gideon Rachman set out in a brilliant column, highly alarming.\n\nBut thus far London is not in a direct confrontation with Trump. Some of the things he has said since the election, not least his willingness to ride to the rescue of TikTok, may mean that some possible flashpoints, like the UK government’s relatively meagre list of tariffs on China compared with its peers, are not as big a problem as thought.\n\nThe risk to the Conservatives and the Reform UK party is different and more complex. For Reform, it is that it is seen as close to the US president, and that it is pretty much maxed out when it comes to attracting “British voters who like Donald Trump”. The perception of proximity to Trump may be a help to Nigel Farage when it comes to raising money but hurt when it comes to winning people over. For Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives, on top of that, it all deepens the perception that her party is just a weak echo of Farage’s Reform rather than having a distinctive pitch of its own.\n\nFor the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru the politics of this are rather easy: it’s a way that they can criticise Labour for being insufficiently principled. I have a feeling that it is trickier for the Liberal Democrats: I think some of the voters they won from the Conservatives last time and some 2024 Tory voters who might be up for grabs care a bit about the Lib Dems looking “credible”, ie having a foreign policy position that might actually be deliverable. That’s the balance Ed Davey is trying to tread with positions such as his call for the UK to re-enter the customs union. It’s difficult, but nowhere near as difficult as the one that Keir Starmer faces from now on.\n\nJoin my FT colleagues on Thursday at 1pm GMT for a free webinar on Trump’s second term. Register here and put questions to the panel. And in case you missed it, read the latest special edition of FirstFT Americas, where reporters answered some of our newsletter subscribers’ questions on specific policy areas.\n\nI saw A Complete Unknown on Friday — what I will say is that I think Timothée Chalamet is very good as Bob Dylan, Edward Norton masterful as Pete Seeger and if you go expecting to see a beautifully shot movie with some terrific Dylan songs you’ll have a great time. But if you’re a Dylanologist you’ll find it frustratingly shallow and even more so if you are also interested in Joan Baez or any of the substantial divides between these two musicians. The best way to put it is that in the cinema I loved it, on the train home I found it disappointing, but by Saturday morning I was making plans to see it again. Danny Leigh’s review is here.",

    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter’s guide to London\n\nA basil-topped margherita is deposited on our table. But before we can tuck in, the six of us seated together for dinner have an icebreaker to complete. After all, we’re here to mingle as much as we are to eat.\n\n“I think he’s got a baby face under that beard,” muses my fellow diner Jethro, who is sitting next to me at Dinner for One Hundred (known as D4100), a supper club by the eponymous London pizzeria chain. “Let’s say 22,” a young TV producer opposite me replies as we try to determine who is the youngest staff member at the bar — the first set activity of the evening. The prospect of winning a free bottle of wine offers an instant incentive to bond and, at this dinner for singles, for once no one is reaching for their phones.\n\nThis event is part of a new wave of Gen Z-focused supper clubs popping up across London, as twentysomethings increasingly turn away from sticky dancefloors, bars and dating apps in favour of informal yet carefully curated gatherings hosted by their peers. A Gen Z spin on excellent food at fair prices blends the right ingredients of a dinner party with the spontaneity and excitement of forging connections on a night out.\n\nSupper clubs are a well-established and often affordable form of social dining, usually in the form of a themed ticketed dinner where participants find themselves surrounded by strangers and feast on specially designed menus. They are believed to date back to 1930s California, where Lawrence Frank, the restaurateur behind the legendary steakhouse chain Lawry’s Prime Rib, opened the first supper club in Beverly Hills to ring in the end of Prohibition. This cabaret-style dining boomed in popularity and glamour in the US until the 1960s, and only truly emerged across the Atlantic this century in the form of pop-ups at intimate or lesser-known venues and exclusive one-night dos with top chefs.\n\nNow, as twentysomethings — often dubbed the “stay-at-home” generation — ditch clubbing (around three nightclubs have closed each week in the UK since the start of 2024) and are increasingly health-conscious, supper clubs are becoming popular again, particularly with graduates of Covid-era university cohorts, who seek alternative ways to socialise away from partying.\n\nSome of London’s most appealing Gen Z supper clubs rely on social media to connect with like-minded young diners looking to switch up their socialising habits. Online followers of supper-club communities or the emerging chefs involved in them will quickly snap up tickets in advance; some, such as D4100, sell out so rapidly that the organisers recommend setting reminders when tickets are due to be released.\n\nUsually communal-dining experiences, supper clubs are ideal for those hoping to broaden their social horizons. The concept struck me — a recent graduate newly moved to London — as a great way to meet new people with shared interests. The clubs I have tried, run by and designed for Gen Z, may be a fruitful starting point for anyone willing to step outside their comfort zone and form new and tangible connections.\n\nOne of the newest supper clubs and already among the most popular is The Candid Club. These stylish dinner parties are organised by two longtime friends: actor Jack Redmayne, 23, and online chef-influencer Kit Paterson, formerly of Manteca, 25. Each event pairs dinner with a fashion show, showcasing Paterson’s cooking and new styles from Instagram-trending designers worn by a select number of models among the servers and guests.\n\nFashion and food are at the heart of their events. Paterson, who’s known by his 77,000-plus TikTok followers for cooking up a feast, says the supper clubs are more than an opportunity to create the evening’s cuisine: “For [Candid Club diners] to actually eat the food they see online [on his account], and to see the clothes from designers that they scroll past online, I think that’s a pretty great experience.”\n\nAt this, the third instalment of The Candid Club, my fellow diners and I are welcomed to legendary rock-star haunt the Columbia Hotel, which has hosted artists and bands on the road from Iggy Pop and Amy Winehouse to Stereophonics and Oasis. “This is much more my scene,” says writer, actor and producer Lucy Nicholson, 28, who was drawn to The Candid Club after hosting many dinner parties at home. Swapping host for guest is a refreshing change: “I like to actually speak to people.”\n\nRedmayne, who acts as MC for the evening, makes an announcement before the arrival of the appetisers — dainty plates of whipped ricotta and autumn squash. “After the starters is the fashion show,” says Redmayne, to which the crowd enthusiastically cheers. “So try not to smoke between the starter and the main or you’ll miss out.”\n\nFollowing the first course, a stream of model-servers begin to waft plates of chicken thighs and cannellini beans down the catwalk, a narrow passageway between the two long tables lining the Windsor Suite. It’s a theatrical moment that gives our table some amusement, while being an innovative way to offer live entertainment between courses.\n\nCameras are raised instantly by guests to snap away at the latest designs — and our dishes — sported by the models. In the line-up is the slick tailoring from Soho staple Wax London menswear and young designer Chloe St John’s slow-fashion label Alchemy London, which is taking Instagram by storm with cool-girl chic suits.\n\nThis year the Candid Club has planned a large-scale dinner for each season of the fashion calendar. Its next event promises to be another hit, solidifying its place as the go-to soirée for cuisine à la mode and high spirits.\n\nHosting dinners, workshops and talks, 2sday Supper Club is a bi-monthly community event typically at east London’s coolest cafés and lounges. It prides itself on being a space for young women to create and collaborate. Each event, whether a supper club, open-decks night or pop-up exhibition, provides a platform for informal networking. According to American co-founders Hannah Reznik, 22, fashion marketing student and model scout, and Sofia Wimberly, 21, who works in marketing and social media consulting, half of the diners at each event are new to 2sday. Their gatherings of around 30 to 50 young women aim to appeal to solo diners, as well as creatives looking to make connections.\n\nThe 2sday creators didn’t intend it to be female-focused, but they found it was a natural incentive for their events. “It was just easier to connect on a one-on-one basis with other women” says Wimberly. “We want to make this a space for women in these communities.”\n\nThe duo behind the club met about 18 months ago as neighbours in London, quickly bonding over the communal gatherings of family and friends from their US hometowns.\n\nOn my visit, Bread and Butter Lounge, nestled in a Shoreditch side street, is the temporary home for a Day of the Dead-themed 2sday event. The narrow dining area is decked out in cobwebs and garlands, and each spot is soon filled as young women arrive through the doorway.\n\nEach supper club highlights up-and-coming young female chefs, and when I attend the kitchen is powered by 25-year-old Hannah Herrmann of Manteca, Crispin chef Ella Williams, 23, and sous-chef Lola Pond-Jones, 22.\n\n“London can be a lonely place — you have to figure out how to build a life here,” says social media manager Devyn Molina, 29, a can of Sagrado Blanco in hand. Originally from California, Devyn has been a regular at 2sday since finding it last summer on Instagram. Our table is quickly drawn into discussion over our experiences of socialising in London. The consensus is that with remote working and the onslaught of social media platforms prioritising online relationships, it’s hard for Gen Z to branch out and form new friendships organically — and in person.\n\nThe starters are whisked along the tables by Reznik, Wimberly and the kitchen team — tortilla chips with an assortment of salsas (the most popular being a sweet-and-sour burnt pineapple), crispy plantain bites garnished with fennel leaves and salted, smoky Padrón peppers topped with wedges of lime.\n\nMy table-neighbour Molina and I share a creamy horchata ice cream for dessert, which has a hint of sweetness from dried rose petals and a candied pecan garnish. Splitting it fittingly encapsulates the communal spirit the co-founders sought to create with 2sday.\n\nD4100 began in 2020 as multigenerational dinner in a Hackney warehouse, with 20 per cent of tickets reserved for free for elderly neighbours. It was an attempt to combat loneliness in all age groups, and with 100 invitees the dinner became the club’s namesake. Then Covid-19 hit. D4100 was reborn as a pizzeria every Friday in co-founder Jacob Stuttard’s mum’s front garden, using a portable oven. It grew into three pizzerias including Bar D4100 in Nunhead, south London, which started hosting a regular series of dinners and bar events.\n\nStuttard, 29, and co-founder Jake Bucknall, 28, quickly saw a pattern in peers pairing off at the end of the night. Disillusioned with dating apps and attuned to the continued repercussions of their generation’s isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic, from February 2023 onwards they tapped into dating events. The hosts have since brought together singles across themed evenings at Bar D4100 or at one-off locations such as the Hoxton Hotel.\n\nThe singles supper club is now its most popular events concept. Those aimed at 20-to-30-year-olds have the biggest take-up, with their 30-40s dinners a “close second” and an emerging crowd of 40-50s diners. “In that [20–30s] age range,” explains Bucknall, “there’s never really been anything other than dating apps.”\n\nI attend an event in their Nunhead restaurant. As I enter the small bar-pizzeria, Bucknall greets me and my guest (bringing a single male friend was a requirement to even out numbers) and points us towards our seats. In musical-chairs fashion, these are assigned differently for each course of pizza, with the 50 or so diners herded outside during the reshuffle in a form of culinary speed dating.\n\nMixing people up is key to sparking chemistry, and the low-lit tables of four to eight offer multiple chances to strike up a conversation. For most people here, it’s their first foray into D4100 or indeed any singles event.\n\n“We’re there to matchmake,” says Stuttard. “So it’s all about rhythm, pace and energy.” Stuttard juggles and Bucknall acts as a general-knowledge quiz master, keeping the atmosphere light while dishing out frequent generous rounds of pizza (such as the bestselling The MacGyver: hot honey, whipped feta, Spanish chorizo and crushed fennel seed) fresh from an enormous pink-dome oven.\n\nDespite the success of D4100, the duo recognise the heteronormative limitations of a male-female dinner-party model. They’re now working with queer-event organisers to make D4100 more inclusive.\n\nD4100 is a testament to modern dating, where the swarm of apps and situationships make long-term romance less of a guarantee. “In the early days we used to say that if you come to a Dinner for One Hundred event, you might meet the love of your life,” says Jacob. But anything can happen: “We don’t say that any more. We now say everything’s possible.”\n\nHave you tried one of London’s Gen Z supper clubs? Tell us about it in the comments below.

    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "A British court has given property group JLL permission to keep managing 33 luxury London apartments owned by the ex-wife of China Evergrande’s co-founder, after her assets were frozen in the wake of the Chinese developer’s collapse.\n\nThe US-listed group runs letting and management services for the flats near the river Thames on behalf of Ding Yumei, the former wife of property tycoon Hui Ka Yan, once China’s richest man but now being held on suspicion of involvement in “illegal crimes”. Ding herself lives in one of the luxury apartments, court filings say.\n\nJudges in London and Hong Kong last year granted injunctions that froze Ding’s assets worldwide, after liquidators were appointed to recoup funds for Evergrande investors. JLL told a London court it was no longer willing to manage the properties unless it was made clear that it had permission to, filings show, a case it has now won.\n\nThe lawsuit provides a rare window into the normally discreet dealings between property groups such as JLL and wealthy overseas clients looking to stash their funds in centres such as London. JLL employs more than 100,000 people worldwide in businesses ranging from facilities management to advising on multibillion-dollar commercial real estate deals.\n\nCourt filings by Evergrande’s liquidators say Ding is “amongst the principal beneficiaries” of “what is understood to be the largest financial fraud to have emerged from mainland China”.\n\nJLL and Ding declined to comment.\n\nThe liquidators, Alvarez & Marsal restructuring specialists Eddie Middleton and Tiffany Wong, were appointed a year ago when a Hong Kong judge ordered the winding-up of Evergrande’s holding company, listed in the territory.\n\nThey are racing to lay claim to and sell off assets around the world that may enable them to hand money back to creditors. The company had more than $20bn of offshore debt in issue when it defaulted in 2021.\n\nDing owns the apartments, on Carnation Way in Nine Elms, south of the river Thames, through five companies registered in the British Virgin Islands, according to court filings. JLL provides letting and property management services such as marketing the flats, setting up lease agreements and receiving rent, the filings say.\n\nThe Financial Times has identified seven of the properties, which cost £15.6mn.\n\nA court order issued last month says JLL can handle payments in relation to “meeting the costs of insurance and repairs, replacement and/or repair of fixtures and fittings only where necessary and on a ‘like-for-like’ basis, the payment of ground rent and service charges, and payments for utilities”, among other things.\n\nDing had opposed the court making that order, saying it was unnecessary and prejudiced her position in Hong Kong court proceedings. Evergrande’s liquidators backed JLL’s case, saying: “All parties to the proceedings agree that JLL should continue to provide its services . . . to preserve the value of those properties and ensure that they can continue to generate revenue.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Chan Ho-him and Chris Cook",

    "event_name": "Britain’s situation remains fragile",
    "blurb": "The government must retain the confidence of its creditors",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "On January 13 2025, spreads between yields on 10-year gilts and German Bunds reached 230 basis points. This was four basis points higher than the peak reached on September 27 2022, when Liz Truss was prime minister. The UK is probably not heading for a borrowing crisis. But its position is fragile. The government must reinforce confidence in the soundness of the UK and its own good sense.\n\nInterest rates have risen across the G7. Even in Germany, the yield on the ultra-long 30-year Bund rose by 290 basis points between January 15 2021 and January 15 2025. In the US, the rise was 300 basis points, and in France 350 points. Alas, the rise in UK yields was the highest in the G7, at 440 basis points. UK yields on 30-year gilts reached 5.2 per cent in mid-January. This was the highest level in the G7, while German yields were only 2.8 per cent and French ones still only 3.9 per cent. But US yields were not so far behind UK levels, at 4.9 per cent, probably because of the huge structural fiscal deficits in the global economic superpower.\n\nIn sum, UK yields on long-term debt have risen by more and reached higher levels than in peer countries. Yields on 30-year gilts were even 56 basis points higher than Italy’s on January 15. Moreover, while UK yields had risen 78 basis points in the previous year, Italy’s did not rise at all. That is embarrassing.\n\nA crucial question is why rates have risen. The big change has been in the real rate of interest, not inflation expectations. In the UK case, we have reasonably robust measures of both, from yields on index-linked and conventional gilts. The difference between the two indicates inflation expectations and perceptions of inflation risk.\n\nThese data show that real interest rates in the UK have jumped from a trough of -3.4 in early December 2021 to a peak of 1.3 per cent on January 14 2025. One might describe this as normalisation after a period of ultra-depressed real rates. The jump in real interest rates largely matches the rise in the yield on conventional gilts, which suggests that changes in inflation expectations have been surprisingly small.\n\nSo, what do these real and nominal yields tell one about the stability of UK public debt? If the ratio of debt to GDP is to be stabilised when the real rate of interest exceeds the growth rate of the economy, the government needs to run a primary fiscal surplus (balance between revenue and spending before interest payments). A real rate of 1.3 per cent allows a modest primary deficit if growth is consistently higher than that. IMF data show that this was precisely the trend rate of growth of the UK between 2007 and 2024. So, debt stability requires consistent primary balances. Happily, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s analysis of the October Budget, the primary budget is forecast to move into a surplus of a little under 1 per cent of GDP in the last three years of this decade. This would be consistent with rough stability of the ratio of net debt to GDP, as the OBR shows in its debt forecasts.\n\nThe implication is that the situation is manageable. Yet there are risks. One is that global real and nominal interest rates could shoot up further, perhaps because of further jumps in spending on investment or defence, or increased awareness of a host of political, monetary and financial risks. A UK-specific fragility is that the country runs persistent capital account surpluses, which make it highly dependent on foreign funding, unlike, say, Japan. This is also true for the US. But the latter is the prime borrower for the rest of the world.\n\nAnother risk for the UK is that GDP growth, already low, might slow even further. The politics of running primary fiscal surpluses might then become impossible. Yet another risk is that the ratio of net debt to GDP is already close to 100 per cent. This is hardly low. Comfortingly, it is below the levels in Japan, Italy, France and the US. But it is far higher than it was two decades ago. Finally, there is “Trump risk”, particularly threats of high tariffs against an open economy no longer inside the EU.\n\nIn brief, the UK’s situation is fragile. The government needs to retain the confidence of its creditors. It is crucial not to adopt policies that raise doubts about its good sense. How taxes were raised in the Budget did just that. So, too, do regulatory developments, notably in the labour market. The government will have to toughen its stance on current spending in its coming review or consider higher taxes.\n\nThe UK must focus on resilience and growth. Panic is unnecessary, but the era of cheap borrowing is over. Policy has to respond.\n\nmartin.wolf@ft.com\n\nFollow Martin Wolf with myFT and on Twitter",

    "event_name": "UK’s labour market tsar calls for crackdown on bogus self-employment",
    "blurb": "‘More urgency’ needed on workers’ rights and resourcing of new fair work agency, says Margaret Beels",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government needs to act to stop sham self-employment if it wants its flagship overhaul of workers’ rights to succeed, warned the official charged with tackling labour exploitation.\n\nMargaret Beels, the independent director of labour market enforcement, told the Financial Times in an interview that employers could simply sidestep new obligations to their staff if ministers continued to delay legislation to clarify workers’ status.\n\n“I would like to see a bit more urgency . . . You can consult until the cows come home, but sometimes government just needs to take decisions,” said Beels, echoing concerns raised by unions and business groups about the omission of a critical set of measures from the employment rights bill.\n\nThe bill, introduced to parliament last year, encompasses a sweeping set of reforms to give UK workers more security. But it does not tackle an issue Labour had previously promised to address: the potential for employers to exploit the ambiguities in UK law over workers’ status.\n\nInstead, the government said it would need to consult at length on how to create a simpler framework, with a single status of worker and a clear distinction between the employed and self-employed.\n\nBeels said there was a risk that leaving this issue until later would allow employers to shirk their new responsibilities by hiring gig workers.\n\nThe UK is unusual in having three types of employment status: employees, self-employment and an in-between category of “limb (b)” workers, and it is often difficult to establish how people should be treated.\n\nWorkers in the third group have more protection than the self-employed but lack some important employee rights that the Labour government plans to strengthen through the ERB, such as statutory sick pay, redundancy rights and protection against unfair dismissal.\n\nCrucially, they are treated as self-employed for tax purposes, creating a big incentive for businesses to use contractors in place of employees, especially after the £25bn Budget increase in employers’ national insurance.\n\nBut a rise in bogus self-employment is just one of the risks Beels sees looming, as the government enshrines new rights in law without yet specifying how much money will be made available to enforce them.\n\nThe complexity of UK hiring practices, where workers could be recruited by one agency, employed by another and told what to do by someone else, made it hard for individuals to enforce their rights, Beels said.\n\nBut the UK’s thinly resourced enforcement agencies struggle to enforce existing labour market rules. The three main bodies — HM Revenue & Customs’ minimum wage enforcement team, the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, and the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate — are set to be merged into a new Fair Work Agency, with a wider remit.\n\nBeels’ role was created by the previous Conservative government to improve co-ordination between the agencies, set their strategy and prepare for this merger.\n\nIt proved a frustrating task, she acknowledged, as ministers repeatedly failed to follow through on the commitment to create a single body.\n\n“I described myself as a sort of John the Baptist figure, saying prepare the way, this great thing is coming . . . and it never came,” said Beels, a former chair of the GLAA and former director of Scottish Gas.\n\nThe Fair Work Agency is now taking shape under Labour, and Beels, whose own office will be disbanded when the agency is created, is intent on making it a success.\n\nBoosting its profile will be crucial. “Transparency is really important . . . workers knowing what the agency is doing and how effective it is,” she said.\n\nEven without new funding, the creation of a single enforcement body would make it possible to allocate resources more effectively, she insisted.\n\nFunding for all three agencies totalled little more than £40mn in 2023-24 — of which £31.2mn was for HMRC’s minimum wage team. Resourcing for the FWA will be determined in this summer’s tight spending review.\n\nExisting constraints meant the GLAA and EAS had not had the capacity to “lift the stones” and investigate the extent of exploitation in the construction sector, flagged as high risk, she said, hinting that resources would come under new strain as the agency’s remit expanded.\n\nBeels gave this message in clear terms earlier this month to a cross-party committee of MPs, saying: “If anyone thinks that we will raise standards simply by throwing three budgets together . . . that is not the case.\n\n“There needs to be a step change in addressing the resources available to the fair work agency,” she added.",

    "blurb": "EY and PwC will struggle to meet UK goals while KPMG and Deloitte are likely to fall short on global ambition ",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "EY and PwC are on track to miss 2025 targets for female partner representation in the UK as the Big Four accounting firms struggle to sufficiently boost the proportion of women in their upper ranks.\n\nEY’s UK arm is set to fall short of its aim most dramatically, having set the most ambitious goal. The firm is targeting a 40 per cent female equity partnership by this year, with data from last year showing that only 28 per cent of partners in the country were women.\n\nAudit firms have stepped up the number of women in top jobs in recent years, with EY recently naming Janet Truncale as its new global chair and appointing Anna Anthony as the UK firm’s new managing partner.\n\nBut raising the gender balance of partnerships towards parity has proved to be a slow process, a phenomenon echoed in sectors such as law and banking.\n\nThe Big Four have all set goals in recent years to increase their proportions of female partners and, in turn, help to reduce their gender pay gaps, with women tending to account for less than a fifth of that rank in the UK towards the end of the 2010s.\n\nPwC is 3 percentage points shy of its 2025 goal of a 30 per cent UK female partnership according to its most recent data. The figure has increased by 1 to 2 percentage points per year since 2021, meaning it would require a bigger leap forward to close the gap before PwC reports its new figures later this year.\n\nKPMG and Deloitte have already met their own targets in the UK. The former was the first of the Big Four to publish gender diversity data just over a decade ago, and surpassed an interim 25 per cent goal in 2022. It had a 29 per cent female partnership in the UK in 2023.\n\nAnd Deloitte reported last year that 30 per cent of its partners were women, ahead of its 2025 deadline to hit that figure.\n\nHowever both firms are on track to miss global partnership targets — goals that PwC and EY do not have.\n\nThe Big Four have argued that boosting the number of female partners takes time, owing to the need to build a pipeline of candidates with sufficient experience to be promoted.\n\nKarl Edge, chief people officer at KPMG UK, said the firm was “committed to creating an inclusive environment”, adding: “While progress may fluctuate, we’re focused on reaching better representation across all levels of our firm, challenging ourselves to go further and faster.”\n\nKPMG International said it would “continue to build on the momentum” for gender equality, which remains “a strategic priority”.\n\nJackie Henry, managing partner for people and purpose at Deloitte UK, said the firm was “proud” of meeting its 2025 target a year early. “But . . . we will continue to hold ourselves accountable and to strive for greater gender equality.”\n\nEY and PwC declined to comment.\n\n​Letter in response to this article:\n\nGender parity should be a business reality not just an aspiration / From Professor Geeta Nargund, Chair, The Pipeline, London W1, UK",

    "body": "An influential select committee of MPs has questioned whether the UK government’s new Office for Value for Money represents good value for money for taxpayers, calling it a “red herring”.\n\nThe cost-saving unit was set up by chancellor Rachel Reeves to ensure sensible spending decisions. But the Treasury select committee said on Monday that it lacked resources, had a short lifespan and ran a high risk of duplication.\n\nMeg Hillier, committee chair, said its report had concluded the body was “an understaffed, poorly-defined organisation which has been set up with a vague remit and no clear plan to measure its effectiveness”.\n\n“All of which leads me to feel this initiative may be something of a red herring,” she added, calling for greater transparency about how the office would assess its effectiveness and deliver on its remit.\n\nThe committee said it was sceptical over how the body would have “meaningful impact” since it only had 12 full-time members as of December and its chair, David Goldstone, only had a year-long contract.\n\nIt demanded to know how much the body would cost, including the use of external consultants, and how it would scrutinise departments’ investment proposals.\n\nThe Treasury said it was putting an end to taxpayer money being “squandered”.\n\n“This office’s role is additional to existing parts of government and will draw on a range of expertise across disciplines to help route out waste, including a focus on where department spending may be overlapping,” it said.\n\n“They also sit alongside our wider spending review which is, for the first time in 17 years, reviewing every line of government spending,” it added. The department did not say what the new unit would cost.\n\nThe unit’s small team of staff includes secondees from existing government agencies, such as the National Audit Office, the Government Commercial Function and the Evaluation Task Force in the Cabinet Office.\n\nThe report highlighted seven examples of organisations, teams and processes that had already been established to improve efficiency in public spending decisions.\n\n“Those organisations are only a selection from the bodies working on value for money across Whitehall, which shows there is a clear risk of unnecessary duplication,” it said.\n\nThe NAO alone has an annual budget of £106mn and more than 960 staff, the report noted.\n\nIn July, Reeves announced plans for the new body and in her October Budget she said it would have a remit to “provide targeted interventions” through the spending review, to “root out waste and inefficiency”.\n\nThe government is under pressure to demonstrate greater control over public spending after days of rising gilt yields which have threatened to remove the chancellor’s “fiscal headroom” which could mean more cuts.\n\nGoldstone told the committee he would be involved with “most if not all’ departments on their efficiency plans ahead of the spending review.\n\nThe unit’s stated remit includes scrutinising investment proposals to guarantee they offer value for money. But Johanna Harston, a director at the OVfM, admitted that the unit would only look at “more than two or three” investment proposals.",

    "blurb": "Lords economic affairs committee calls for urgent action to prevent spiralling costs",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "A surge in UK health-related benefit claimants has been caused by design flaws in the welfare system, not by worsening health outcomes or long waits for treatment, a committee of peers has said.\n\nThe House of Lords economic affairs committee called on ministers to act urgently to prevent the annual cost of incapacity and disability benefits spiralling from its current level of £64.7bn to a projected £100.7bn by 2029-30.\n\nIts findings challenge the government’s assumptions ahead of a promised review of the welfare system, while highlighting the strain the rising benefits bill is placing on other spending on public services.\n\nIn a letter to the work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall, published on Monday, the committee said there was “no convincing evidence” that the rising benefits bill was owing to deteriorating health or NHS waiting lists.\n\n“People without work have incentives to claim health-related benefits; and once in receipt of them, have neither the incentive nor support to find and accept a job,” it warned.\n\nLord George Bridges, committee chair, said: “This is an enormous and growing social problem. The [government’s] timetable doesn’t display the urgency required.”\n\nHe added that while ministers had promised to publish plans for welfare reform in the spring, this would be too late for any savings to be factored into this year’s spending review.\n\nThe committee’s diagnosis of the problem is different from the narrative Kendall gave when she set out reforms to support for jobseekers in the autumn, billed as a plan to “Get Britain Working”.\n\nShe described a post-pandemic health crisis that had made Britain the only country in the G7 to see its workforce shrink, with 2.8mn people counted as economically inactive for health-related reasons.\n\nThe peers said problems with the official labour market data had clouded the picture, and that it was not clear whether overall labour market inactivity was any higher now than in 2019.\n\nThere has, however, been an increase of 1.2mn working-age people receiving health-related benefits since early 2020, which now totals 3.7mn.\n\nThe committee said this reflected strong incentives for people to claim incapacity support in preference to jobless benefits because of a “stark financial disparity” in the help on offer.\n\nPeople assessed as unfit to work or to look for work could double their income and escape tough conditionality by moving from jobseekers’ allowance to incapacity benefit, the committee said. They then risked big income losses if they went back to a job that did not work out, it added.\n\nNew claims for incapacity benefit have not risen enough to explain the rise in the number of recipients. This is mostly due to the fact that a higher share of claims are approved and fewer people withdraw or leave the system after a reassessment.\n\nThe committee said the process for assessing claims needed to be more rigorous, but the government also needed to give people more support to return to work, and ensure they did not lose by accepting a job.\n\nIt would need to reform both unemployment and incapacity benefits, because of the interaction between the two, Bridges said, potentially easing the jobless benefits criteria while tightening sickness benefits.\n\nSome of the committee’s recommendations are similar to proposals by the previous work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, which have not been implemented, partly because of a legal challenge to the consultation process.\n\nA government spokesperson said it was “determined to get Britain working again”, had set out first steps to boost employment already and would consult on reforms to health and disability benefits in the spring.\n\n“We have been clear that the current welfare system needs reform, so it is fairer on the taxpayer and people get the support they need,” they added.",

    "body": "Labour will have to focus heavily on developing service exports to deliver faster economic growth, according to an analysis that warns that the UK’s Northern regions continue to lag far behind the more prosperous South East.\n\nThe potential for increasing productivity and wages is heavily skewed towards the South East, driven by exporting activity in high-value services such as IT and finance, the Centre for Cities think-tank said on Monday.\n\n“If we build more in London and the Greater South East we know that will have a positive growth effect, even though politics makes that difficult,” said Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities.\n\nHe added that making it easier to build in existing prosperous areas was one of the fastest routes to growth.\n\nLabour has pledged to invest in all regions as part of its forthcoming industrial strategy, alongside plans to expand English devolution and empower local mayors.\n\nThe government’s industrial strategy green paper describes narrowing the gap between the South East and other regions as “key” to raising growth overall, with advanced manufacturing identified as a target sector.\n\nHowever, Tony Travers, professor in the government department at the London School of Economics, said Labour would need to make hard choices if it wanted to deliver rapid improvements to GDP.\n\n“The government has sold itself on kick-starting growth, but this analysis underlines just how dependent they are on London and the South East to achieve that goal. The reality is they have to decide to live with it, or try to change it and risk ending up with less growth,” he said.\n\nThe report highlighted the abiding economic north-south divide, with eight of the 10 cities with the highest average wages found in the Greater South East despite the pledges of successive governments to reduce inequality.\n\nSince 1997, despite initiatives to narrow the UK’s regional economic disparities such as the Northern Powerhouse and Levelling Up, “there has been no change based on wages”, the report said.\n\nThe average worker in London now earns £20,000 a year more than their counterpart in Burnley, the city with the lowest pay, it found.\n\nCities needed to create conditions to “attract more cutting-edge companies if they are to be more prosperous”, regardless of which sectors the companies operated in, the report concluded.\n\nCarter said the findings highlighted the need to boost planning reforms and focus on industrial strategy in areas of the economy with the highest growth potential.\n\nA ranking of cities by the number of “new economy” businesses per head of population, operating in areas such as AI, advanced materials, fintech or life sciences, skewed heavily towards London and the South East.\n\nThe top seven places were all located in the South East, while seven of the bottom 10 cities were in the north of England.\n\nThe think-tank also said the role of manufacturing should not be “over emphasised” in any drive to raise wages outside of the South East, adding the sector was set to play an “ever smaller” role in the economy overall.\n\n“It is unlikely that a place will see a sustained improvement in the performance of its export base that is not led by high-value service activities,” it added.\n\nThe report also cautioned against over-dependence on one sector, lest it decline, pointing to Aberdeen’s reliance on oil and gas exports, noting that where places have dominant industries they should seek to diversify their economies.\n\nThe Treasury said it remained committed to regional growth, based on devolution, investment and regulatory reform.\n\n“Growth is the number one mission of this government’s ‘plan for change’ and ensuring growth is felt in all regions of the UK is a core part of that,” a spokesperson added.",

    "blurb": "Darren Jones says Britain should not look at incoming US president ‘as a risk’",
    "date": "2025-01-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "A senior Treasury minister has predicted that Donald Trump will not impose heavy tariffs on the UK, as Labour insists it can do business with the incoming US administration.\n\nWhen asked if the UK had a plan to deal with potential trade tariffs from the incoming Trump government, Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “I don’t think we’re going to be in that scenario.”\n\n“We shouldn’t be looking at president-elect Trump’s inauguration as a risk, or a bad thing for the UK. It could be an enormously positive thing with lots of opportunities,” he told Sky News on Sunday.\n\nSir Keir Starmer’s centre-left administration in London is seeking a functional working relationship with the new government in Washington.\n\nTrump swept back into the White House promising to apply steep tariffs to imports to the US from its trading partners, including blanket 20 per cent tariffs on all goods.\n\nMembers of Starmer’s cabinet have in the past called Trump “inflammatory and ignorant”, “an absolute moron”, “a profound threat”, “the worst president in history” and “a racist, misogynistic, self-confessed groper”.\n\nStarmer’s party angered Trump’s inner circle when about 100 Labour officials went out to the US to campaign for the Democrats last year.\n\nThe prime minister has since gone out of his way to strike a pragmatic note, telling the Financial Times on Friday that he had a “constructive” relationship with the new president.\n\nOn Sunday night, Starmer offered his “warmest congratulations” to Trump in a statement released by Downing Street.\n\n“For centuries, the relationship between our two nations has been one of collaboration, co-operation and enduring partnership. It is a uniquely close bond,” the prime minister said. “With President Trump’s long-standing affection and historical ties to the UK, I know that depth of friendship will continue.”\n\nSadiq Khan, Labour mayor of London, threatened to disrupt those conciliatory efforts on Sunday when he warned of “resurgent fascism” on the eve of the incoming US president’s inauguration.\n\nKhan wrote on Sunday in the Observer newspaper that the west was in a “perilous moment” with the rise of the “far right” in many countries.\n\n“European nations are coming under the influence of extreme nativist parties that are hostile to democratic institutions, immigrant populations and fact-based journalism,” he wrote.\n\n“In Germany, the AfD is on course for a breakthrough in next month’s federal elections. In France, the National Rally is topping presidential polls. And, of course, in the US, Donald Trump is back.”\n\nThe last time Trump was in the White House there was public enmity between him and Khan, whom he dubbed a “stone-cold loser” for criticising his presidency.\n\nPriti Patel, shadow foreign secretary, told Sky News: “It’s really not for politicians in other countries to start making disrespectful and disparaging comments about president-elect Trump.”\n\nPatel is expected to attend Trump’s inauguration, along with fellow Conservatives including former prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.\n\nAhead of Trump’s inauguration on Monday, the Tories are vying for his ear along with Reform UK, which has set out more rightwing policies on issues such as net zero and immigration and whose leader Nigel Farage is close to the new president.\n\nBy contrast only one Labour politician has been invited to the event: Lord Maurice Glasman, an academic who said at the weekend there was a “real genuine working class enthusiasm” for Trump.\n\nJones said he doubted that Trump would block the appointment of Lord Peter Mandelson, former business secretary, as UK ambassador to the US against a backdrop of speculation that he could challenge the appointment.\n\n“I mean . . . I think someone said something at Mar-a-Lago and it’s probably being propagated by some politicians that would like to cause a bit of a nuisance,” he said.\n\nOne Labour official said there had been “no sign or indication from Trump himself that this is at all likely”.",

    "blurb": "Tax breaks for corporate sponsors can benefit the creative sector at a time of dwindling public funds",
    "date": "2025-01-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "The author is a director of the European Sponsorship Association, a UK council member of Creative UK, and a consultant in the cultural sector\n\nThe UK government’s announcement last week of £60mn to support the creative industries is very welcome, but what if there was another untapped source of money to drive economic growth? The UK’s creative industries are vital to the economy. Valued at £124bn, they are worth more than the life sciences, aerospace and automotive industries combined. Arts and culture alone contribute an impressive £34.6bn.\n\nBeyond the economic value, the subsidised arts sector nurtures creative and technical talent and creates new intellectual property. Award-winning creators like Sam Mendes, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Stephen Daldry honed their craft in the subsidised sector before generating billions through global franchises like James Bond and The Crown.\n\nYet this critical element of our creative ecosystem is in crisis. According to a 2024 report by the University of Warwick and Campaign for the Arts, the government’s core cultural funding dropped by 18 per cent between 2009 and 2023. Arts Council England funding also decreased by 18 per cent, and local government funding in England fell by 48 per cent. A 2023 analysis of 2,800 arts organisations showed a combined deficit of £117.8mn — the worst financial position in five years.\n\nA renewed funding model is needed — with state investment at its heart. One compelling solution could lie in France’s Aillagon law.\n\nIntroduced in 2003 by then culture minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon, this policy incentivises corporate philanthropy for arts and charities by offering a 60 per cent tax relief on donations, capped at 0.5 per cent of a company’s annual turnover. The law has transformed France’s cultural funding, with the overall volume of declared patronage increasing from €1bn in 2004 to nearly €4bn in 2018.\n\nCorporate philanthropy is now embedded in France’s creative ecosystem. In 2017 the Louvre was generating €12mn annually from the Aillagon law. Versailles raised €10mn and the Centre Pompidou €5mn. Most strikingly, in 2019, France raised €850mn within 72 hours to rebuild Notre-Dame cathedral thanks to corporate generosity nurtured by the Aillagon law.\n\nBy contrast, the UK’s corporate sector remains an untapped resource for arts funding. Over the past decade, FTSE 100 charitable donations fell by 34 per cent. True, there are some visionary, committed sponsors of the arts. But 70 per cent of commercial sponsorship goes to sports, not the arts.\n\nA UK version of the Aillagon law could catalyse private investment in the arts. By offering tax incentives for corporate donors, the government could encourage the business sector to step in where public funding falls short.\n\nCritics of the Aillagon law argue that generous tax breaks shift a lot of the burden of donations on to taxpayers. However, this overlooks the broader benefits. A thriving cultural sector develops new intellectual property and supports jobs, tourism and innovation, while fostering community cohesion and national identity.\n\nThis isn’t just about the money. It’s about stimulating collaboration between culture and commerce — much needed, given current arts sponsorship protests, which risk making sponsors think twice about aligning with the arts.\n\nFrance’s Aillagon law demonstrates how visionary policy can transform cultural funding. It’s more than a fiscal mechanism. It’s a catalyst for cultural vitality and corporate engagement, while reducing reliance on dwindling public funds.\n\nGiven the state of the nation’s finances, the UK government must match its commitment to support the arts with bold action. Adopting a French-style policy could win the Labour government a place in history for securing the future of the UK’s arts sector — and driving economic growth.",

    "blurb": "Government to put forward amendments to employment legislation but remains intent on delivering broad plan ",
    "date": "2025-01-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government is seeking compromises on parts of its landmark workers’ rights legislation as employers redouble calls for changes to some of its more contentious elements to remove obstacles to economic growth.\n\nTwo government figures said ministers were preparing to put forward amendments to the employment rights bill — a sweeping set of reforms designed to give workers more security and boost the role of unions — in response to concerns raised by business over recent weeks.\n\n“There are some things we will never agree on, some business groups didn’t want this legislation in the first place,” one of the people said. “But we are looking for consensus, we are listening to their concerns in the light of the Budget. They are pushing at an open door.”\n\nMinisters remain intent on delivering the reforms set out in their plan to “Make Work Pay”, one of the most ambitious parts of Labour’s election manifesto that has so far gone through parliament without big changes.\n\nBut the government is under pressure to reassure business it can still deliver economic growth, following a sell-off in gilts that has put in question Rachel Reeves’ ability to meet her fiscal rules without more tax rises.\n\nEmployers are increasingly worried about the cost of implementing new rules on top of changes to taxation and the minimum wage announced by the chancellor in the October Budget, after the bill was introduced.\n\n“Business confidence has fallen, economic growth isn’t there. There is a moment to say . . . let’s revisit this,” said Craig Beaumont, executive director at the Federation of Small Businesses.\n\nThe CBI business group has said ministers are nearing a “crunch moment”, where they can bring forward government-backed amendments to alter parts of the bill that could otherwise have unintended consequences for workers.\n\nMinisters are looking at changes to address concerns that some of the measures could place burdens on business that were never intended, without benefiting workers, according to the two government figures.\n\nOne change would be to ensure big employers did not have to consult workers on redundancies at different sites if they were unrelated, so businesses were not “stuck endlessly consulting on small changes”.\n\nOfficials said secondary legislation would address another concern that a new duty to compensate workers for shifts cancelled at short notice might apply when employers were simply checking who might fill a gap in their rota.\n\nBut there is no sign yet that ministers will be receptive to bigger demands to revisit the principles underpinning the bill or rewrite key provisions.\n\nThe CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce and manufacturers’ group Make UK all fear the bill will hand too much power to trade unions, significantly lowering hurdles for winning collective bargaining rights and taking strike action.\n\nThey also say a clampdown on contentious “fire and rehire” practices goes too far, obliging businesses to be on the point of insolvency before they can force through any changes to contracts.\n\nThe business groups want a rethink of new protections for zero-hours contract workers, arguing that employers should be obliged to meet requests for a contract that reflects regular working patterns, but not to offer one to all those potentially eligible.\n\nThe FSB is also challenging one of the bill’s key provisions: the right to protection from day one against unfair dismissal. It maintains that even with provisions allowing for probation periods, employers will not have enough protection against vexatious claims that could take years to come to a tribunal.\n\nChanges to the primary legislation in these four areas would be big concessions that would be strongly opposed by unions.\n\nHowever, the effect of many measures will depend on details of their implementation, which are to be set out later in regulations. Business lobbyists hope to soften the impact of key measures, including the so-called ban on zero-hours contracts.\n\nOne question yet to be settled is how long a “reference period” is needed to establish workers’ entitlement to regular hours when moving from a zero-hours contract.\n\nBusiness groups say the 12-week period suggested is not long enough to allow for seasonal fluctuations. The CBI wants a year’s data to be used where available, while others advocate six months.\n\nGovernment officials are considering ways to keep the headline 12-week figure while allowing employers to factor in peaks and troughs owing to weather or holiday periods.\n\nA bigger sticking point is the government’s resolve to extend the ban on zero-hours contracts to agency workers.\n\nNeil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, said both options consulted on by ministers to achieve this goal were unworkable.\n\n“The government have a goal of 80 per cent employment,” he told a parliamentary committee this week. “I have to tell you right now that is not going that well in the labour market.”\n\nThe Department for Business and Trade said the employment rights bill was “a crucial part” of the government’s “mission to grow the economy”.\n\nThe department added that it had “already engaged extensively with businesses and unions” and “look[ed] forward to more engagement and consultation in the coming months to ensure the bill works for workers and employers alike”.",

    "body": "Data on Friday will offer a snapshot of business activity in Europe ahead of this month’s European Central Bank meeting to set interest rates.\n\nThe January reading for the IHS Markit composite purchasing managers’ index — which combines manufacturing and services activity — will be closely watched, analysts said, as it comes before the inauguration of Donald Trump. The incoming president has promised sweeping tariffs, which may damp sentiment in coming months.\n\nMany of the bloc’s largest economies, including Germany and France, are already battling an economic slowdown. A consensus of analysts expects a reading of 49.7, below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Even so, that would mark a slight improvement on December’s reading of 49.6.\n\nThe data is likely to be an important input for policymakers at the ECB meeting at the end of the month. In December its governing council members became more vocal over the outlook for growth in the bloc, in addition to the uncertainty over the trade policies of the incoming Trump administration. With inflation slowing, the central bank is widely expected to cut rates by 0.25 percentage points from its present rate of 3 per cent.\n\nConsumer demand remains soft and there are growing signs of “cracks” in the labour market, leaving the ECB “increasingly behind the curve with its slow loosening cycle”, according to Tomas Dvorak, an economist at Oxford Economics. Mari Novik\n\nInvestors will be hoping that UK wage data on Tuesday will provide some clues about the path of interest rates following a tumultuous period for the gilt market.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect regular annual earning growth to have accelerated to 5.5 per cent in the three months to November, from 5.2 per cent in the three months to October, which would raise the pressure on policymakers who have concerns about the return of domestic price pressures.\n\nThe Bank of England mentioned wages 15 times in its monetary policy summary last month and is also grappling with impact on earnings of the rise in the National Living Wage, and the increase in employers’ National Contributions from April.\n\nThe labour market numbers will come after data this week showed an unexpected decline in inflation to 2.5 per cent in December and an economy that barely grew in the three months to November. Gilt yields, which rose sharply earlier this month, dropped this week as traders bet that the central bank will cut interest rates more aggressively to kick-start growth.\n\nPhilip Shaw, economist at Investec, also forecast a 5.5 per cent rise for earnings, but said that wage increases were unlikely to derail the BoE from making another rate cut in February, from its current level of 4.75 per cent. “Gradually dialling back policy restraint seems warranted given subpar growth and receding inflation,” he noted.\n\nFurthermore the Bank has also shown signs that it might play down the expected rise in wages in the official data. In December, it acknowledged the pick-up in wage growth but said that official earning growth “had tended to be more volatile than other wage indicators”. Valentina Romei\n\nJanuary has already proved to be a rollercoaster month for US markets, as investors flipped back and forth in their expectations for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year.In a week starting with Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, traders will look at measures of business activity in the world’s biggest economy — searching for clues about the Fed’s likely course of action.\n\nOn Friday the S&P Global will publish its monthly “flash” purchasing managers’ index, which will give traders insights into manufacturing and services activity. In recent months the number has underscored the robustness of the US economy. Last month the “flash” PMI estimates rose to 56.6, a 33-month high, although it was later revised to 55.4. A reading above 50 signals growth.\n\nBut another strong reading in January would probably deepen concerns among traders that the Fed will cool on planned rate cuts.\n\nEarlier this month, better than expected December payrolls figures sent Treasury yields lurching higher, as traders trimmed their bets on the number of rate cuts this year. Days later, weaker-than-anticipated inflation data prompted a rethink — sparking a rally in government debt and stocks, as rate cut bets were cranked up again.“The market is still wary of the incoming administration’s policies especially around tariffs and tax cuts which could help to stoke inflation,” said John Kerschner, head of US securitised products and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, shortly after that consumer price index reading.However, the latest “inflation numbers go a long way to giving the market confidence that Fed policy is on target”, he added. “Perhaps most importantly, the market is relieved that potential nosebleed interest rates are, for now, taken off the table.” Harriet Clarfelt",

    "date": "2025-01-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "More than a third of elite UK universities were forced to make further staff cuts last year, while severance spending across the Russell Group rose by more than a fifth, according to Financial Times analysis.\n\nTen of the 24 universities in the group said they ran voluntary severance schemes in 2024, offering staff compensation packages in exchange for taking voluntary redundancy.\n\nPayouts for staff redundancies rose after a sharp drop-off in lucrative foreign students. Analysis of annual financial statements showed that collectively 22 Russell Group universities paid £70mn last academic year, a 29 per cent rise on the £54mn spent in 2022-23. Two universities did not provide data.\n\nThe findings demonstrate the exposure of top higher education institutions to the sector’s mounting financial pressures.\n\nThe retrenchment among the Russell Group mirrors cost cutting across the sector which has resulted in universities announcing course closures and travel and entertainment bans as well as staff cuts.\n\nRussell Group chief executive Tim Bradshaw said the cutbacks were needed to make institutions financially sustainable but insisted the government should do more to help a sector whose research was integral to the UK’s growth and innovation agenda.\n\n“Alongside the steps universities are taking, we need the government to help secure a sustainable system for funding higher education,” he said.\n\nVivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, the main sector lobby group, said the belt-tightening was a sign of institutions putting their houses in order but posed potential risks.\n\n“The danger is that nobody is looking at the overall consequences of this, and the risk that you develop system-wide problems,” she added.\n\nRepeated cuts had sapped staff morale, union spokespeople added. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, which represents lecturers, noted that “year-on-year cycles of restructures and redundancies” had failed to deliver stability.\n\nThe Department for Education said it was taking “tough decisions” to stabilise universities at a time when public finances were constrained, adding that the Office for Students regulator was closely monitoring the sector’s financial sustainability.\n\n“Whilst [academic] institutions are autonomous, we are committed to restoring universities as engines of opportunity, growth and aspiration,” it added.\n\nPaul Kett, PwC senior adviser on education, said consolidation in the sector threatened more expensive and less popular courses, such as chemistry, while leading to potential “cold spots” in provision.\n\nStern said the precipitous drop-off in international students — who typically pay around three times the annual UK fees of £9,250 — had blindsided universities previously encouraged to recruit internationally to make up for a decade–long freeze in tuition fees.\n\nApplications for UK study visas fell from 474,000 in 2023 to 408,000 in 2024, according to Home Office data, following a decision by the previous Conservative government to remove the right of postgraduates to bring family members.\n\nThe situation was exacerbated by a currency crisis in Nigeria, a key growth market, and competition from other popular destinations, such as Australia and the US, reopening following the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nA report from the OfS estimated a £3.4bn decline in net income across the sector by 2025-26, with nearly three-quarters of universities forecast to be in financial deficit.\n\nA total of 4,900 staff from 21 Russell Group members received severance payments in 2023-24, up by more than a fifth from the previous year. Cardiff, Edinburgh and Glasgow did not give details of the number of staff receiving payouts.\n\nThe group spent more than £348mn in 2023-24 prices on redundancy programmes since the start of the pandemic, when many international students were prevented from travelling.\n\nNottingham and Newcastle had the largest rise in payments, paying out almost £14mn and almost £6mn to former staff, respectively — nearly 10 times the previous year.\n\nAt Newcastle, staff cuts and recruitment freezes were accompanied by bans on overtime, external hospitality and travel.\n\nNewcastle said its higher severance spending was partially linked to the closure of an accommodation block. Nottingham declined to comment.\n\nExeter also significantly increased its severance pay to £8.8mn in the last academic year, up from £1.3mn in 2022-23, blaming frozen tuition fees and declining international student numbers.\n\n“At Exeter we foresaw these challenges and acted proactively, taking concerted action across our operations to ensure we sustain our strong financial position,” a university spokesperson added.",

The foundation has been a long-term funder of journalism, focused on areas such as global health and development.\n\nThe foundation says that such journalism can be costly, often requiring extensive travel, additional time and experienced journalists at a time when news organisations have cut budgets in the face of rapidly shrinking revenue from advertising and subscriptions.\n\nIt sees media organisations as playing a vital role in keeping the public informed and engaged about issues that matter to them and their communities.\n\nThe Independent went digital-only in 2016, which Greig says led to criticism about “a sad day for Fleet Street newspapers” given the end of the print run.\n\nBut he said this was also when the news group started to turn a profit, and it had been consistently profitable since. The acquisition of BuzzFeed has given it a younger audience among Gen Z and millennials, he added.\n\nThe Independent is owned by a group including Evgeny Lebedev, Justin Byam Shaw and Saudi investors, as well as its management.\n\nIn a memo to staff seen by the Financial Times, Greig said the Independent had become the UK’s biggest commercial news website for the first time last year. Ipsos data shows that its UK audience in November was 19.6mn, ahead of the Mail Online, Mirror, Sun and Guardian.\n\nGreig also said that it had become the largest British-based brand in the US in September, according to Comscore data, and the fifth-largest digital publisher behind The New York Times, USA Today, New York Post and The Washington Post.\n\nGreig said the group would continue to invest this year in AI initiatives in the newsroom, as well as expanding its team in the US as Donald Trump enters the White House.",

They receive the same direct government funding as state-maintained schools, but have greater flexibility in how they operate.\n\nThe number of academy schools expanded rapidly after 2010, when successive coalition and Conservative governments passed laws to encourage “academisation”. Over half of all schools in England are now academies.\n\nThe Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill tries to make good on Labour’s manifesto commitment to “meet the needs of all children” by addressing the growing attainment gap between poorer and better-off students.\n\nCurrently academy schools can hire people who do not have qualified teacher status if they complete a one-year course that confirms they have met government standards, and schools can diverge from the national curriculum at their discretion.\n\nThe legislation will mean that academy schools must only employ people with qualified teacher status, will be legally required to follow the national curriculum, and will become part of the national framework on teacher pay and conditions.\n\nLocal councils will also receive powers to force academies to admit children, and to issue compliance orders to academies that are “acting unreasonably”, for example over admissions or imposing uniform requirements that are unaffordable for poorer families.\n\nThe act also rescinds a 2016 law that legally obliged all schools rated “inadequate” by the Ofsted school inspections to become academies. This will now become discretionary.\n\nThat depends who you ask. Education experts say the reforms are less radical than the promises in Labour’s 2017 and 2019 manifestos to bring academies back under the full control of local authorities.\n\nJon Andrews, head of analysis at the Education Policy Institute think-tank, said the proposals are “reasonably measured” compared to what might have been. “The legislation implicitly recognises academies are now part of the system and makes some relatively small changes,” he added.\n\nTeaching unions have praised the changes. Daniel Kebede, the general-secretary of the National Education Union, said academisation had created a “disjointed and more unequal schools system”, calling the legislation a “crucial step toward restoring a level playing field”.\n\nHowever, academy trusts have warned about the impact of the legislation. Leora Cruddas, the chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, the main academy lobby group, argued removing flexibilities over pay and working practices was particularly damaging.\n\n“If this legislation is implemented in the way it is currently drafted it would be a significant retrograde step,” she said.\n\nTory leader Kemi Badenoch described the proposed changes to the school system as “worse than garbage” and “pure vandalism” in a speech on Thursday.\n\nThe party’s main criticisms centre on plans to curtail the academies’ existing powers to deviate from the national curriculum and hire teachers without specified “qualified teacher training”, as well as ending a rule that requires failing schools to be taken over by an academy.\n\nNeil O’Brien, shadow education secretary, also said he is concerned about a provision in the bill that would allow local authorities to intervene in an academy’s admissions decisions.\n\n“They are giving local authorities powers to share out pupils from good schools to prop up failing schools,” he said. “I am very worried about what left-wing local authorities will do with this power.”\n\nLabour grandee Lord David Blunkett, who introduced the first academy schools as education secretary under New Labour, disagreed with this characterisation, arguing the bill did not represent an effort to “unravel what’s been done or go back to some bygone era”.\n\n“I’m in favour of having a national curriculum that applies to all schools,” he told the Financial Times. “We never envisaged that academy schools would wander off on their own as if they were private schools.”\n\nPossibly. Unions are adamant that academies can be locally divisive and that reforms to the school system must aim to create a system that provides opportunity to all children — a position that academy trust heads agree with.\n\nPatrick Roach, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, also said the bill was not removing academy freedoms but “ensuring there are national frameworks, where academies like all other state-funded schools are delivering the best opportunities for all learners”.\n\nCruddas from the Confederation of School Trusts said that the solution, in her view, is not to remove academy freedoms over pay and conditions, but to extend them to all schools — whether academised or local authority controlled.\n\nEducation secretary Bridget Phillipson said that was already in effect the plan when she appeared in front of the Education Select Committee this week, saying that the changes were intended to set a minimum “floor” for all schools, not a “ceiling”.\n\nShe added: “That innovation, that flexibility, that excellence — much of which we have seen within the academy system — I want to be available to all schools.”\n\nThe Confederation of School Trusts said it welcomed the “direction of travel” apparently set by Phillipson, but warned that the legislation would need to be amended to say that schools only have to have “regard” for national pay scales, rather than being “constrained by them”.\n\nA person close to Phillipson disagreed that amendments were necessary, saying that the government can simply mandate that pay scales are a minimum, rather than a maximum.\n\nData visualisations by Amy Borrett",

    "body": "The UK is considering doubling the proposed threshold of foreign state ownership of the country’s news outlets in response to fears that setting the level too low would unnecessarily stifle dealmaking in the media industry.\n\nThe Labour government might allow stakes as large as 10 per cent, significantly higher than the 5 per cent level that the previous Conservative administration was consulting on, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn March last year, the Tories changed the law to ban foreign states from owning stakes in UK news organisations for the first time, a move designed to block the takeover of the Telegraph newspaper by a US investor backed by the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMinisters intended to introduce an exemption to the ban for small stakes under a certain threshold to allow passive investment, particularly in listed media companies, from sovereign wealth and state pension funds. A consultation on setting 5 per cent as the level was ongoing when Labour ousted the Tories at the July UK general election.\n\nOne person with knowledge of the current government’s thinking described 10 per cent as a “sensible” level, adding: “Its all about finding the balance to allow deals to happen without giving any editorial control or influence to foreign states.”\n\nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport said: “We have not made any final decisions on the level of exception for ‘State Owned Investors’ from the new foreign state newspapers regime. We are still considering the consultation responses and will make an announcement in due course.”\n\nThe Telegraph is still without a permanent owner after the Barclay family lost control of the company because of unpaid bank debts, but an attempt to buy the group by RedBird IMI was blocked by the foreign state ownership ban. RedBird IMI is a joint venture between US fund manager RedBird Capital and Abu Dhabi-owned media investment company IMI.\n\nPeople close to the sale said that RedBird Capital could still take a stake in the Telegraph separate to its partnership with IMI.\n\nUK media groups have privately raised concerns with the government that setting the threshold too low could prevent them from being able to tap sources of money from cash-rich states in the Middle East. When the Telegraph was first put up for sale in 2023, for example, the Daily Mail’s owners held talks with investors from Qatar about potentially teaming up on a bid.\n\nMedia executives are also concerned the law will hit state pension funds, such as the vast Norwegian, Canadian and Australian funds that are shareholders in listed media companies.\n\nLabour’s decision on where to set the ownership threshold may be controversial given the fierce debate last year among MPs about the risks of allowing foreign states the ability to exert influence on UK media.\n\nParliamentarians from both main parties were critical of RedBird IMI’s bid, as were executives at the Telegraph itself. Among anxious Tory MPs, a key concern was the potential for overseas control of a right-wing broadsheet seen as influential in their party leadership contests.\n\nThe sale of the Telegraph, which led to intense scrutiny over press freedoms in Abu Dhabi itself, soured relations between the UK and the UAE, which is a major investor in Britain.\n\nEmirati officials expressed frustration about pejorative comments made about their state by a string of British politicians in relation to the proposed Telegraph deal. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith was among MPs who argued the UAE’s involvement would raise “security concerns” despite defence ties between two countries\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer travelled to Abu Dhabi last month hoping to reset relations.",

    "blurb": "Four creatives share their favourite outfits, meals and customs for a prosperous year ahead",
    "date": "2025-01-1800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Come January, in Chinese restaurants and other locations, you may notice red envelopes stuffed with money being passed about, plates of oranges and red dates (believed to bring good luck) and lanterns shaped as snakes (this year’s animal in the Chinese zodiac). These are some of the common emblems of Lunar New Year, a celebration believed to have originated some 3,000 years ago, which marks the beginning of a new year in the Chinese calendar.\n\nThe holiday (also known as Spring Festival in China) this year takes place on January 29 and is celebrated across the world, usually for up to two weeks. For these four creatives who were born or have roots in greater China, the Lunar New Year is one way to maintain a connection to their heritage. Here they share their favourite activities, meals and customs to usher in prosperity and good fortune.\n\n“It’s pretty much like Christmas,” says Robert Wun of the Lunar New Year holiday. “Except it’s longer than one day, and it’s less about religion and more about tradition.” Each of the 15 days during the holiday period have different requirements, he explains, whether it is eating vegetarian dishes (believed to help purify and cleanse the body) or visiting temples to pay respects to certain gods. The latter is harder to do in London, where Wun, who was born and raised in Hong Kong, has resided for the last 17 years. It’s here that he runs his eponymous couture label.\n\n“It’s very rare for me to go back home because Lunar New Year often overlaps with fashion week and we are busy making a new collection,” says Wun. “I’ve ended up having a little community here in London with people from the same culture, so we usually have dinner together.” That could involve hot pot (savoury broth with a platter of meats and vegetables to be communally cooked) at home, or dim sum at Royal China on Baker Street, where he usually orders steamed rice noodle rolls and a Cantonese-style steamed sponge cake (the latter is a favourite of Wun’s grandma). “We share everything — that’s the whole point,” he says.\n\nOn what to wear, Wun recommends: “Nothing that seems shabby.” That includes distressed clothing, even if the style is intentional. He also advises not to carry books around in a bag — something he was often told off for, as a child, when he loved reading comic books. “The word, book, in Chinese sounds similar to the word, losing,” he explains. Opt for colours like red or purple, because they indicate celebration and success, Wun says. They don’t have to be visible, either. “Many friends wear red underwear.”\n\n“I’m a rooster and 100 per cent believe it,” says Patricia Zhou of her Chinese zodiac animal and the traits associated with it. “I’ve read that roosters are meant to be good at focusing on one thing and I do excel at menial tasks. I’m a ballet dancer and I’m always doing the same thing, over and over and over again.”\n\nZhou, whose mother is from Beijing and father from Changsha, grew up near Windsor in Ontario, Canada. Today, she lives in London. Her childhood recollections of Lunar New Year are hazy, but she says that “as I’ve gotten older, I have more memories of celebrating, because it’s a way to connect to my heritage and learn more about my culture.”\n\nThis year, she plans to follow tradition and wear red. “When I was in Shanghai this summer I went to Suzhou and there were a lot of traditional dresses. I tried one on and absolutely loved it. I have it now and think I may wear it for Lunar New Year. It is like a long kilt with corsetry that wraps around the waist and there are beautiful ornaments on the front and back.”\n\nZhou’s favourite thing to eat during the holiday is tang yuan (chewy glutinous rice balls) filled with a sweet sesame paste and served with hot soup. Shrimp, she says, is also on the menu: “The word in Chinese sounds like ‘ha’, which I guess is supposed to sound like laughter, and during the holidays you’re meant to have a lot of that.” But there’s no need to stick too closely to tradition, she notes. “Chinese rice wine is intense. Lately I’ve really gotten into sake, so I plan to have a few friends over and have a sake-tasting with some Chinese food.”\n\nFood is what makes Lunar New Year special for Beijing-born Mimi Xu, who moved to Paris at the age of three with her French-Chinese father and Hong Kong mother. “Chinese tradition is all about eating, isn’t it? It’s huge in France too. Unlike America, where people sometimes have lunch on the go, here we have a proper two- or three-course meal — and with wine!” says Xu, who currently lives in London. “Food is a big part of my life and Lunar New Year is a good opportunity to eat more and host friends.”\n\nXu typically spends the holiday in Paris with her mother. Sometimes, she’ll burn some incense at home and say a prayer. “Lunar New Year is quite spiritual and is a time to reflect.” But this year will be different. As the composer of the musical score for Luz, one of the movies nominated in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition category at the Sundance Film Festival, she will be in Salt Lake City, Utah. “The director and producer is from Hong Kong, and there are a lot of Hong Kong or Taiwanese actors [in the film],” she says, so even while abroad, “I’m sure we’ll celebrate big time.”\n\nOn her return, Xu would like to prepare a Chinese meal at home for friends. Among her key dishes for the holiday are roast duck, steamed turbot with ginger and spring onion, and Chinese broccoli with garlic. “During lockdown I perfected Hainanese chicken rice — the chicken and rice are both cooked with chicken fat, and I do a ginger sauce on the side,” she says. “It’s not the most traditional but it feels festive,” in part because “making it is a long process.”\n\nBorn in Montreal to a Scottish father and Chinese mother, Blake Abbie remembers having to navigate cultural differences as a child. “One of my earliest memories of Lunar New Year is being sent to my relatives and told to bow and ask for hong bao,” he says, referring to red envelopes containing money, typically given as a gift by married couples during holidays and special occasions. “Being mixed race, there were moments when I felt awkward and maybe not so confident doing it, especially with my dad’s family — even though they were incredibly open and respectful.” He adds: “To have two parents who are very engaged in each other’s cultures is a massive privilege.”\n\nAbbie, who now lives in New York, follows the Chinese tradition of not cleaning his hair, clothes or home on the first day of the new Lunar year as those actions could remove one’s good fortune. That means “no taking out the garbage” either, he says. Wearing white should be avoided, he advises, as it’s a colour sometimes worn to Chinese funerals. White flowers or yellow chrysanthemums are not recommended either as they are associated with death and mourning.\n\nFor the food, Abbie recalls: “When I was a kid, we’d have at least eight different dishes. My grandma would make fatty braised pork belly in a clay pot with salted mustard greens” — a speciality dish from Hangzhou where his mother is from. “I don’t eat meat any more but that flavour remains a core memory in my mind.” He also remembers his family serving a whole fish, with the head and tail served intact to represent a positive beginning and end to the year. Ultimately, he says, “it’s about gathering and spending time together. The best part of Lunar New Year now is that so many of my friends [around the world] want to celebrate it.”\n\nFollow us on Instagram and sign up for Fashion Matters, your weekly newsletter about the fashion industry",

    "body": "What do the loneliness epidemic, falling rates of adolescent drinking and dating, and worsening mental health among teenagers and young adults have in common?\n\nFor starters, two of them are disputed to some degree. The paucity of solid historical data on loneliness has led some to question whether there has been any rise at all, let alone an epidemic. And on young adult mental health, some argue that a significant portion of the observed increase in problems is simply picking up cases that would previously have gone undiagnosed, while others point to misleading statistics.\n\nSceptics are not wrong to raise doubts, and there has almost certainly been a degree of overstatement. But as time passes and both data and testimony mount, there is growing acknowledgment that the absence of concrete causal evidence does not constitute evidence of absence. Indeed there is an increasing sense that these phenomena may not only be real, but all part of the same wider shift: plummeting in-person socialising among young people.\n\nUntil recently, the evidence on loneliness was weak at best, but surveys that previously showed it declining among US high school seniors now show steep climbs. In the UK and Europe, new data published in 2024 shows a marked rise in loneliness among people in their twenties. This mirrors patterns in socialising, or rather the lack thereof. As the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson wrote last week, we are increasingly living in the antisocial century. Far from being a US-specific trend, this is sweeping the western world. The share of young people on either side of the Atlantic who regularly meet up socially with friends, family or colleagues has dropped sharply. In Europe, the share who don’t even socialise once a week has risen from one in ten to one in four.\n\nPeople in their teens and twenties now hang out about as much as someone 10 years older than them did in the past. Not so much a case of 30 being the new 20, as 20 being the new 30. Less hanging out and less partying means less sex and less drinking. Both are developments that have been welcomed by the public health community, but they mask a darker side.\n\nTrends in time spent alone are an almost exact parallel of trends in mental health, where rates of mental distress are mounting among the young, but not the middle-aged or older. A wealth of public health research suggests the two are not merely coincidental but causally linked. Time spent alone is strongly associated with lower life satisfaction and even elevated mortality.\n\nSome of the most valuable evidence comes in the form of detailed time-use records from the US and UK, which show a marked increase in time spent alone among teens and young adults over the past decade, but little to no change among older groups. Most importantly, this diary data also captures how people are feeling over the course of their day as they do different things with (or without) different people.\n\nA clear and consistent finding is that more time spent alone is associated with lower life satisfaction, and people report lower levels of happiness when performing the same activity alone compared to with a companion. Using the levels of happiness and meaningfulness that Americans ascribe to various activities in these records, I find that the deterioration in young people’s life satisfaction between 2010 and 2023 can be explained to a substantial degree by changes in how they spend their time.\n\nThe most obvious culprit in terms of timing and age gradient is the proliferation of smartphones and hyper-engaging social media, which has kicked into overdrive with the era of short-form video. Of all the dozens of activities rated in the American time-use data, solitary hours spent gaming, scrolling social media and watching videos are rated as the least meaningful.\n\nThe fact that these ratings are given by the very teens and young adults spending hours glued to their devices underscores the tragedy at the heart of this story: the people suffering are on some level aware of what’s going wrong, but seem powerless to prevent it.\n\nThe last decade is a story of young people retreating from the pursuits that bring them the most fulfilment, and replacing them — consciously or otherwise — with pale imitations. Like the proverbial frog in the pot of water, the damage in any given moment is too subtle to cut through, but several years in we may be starting to reach a roiling simmer.\n\njohn.burn-murdoch@ft.com, @jburnmurdoch\n\nLetter in response to this column:\n\nScotland’s famous philosopher saw the error of his ways / From Michael Nevin, Author, Edinburgh, UK",

    "blurb": "History teaches us that lasting growth depends on new ideas, innovation and technological progress",
    "date": "2025-01-1800:00:00.0",
    "body": "The writer is the author of ‘Growth: A Reckoning’ and an economist at Oxford university and King’s College London\n\nThe British economy is in trouble. Growth is non-existent. Productivity, which already sits below the US, Germany, and France, is falling. Real wages have barely moved for 16 years, their worst run since the Napoleonic Wars. And investors are starting to wobble, pushing borrowing costs up to a 16-year high.\n\nHow did Britain get in this mess — and how does it get out? It is hard to think of a more important question for the country. Yet the new Labour government has still not provided a persuasive answer. Instead, their focus has been on a handful of economic messages that have created unhelpful traps for themselves and actively harmed growth.\n\nIn opposition, the message was “no taxes on working people”. Perhaps this was politically useful, a defence against warnings that they would raid voters’ pay packets. But its presentation was botched, bogging Labour down in weeks of esoteric argument about the true meaning of the word “working”. Worse still, keeping the promise in power has held the economy back.\n\nThis is not a good moment to put the bulk of a mammoth £40bn tax rise — the largest since 1993 — on to business. Small companies are in decline. The number of new start-ups has been falling for five years. Worklessness is stubbornly high. And the aftermath of the eventual national insurance hike — surveys suggesting higher prices and lower wages to come — looks, in effect, like a tax on workers.\n\nIn office, another message took hold: Britain faced a “black hole” in its public finances. This could have been cast as fiscal irresponsibility, requiring new borrowing rules and transparency measures. But instead, Labour presented it as fiscal overspend, repeatedly stressing the vastness of the shortfall (“£22bn”), contorting themselves in unconvincing argumentative gymnastics to avoid the obvious solution to their own framing — more austerity.\n\nAnd again, none of this helped growth. Week after week, we were told about the catastrophic state of Britain, how “difficult decisions” and “tough choices” lay ahead. All that unrelenting pessimism crushed the country’s stirring animal spirits.\n\n“The government,” noted the former chief economist at the Bank of England and FT contributing editor, Andy Haldane, “has generated fear and foreboding, uncertainty . . . which is unfortunate because just after the election there was a sense of refresh, a sense of renewal.”\n\nThe closest the government has come to a diagnosis of what has gone so wrong is their most recent message: we must “fix the foundations”. It is true that Britain does fail to do the basics. We have a backlog of several million houses that need to be built. The application process for the Lower Thames crossing — a tunnel under the river — cost more than twice what it actually cost to build the longest road tunnel in the world in Norway. We haven’t built a nuclear power plant for three decades and our next — Hinkley Point C — is six times more costly than those in South Korea.\n\nIn the pursuit of prosperity, however, it is not enough to simply fix the foundations. Britain must build the future as well.\n\nThe little we know about growth is that it comes not just from old-fashioned investments in roads and houses, but from new ideas, innovation and technological progress. This points towards a deeper diagnosis of what has gone so wrong in Britain: it is not simply that those old-fashioned investments are stagnant, but these other growth-promoting parts of economic life are languishing as well.\n\nBusinesses are struggling to innovate, filing far fewer patents than rivals in Europe and elsewhere, with private R&D now falling as a percentage of GDP. British universities are not helping, doing a wonderful job of producing academic research (57 per cent more publications per capita than the US) but being consistently poor at putting those ideas to productive use.\n\nThe City of London, a traditional source of British vitality, looks exhausted. While the total value of companies on the London Stock Exchange fell since 2007, the value of American stocks trebled. What’s more, the industries choosing Britain are dated. The five largest companies in the UK by market capitalisation are mostly from old-school sectors: oil, mining, finance, chemicals. In the US, it is Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet that dominate.\n\nAnd we know that the technology sector really matters for growth. In the US, it is almost entirely responsible for the country’s astounding productivity performance — three times the pace in the Eurozone and the UK since 2008-09. That is why this week’s AI “action plan” for the UK is encouraging: AI will be the most important technology of the 21st century and the UK has the most valuable AI sector in Europe. It must now build on it, deploying the political leadership and financial resources required to turn the 50 recommendations in that plan into reality.\n\nThree hundred years ago, Britain thundered ahead of its rivals because a fresh spirit took hold — risk-taking, entrepreneurial, aggressive in discovering new ideas about the world, single-minded in putting them to practical use. It is that spirit we need to nurture once again.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nSpirit of adventurism / From Dr Paul Armstrong, Lifford, County Donegal, Ireland\n\nRemember, if you don’t grow it, you have to mine it / From Julian Bennett, Sible Hedingham, Essex, UK",

    "body": "A judge has ruled that green tycoon Dale Vince did not give more than £5mn to the UK Labour party to spite his former wife but at the same time has awarded her over £40mn in a high-profile settlement.\n\nVince, founder of green energy company Ecotricity, was one of three millionaires who each gave Labour £5mn ahead of its landslide general election victory in July.\n\nThe 63-year-old has been embroiled in a divorce case at the Royal Courts of Justice with his former wife Kate, who lived with him from 2000 and married him in 2006.\n\nVince claimed on Friday that his ex-wife had come away from their divorce with £12mn less than the sum he had offered her four years ago, after taking into account legal fees.\n\nLawyers for Ms Vince, 50, had complained to the court that her former husband had been giving away matrimonial assets — including over £5mn of donations to Labour — to which she should have been partly entitled, and keeping her “in the dark” about this.\n\nIn March the High Court ordered Vince to inform his wife before handing over any more cash to the Labour party or to a group called the Green Britain Foundation. He gave £5.5mn to Labour in multiple donations between April 2022 and May 2024.\n\nBut in his judgment, Mr Justice Cusworth said it was “hardly inexplicable” that the tycoon should choose to make a political donation. “I am satisfied that the husband’s motivation in endorsing that transaction was political, and not related to these proceedings,” he said.\n\nVince said the attempt to curtail his political donations was “legal garbage” which had “zero basis in law”.\n\n“It was a move designed to create headlines. The lawyers turned the whole thing into a major circus and the judge has thrown the whole thing out,” he told the FT.\n\nHe said he had offered £50mn to his former wife four years ago, and now she would receive £41.8mn. That would be £38mn net of an estimated £4mn of legal costs, he said.\n\nDale was previously a donor to the direct action group Just Stop Oil until he decided to back the Labour party instead on the back of its commitment to tackling climate change.\n\nMs Vince’s lawyer, Sarah Jane Lenihan from Dawson Cornwell, said her client “happily pays tribute to Mr Vince’s many talents, which have been and will be of great value to the community and to the country”.\n\nShe said the settlement reflected her client’s major contributions throughout the marriage during which time Vince built the majority of his fortune.",

    "body": "Gilts posted their best week since July and the FTSE 100 hit a record high on Friday after a string of weak data weighed on sterling and prompted bets that the Bank of England will cut interest rates more aggressively to kick-start growth.\n\nThe rally in UK government bonds continued on Friday after official figures showed retail sales unexpectedly dropped in December, raising the risk the economy contracted at the end of last year.\n\nThe 10-year gilt yield fell another 0.02 percentage points to 4.66 per cent, taking its drop to 0.18 percentage points this week. Yields move inversely to prices.\n\nThe signs of weakness on the high street follow disappointing GDP figures for November and a lower-than-forecast inflation reading in December. The IMF on Friday afternoon predicted a pick-up in UK growth this year, but the expansion is still set to be slower than in the US and Canada.\n\nThe FTSE 100 rose 1.4 per cent, taking it past its previous record high hit in May, helped by the weaker pound. Many of the companies in the blue-chip index are dollar earners, meaning they benefit from a stronger US currency.\n\n“The better news on inflation let gilts be the safe haven asset the market now increasingly feels it needs in the UK,” said Gordon Shannon, a portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management.\n\nRising expectations of rate cuts to support a stagnating economy had made it “easier for foreign buyers to step back in [and buy gilts]”, added Shannon.\n\nThe two-year yield fell 0.02 percentage points to 4.37 per cent on Friday, taking its drop this week to 0.17 percentage points. Sterling fell 0.6 per cent against the dollar to $1.217.\n\n“It’s more than pound weakness,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, of the FTSE high. “I find the UK attractive as a market,” he added, saying it was “cheap” on valuation grounds and “well diversified”.\n\nTraders now anticipate at least two quarter-point rate reductions this year from the current level of 4.75 per cent, and a roughly two-thirds chance of a third cut, according to levels implied in swaps markets.\n\nDespite the rally in the gilt market, 10-year yields remained substantially above the 3.75 per cent level they were in mid-September, before a sell-off driven by both Treasuries and fears the UK is contending with stagflation — where persistent price rises make it difficult for the Bank of England to cut rates.\n\nThat took the UK’s borrowing costs to a 16-year high last week, the higher yields attracting a wave of retail investors but also forcing chancellor Rachel Reeves to defend her economic plans before MPs.\n\nThe rise in borrowing costs has severely curbed the headroom that the chancellor has against her self-imposed fiscal rules. Big gilt investors have warned that the government might be forced to raise taxes, or cut spending, to maintain credibility with the market.\n\nIn an update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said on Friday the UK economy would grow 1.6 per cent in 2025 — a 0.1 percentage point increase on the previous forecast and up from 0.9 per cent last year. UK growth would continue at a similar pace of 1.5 per cent in 2026, it said.\n\nThe outlook was welcomed by Reeves, who said the IMF forecast suggested the UK would be the fastest-growing “major European economy” over the next two years. “I will go further and faster in my mission for growth through intelligent investment and relentless reform, and deliver on our promise to improve living standards in every part of the UK,” she said.\n\nBut traders betting on rate cuts were encouraged by a speech earlier this week by one of the central bank’s rate-setters that it might need to cut rates five or six times over the coming year to support the economy.\n\nAlan Taylor, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, warned that recent UK data pointed to “an increasingly gloomy outlook for 2025”, as he argued the central bank needed to take pre-emptive action to support the economy with lower borrowing costs.\n\nWhile expectations of lower rates will provide some relief to the chancellor when it comes to UK government borrowing costs, the poorer growth prospects that accompany them could have a negative bearing on fiscal forecasts if the weakness is judged to be persistent.\n\nThe government’s Office for Budget Responsibility is due to present its new economic and fiscal outlook on March 26, with the chancellor set to respond with a statement to parliament.\n\nUK gilts have been helped by a trailing wind from US Treasuries, which have also rallied as data showed weaker underlying inflation pressures in the US economy. That has taken the 10-year Treasury yield down 0.16 percentage points this week to 4.61 per cent.",

    "blurb": "Unlike physical assets, those we cannot see have never been tested by rising prices",
    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "If you’re a rich Latin American you’re probably just back from Punta del Este. Qué bueno! The Uruguayan beach town is a fabulous mix of Miami and the French Riviera. And almost as expensive due to years of cash flowing in to escape the inflation in neighbouring countries such as Argentina. What’s nicer than an ocean-view apartment to preserve your wealth in real terms?\n\nPhysical assets have always had this appeal. But modern economies are not the same as they were half a century ago when inflation last reigned supreme. Nowadays, things you can touch are less relevant. Land, buildings, resources and financial securities still make up the bulk of national balance sheets. In the west, however, the value of brands, patents, software, data, research and development and so on, has outpaced tangible asset growth for decades.\n\nUK intangible investment now exceeds £200bn annually — a fifth more than tangible investment. Unlike the latter, though, intangibles and high inflation have never coexisted at scale for long. One day they might. Although December consumer prices in America and the UK were cooler than expected on Wednesday, the relief rally in equities and bonds shows just how nervous markets are.\n\nShould prices rise further from here, equity holders have much to worry about. That is because corporations have driven the global explosion in intangible assets. For example in 1975, when headline inflation in the US was in double digits, almost 85 per cent of company assets was tangible stuff such as plant and machinery, transportation equipment and inventory. In the intervening half century the split has reversed. Intangible assets now account for 90 per cent of S&P 500 balance sheets. This occurred as inflation fell to almost a side show. Therefore, most equity owners have never pondered what happens to their intangible-heavy stocks if consumer prices surge.\n\nIn theory, high inflation should have no effect on the value of tangible or intangible assets. But things are much harder in practice. For starters, intangible assets are slippery to value. There are no traded prices. The “expected future economic benefit” of a trademark, say, is anyone’s guess at the best of times. Companies already spend fortunes paying accountants to arrive at intangible asset values they are happy with. Add high and volatile inflation and imagine how accurate such estimates become.\n\nWith global mergers and acquisition volumes approaching $4tn last year, this is cause for concern. Even with low inflation, the prevalence of intangibles raises the likelihood that companies overpay for each other. This normally happens in two ways. Either future profits or historical asset values are overstated. Most likely both. So it is unhelpful when analysing companies that accountants cannot resolve a long-running dispute. Namely, whether something such as an R&D department is an asset that needs to be on a balance sheet and depreciated like a machine, or an expense on a profit and loss account. Both can be fudged but some consistency would be welcome.\n\nWorse, the value of “internally generated” intangible assets such as customer databases or trade names are not recognised, full stop. Until, that is, someone comes along and buys the company at which point they pop into view as “goodwill” on the balance sheet. The more deals, the more goodwill builds up. Until it doesn’t. This time last year Walgreens, a US pharmacy, wrote down $12.4bn of goodwill related to a historical acquisition.\n\nPerhaps the biggest risk from high inflation is that such “badwill” can stay hidden. Why? Because it sits on a balance sheet at a constant value (provided it isn’t written down) no matter what happens to inflation. So as revenues and profits zoom upwards in line with higher prices, the intangible assets that help to generate them remain fixed at “cost”. This boosts returns.\n\nThus even the worst dealmaking chief executive is a genius if inflation is high enough. Goodwill that would have been written down in periods of low inflation can now sit there for years. Until some idiot buys the company.\n\nWhat of the question of whether intangible assets are good inflation hedges? Certainly an income-generating patent can hold its value, as should a highly trained workforce. But be honest. If your country became Venezuela tomorrow, would you rather own a factory and its land or an R&D department? A state of the art robot or a copyright?\n\nAnd you might also suppose something as ethereal as a brand is the last thing you’d want. Wrong, say marketing types. Brand loyalty is even more valuable when price hikes fray customer nerves. But academic research on inflation in emerging markets is unequivocal. People switch to cheaper alternatives. Or buy a condo in Punta.\n\nstuart.kirk@ft.com",

    "blurb": "School and workers’ rights reforms jar with the government’s stated growth mission",
    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government’s plea to regulators to come up with ideas for growth is easily lampooned. It’s not entirely foolish to put regulators on notice that their remits may change — but only as long as you also consult those who know what it’s like to be regulated. Here, as so often with this government, the signals are confusing.\n\nGoverning is hard. There is some schadenfreude, among veterans of previous administrations, at Labour’s dawning recognition of this after six months in office. When Sir Keir Starmer railed against what he called the “tepid bath of managed decline”, he was expressing frustration felt by every new prime minister. But in his case, things are made worse by the lack of a clear governing philosophy.\n\nThe new administration is full of energised ministers, working hard. But there is little read-across. The cabinet feels more like a group of individuals with wildly divergent views of the world than a team with anything approaching a coherent analysis of what ails Britain, and what to do about it.\n\nListening to the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster vowing to “make the state more like a start up”, the science and technology minister waxing lyrical about artificial intelligence, or the health secretary talking about patient choice, it’s possible to feel optimistic. An entirely different impression is generated by the education secretary, who is seeking to turn the clock back by ripping up two decades of cross-party policy that improved schools. And by the deputy prime minister, whose gargantuan workers’ rights package is further undermining business confidence, even as the Treasury tries to restore it.\n\nAll governing parties are a coalition of interests. But the extent of the dissonance in this case makes it hard to be sure where this government will land on any given issue. Which in turn makes it hard to build trust.\n\nThe argument for Angela Rayner’s employment rights bill is that the UK’s low productivity is partly explained by insecure work. In that light, some of the measures seem reasonable: abolishing “fire and rehire” practices that impose new terms and conditions on workers, helping the self-employed get paid on time, and softening some aspects of zero-hours contracts. But the bill contains a whole slew of other rules: on rights to sick pay from day one, on parental leave and unfair dismissal, on stronger union powers and others that directly contradict the growth mission that Starmer claims is central.\n\nInsecure work may indeed be bad for productivity. But so is no work at all. The independent Regulatory Policy Committee has slammed the government’s impact assessment of the bill as “not fit for purpose”, and warned that the measures will hurt low-wage workers. Business surveys suggest the bill will accelerate moves to invest in technology not people. The complexity and scale of the new rights mean — of course — that a whole new regulator will be created to oversee them.\n\nNumber 10 and the Treasury are scarred by the business reaction to the rise in national insurance, and deeply anxious about recent economic news. You would think they would be radically rowing back on the employment proposals. Instead, a weak compromise of a nine-month probationary period has been offered on the issue of unfair dismissal.\n\nGiven the concerns over what the package may to do workers’ prospects, only two groups stand unequivocally to benefit: lawyers and trade unions. Something similar applies to the schools bill from the education department, where secretary of state Bridget Phillipson seems to be freelancing with no link to anything the rest of government is doing.\n\nPhillipson wants to dismantle the reforms that were started by Labour’s Andrew Adonis, who grew up in care, and later turbocharged by the Conservative Michael Gove, the adopted son of a Scottish fish processor. The reforms pushed England’s schools up the international rankings to be some of the best in the world. They were based on the twin principles of creating academy schools with more freedoms, for example to pay good teachers more, and requiring greater accountability through league tables. Academies became the tool for turning round failing schools.\n\nPhillipson wants to sweep much of this away, with no convincing alternative philosophy of how to drive up standards. Her answer to what should be done about schools ranked as “inadequate” seems to be to replace that word with something broader, which won’t give parents the same clarity\n\nNone of this makes any sense. There are improvements that could have been made, for example to the scrutiny of multi-academy trusts. But why change a system that has helped large numbers of the poorest children?\n\nWhen it comes to investment, Labour’s majority has brought some much-needed political stability. But investors also need confidence in the consistent direction of policy. They need an educated and flexible labour market, too. To ignore that seems unwise, to say the least.\n\nUnlike Boris Johnson, Starmer is neither lazy nor chaotic. But like Johnson, he is finding out that ideas, some of them very bad indeed, fill any hint of a vacuum at the centre. In meetings, he is known for asking for solutions, not problems. But in Whitehall, the most intractable questions move upwards through the system until they land on the prime minister’s desk. Without a clearer indication of what he wants, it will be hard to drive the machine.\n\ncamilla.cavendish@ft.com",

    "body": "Manchester United’s plans to rebuild or redevelop Old Trafford are set to drive one of the UK’s “biggest ever urban regeneration projects”, according to new proposals.\n\nThe Premier League club will decide by the end of this season whether to build a new 100,000-capacity ground, creating the country’s biggest stadium, or upgrade and expand the existing one.\n\nEither option will spearhead 100 acres of sports-led regeneration immediately next door to Manchester city centre, according to plans drawn up by a task force including Lord Sebastian Coe, who led the London 2012 Olympics, local authorities and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.\n\nIts initial proposals, published on Friday, promise new housing, entertainment venues and transport links.\n\nSpeculation about the future of Old Trafford, the condition of which is a major bugbear for fans, has been rife since the chemicals billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe bought a significant stake in the club last year.\n\nRatcliffe has previously pledged a “Wembley of the North” in its place. Last month his firm Ineos agreed a $100mn cash injection, said to be earmarked for new infrastructure.\n\nIn practice the club has yet to publicly choose between a new ground or a redevelopment.\n\nThe task force has now drawn up two options.\n\nAn entirely new stadium is the most popular among fans, it said, backed by 52 per cent of those surveyed.\n\nThe second option would redevelop and expand the existing ground, taking its capacity from 78,000 to 87,000.\n\nA task force paper being proposed to council leaders next week said that funding and delivery options were “still being assessed”.\n\nIn the meantime, the club and local leaders are proposing a mayoral development corporation — a separate body designed to streamline land assembly and investment, which would be overseen by Burnham — to redevelop the wider area into a “world-class, sports-led visitor destination”.\n\nThat would include not only the area immediately around the ground, but land stretching into the nearby Wharfside, across the water from the BBC’s northern headquarters at MediaCity.\n\nBurnham dubbed the proposal “the largest opportunity for urban regeneration” since London 2012.\n\nCoe said the plan would drive growth not only locally, but across the north-west.\n\n“At the heart of the plan is a world-class football stadium which will act as a catalyst for one of the biggest regeneration projects ever undertaken in the UK,” he said.Proposals are being drawn up for the relocation of rail freight companies immediately to the west of the ground, as part of a bigger exercise aimed at freeing up the region’s notoriously congested rail routes for more passenger services. The taskforce’s proposals would require involvement from central government to co-ordinate heavy rail services, as well as investment in new local transport links. Representatives of the project are expected at the Davos summit in Switzerland next week as part of moves to engage investor interest, as well as at the Mipim property conference in France in March.",

    "blurb": "FCA chief commits to ‘deep reforms’ on mortgage rules and anti-money laundering checks to help boost economic growth",
    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK financial watchdog has sent a shot across the bow of Sir Keir Starmer’s pro-growth push, warning that its plans to water down swaths of regulation will cause more failures that harm consumers.\n\nNikhil Rathi, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the prime minister that its commitment to wind back rules over mortgages and anti-money laundering checks would work only if it had “enduring acceptance” by the government that “we need to prioritise resources and that there will be failures”.\n\nCalling for the watchdog to be given “metrics for tolerable failures”, Rathi told Starmer in a letter released on Friday: “We will not stop all harm when making risk-based choices about the cases and intelligence we pursue.”\n\nRathi, in his response to the government’s call for more pro-growth measures, said the watchdog would consult on lifting some of the limits on riskier mortgage lending imposed on banks in response to the heavy losses of the 2008 financial crisis, when many lenders were bailed out by the state.\n\nHe said the FCA could “go even further” by relaxing anti-money laundering requirements for companies to carry out checks on the identity of customers for smaller transactions.\n\nThe letter, which was also sent to chancellor Rachel Reeves and business secretary Jonathan Reynolds, committed to “deep reforms” to make economic growth “a cornerstone of our strategy, through to 2030”.The government last month called on the FCA and 16 other UK regulators to present ideas for rule changes that could increase risk-taking and investment in the economy, as Starmer seeks to deliver on his promise to boost growth — a core mission of his administration.\n\nThe Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn response to an earlier Financial Times report that the FCA had proposed allowing banks to lend more mortgages to first-time buyers with smaller deposits and lower incomes, the Treasury said Reeves would examine the regulator’s proposals and work closely with it to develop them further.\n\nThe FCA last year proposed a number of pro-growth measures to make it easier for companies to go public, lighten rules on bankers’ pay, strip back the disclosure requirements to investors and streamline its 10,000-page rule book.\n\nOther proposals in Rathi’s letter included plans to reduce reporting requirements that he said would benefit 16,000 companies, and to allow start-ups to partially launch before they have met all requirements for full authorisation.\n\nRob Hailey at hedge fund trade body MFA welcomed the plan to reduce transaction reporting requirements for asset managers, calling them “duplicative and burdensome”.\n\nThe FCA said it could raise the £100 spending limit on contactless card transactions, which was imposed because of fears of fraud but already does not apply to contactless payments via phones.\n\nThe watchdog also said it would “begin simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and opening a discussion on the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults”.\n\nUK mortgage lending is controlled by a mixture of rules from the FCA and the Bank of England. They restrict how much banks can lend as a multiple of a person’s income or the value of a property and require affordability tests to check if borrowers could cope with future interest rate rises.\n\nThe idea of easing mortgage rules was welcomed by Charles Roe, director of mortgages at trade body UK Finance. “Reviewing the mortgage lending rules would help with affordability issues, not just for first-time buyers but also those looking to move further up the housing ladder,” he said.\n\nRichard Donnell, executive director at property portal Zoopla, said the “big hurdle” preventing more people from getting a mortgage was the stress test of affordability, which requires banks to test if borrowers can cope with a rise in borrowing costs.\n\n“This has come at the cost of pricing more people out of the market,” said Donnell, adding that before the recent rise in interest rates, lenders typically stress-tested if borrowers could afford a rate of about 6 per cent and that had risen as high as 8-9 per cent.\n\nBut Sir Vince Cable, former Liberal Democrat business secretary in the 2010-2015 coalition government, said relaxing mortgage requirements could be highly risky.\n\n“It seems ominously similar to trends two decades ago which culminated in the mad 125 per cent Northern Rock mortgages and self-certification, which did not end well,” he said. “Even if there is no systemic risk, this would add demand without supply — we know where that leads.”",

    "body": "Socialite James Stunt has told his money laundering trial that he would have stopped large cash deliveries from taking place at his offices in London’s Mayfair “if anyone had raised an objection”.\n\nProsecutors cross-examined the former son-in-law of Formula 1 magnate Bernie Ecclestone on Friday after they accused him of being part of a scheme allowing criminals to funnel more than £200mn of “dirty money” into the banking system.\n\nJurors heard that Stunt had started a joint venture with Fowler Oldfield, a Bradford-based precious metals and jewellery dealer that prosecutors claim was a financial “gateway” for criminals between 2014 and 2016.\n\nTestifying at Leeds Crown Court, Stunt acknowledged he allowed client cash from Fowler Oldfield to be delivered to his offices, but insisted he had no knowledge of criminality.\n\nJonathan Sandiford KC, for the prosecution, asked Stunt whether the sight of “men in helmets” from security company G4S delivering “large sums of cash” to his “plush Mayfair office” fitted with the image his company was seeking to project.\n\nStunt said: “If anyone had raised an objection that this was something untoward I would have shut [it] down immediately . . . There was no objection to this whatsoever.”\n\nAsked by what means he had envisaged the cash was to be delivered, Stunt said: “Obviously, not a bin liner”. He added: “I don’t believe anyone would have come in looking like a hooligan.”\n\nStunt said he accepted that his company’s staff counted the cash, but “it [the money] wasn’t anything to do with Stunt and Co. It was Fowler Oldfield’s client cash.”\n\nHe added: “I had a financial interest in the joint venture and I was willing to assist.” But “I didn’t actually make any money [from it] — I lost money.”\n\nStunt, 42, who was previously married to Ecclestone’s daughter Petra for six years, is one of five individuals standing trial charged with money laundering.\n\nThe Ecclestones are not defendants and are not accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors have claimed the scheme allowed unnamed criminals to circumvent financial due-diligence checks and hide the illicit sources of their funds, most of which were used to buy gold.\n\nStunt has insisted he had no knowledge of money laundering, telling jurors this week that at no stage did he suspect he was entering into an agreement to facilitate any such activity.\n\nThe defendants deny the charges and the trial continues.",

    "body": "Some of the UK’s biggest pension providers saw record flows into sharia-compliant funds last year following much better returns than their default products.\n\nNational Employment Savings Trust (Nest), the UK’s state-backed pension scheme, drew more than £180mn into its sharia fund last year, boosting assets under management by around a third.\n\nMeanwhile People’s Partnership’s sharia fund almost doubled in size in 2024, as investors were drawn to the fund which delivered a return of 30 per cent, while Aviva added a sharia multi-asset fund to its self-select pension offering.\n\nSharia funds, which eschew investments that violate tenets of the Islamic faith, have outperformed their default peers over the past decade — and notably last year — owing to their heavy exposure to US technology stocks.\n\nIn 2024, European flows into Islamic global equity funds were more than twice as large as any other year in the past decade, according to data from Morningstar.\n\n“[Last year] was a particularly impressive year,” said Dan Mikulskis, chief investment officer of People’s Partnership, with a sharia fund that returned almost 30 per cent. He added that a flurry of new investors “could be partly due to non-Muslim members of the scheme being attracted to the fund’s past performance”.\n\nIslam’s sharia law forbids the charging of interest and earning income from gambling, tobacco and alcohol, among other “haram” business activities. Portfolios must be certified by specialist boards of Islamic scholars, who screen investments within sharia indices on the basis of their business activities and their debt, cash and interest-based income levels to determine whether they are compliant.\n\n“This creates slight biases — for example, private equity is very difficult [to invest in] because of the leverage, [but] tech companies tend to pass the screens,” said Chris Redmond, head of manager research at pensions consultancy Willis Towers Watson.\n\nSharia indices are reviewed periodically and securities that exceed a threshold for haram activities are removed.\n\nA portion of the dividends from the remaining investments — in line with the amount of money they make from prohibited activities — is often donated to charity, explained Maya Marissa Malek, chief executive of Amanie Advisors, which provides guidance on Islamic investments.\n\nRedmond said that a regulatory push to serve all pension savers, together with a growth in the size of defined contribution pension schemes, had spurred providers to improve their provision in recent years.\n\n“DC pension schemes are the biggest game in town, and as those schemes grow larger, they have more bandwidth to take the time to find a sharia-compliant scheme,” said Redmond.\n\nThe UK has been at the forefront of sharia fund investment in part because of its large British Muslim population.\n\nIn 2022, Uber’s UK pensions provider launched a new sharia fund following the threat of legal action from a trade union. NOW Pensions, one of the UK’s largest pension plans, created its sharia fund after the App Drivers & Couriers Union said it would take Uber to court over the issue. The union said the lack of a sharia option had made the pension scheme “effectively . . . inaccessible” for Uber’s Muslim-majority workforce.\n\nHSBC Asset Management, among the largest providers of Islamic funds globally, said that UK DC pension schemes held $5.3bn of its flagship Islamic Global Equity Index Fund’s $7.3bn in assets under management, as of September 30 2024.\n\n“There’s been a notable pick-up in interest over the past five to six years, in line with the broader interest in ethical investing,” said Sefian Kasem, head of investment specialists, ETF strategy, at HSBC Asset Management.\n\nThe “lion’s share” of new flows into Islamic global equities “went into broad passive equity funds, reflecting trends we see in the broader market,” added Kenneth Lamont, strategist at Morningstar.\n\nPension experts say that sharia funds’ high exposure to groups of similar stocks presents a risk. Nest, the UK’s state-backed pension scheme with its own £620mn sharia fund, said it feared the vehicles were “too concentrated” in “US-based technology stocks” and would eventually require “cushioning as stock markets can be volatile and incur losses during downturns”.\n\nNest’s sharia fund has delivered annualised returns of 15 per cent over the past decade, compared with 7 per cent for the pension scheme’s “starter” fund and 9 per cent for its “higher risk” fund. But the sharia fund has been relatively volatile, including an 8 per cent decline in 2022.\n\nRedmond, the pensions consultant, said that “in the context of global equities, the universe is more constrained than non-sharia funds, but it’s still pretty diversified — there are [several hundred] companies you can invest in. When you get to some of the other asset classes, you need to be a bit more cautious because the universe becomes quite small”.",

    "body": "Bonus season has the promise of even greater riches for City workers this year after British and US banks scrapped EU-imposed bonus caps — but how will yours measure up?\n\nWith M&A activity on the rise, some UK-based bankers and lawyers are ebullient about their salary and bonus prospects for this year and beyond. However, increased payout ratios may come at the cost of lower base salaries, further concentrating rewards in the hands of top dealmakers.\n\nFor the fourth successive year, the Financial Times is asking readers confidentially to share their bonus round expectations; how they have noticed pay policies shifting and whether they intend to invest, save or spend any cash they are awarded.\n\nThis year’s results are expected to be the first year that bonus cap changes will be fully reflected in the pay packages of top earners. Although the cap was removed in 2023, British-based banks have taken time to review and fully implement their pay policies, presenting a mixed landscape.\n\nWhile European banks in London must still cap bonuses at twice base salary, Barclays and JPMorgan have decided to award so-called material risk takers up to 10 times their fixed pay, while Goldman Sachs has opted to cut base pay, but increase the bonus ratio to 25 times.\n\nThe legal profession is expected to be the other big winner this bonus season, as the arrival of big US law firms in the capital disrupts the market, fuelling pay wars for talent.\n\nReaders will be able to tell us anonymously how any changes will affect their personal pay prospects, as well as altering competition dynamics in the wider recruitment market.\n\nThe survey also gives readers the chance to say how Labour’s first Budget has affected their financial planning, from the expense of paying VAT on school fees to how proposed inheritance tax changes make pension saving less attractive.\n\nLast year’s FT bonus survey revealed that many well-paid professionals were squeezed by a combination of smaller payouts and higher interest rates.\n\nCompleted by nearly 3,000 FT readers, 58 per cent said their bonus had fallen or flatlined compared with the previous year, and there was a sharp jump [64 per cent] in the numbers of people who said they intended to use their bonus to reduce mortgage debts. However, half of respondents still intended to invest the bulk of any bonus payout tax-efficiently.\n\nChanges to the banker bonus cap were in progress at the time of last year’s poll, but four out of five FT readers said they would prefer safety over glory, favouring a high base salary and a limited bonus, as opposed to a low base salary and an unlimited bonus.\n\nThe results of the anonymous poll will be collated and published in the coming weeks.

    "blurb": "Interview: PM says tariffs ‘aren’t in anybody’s interests’ ahead of president-elect’s inauguration on Monday",
    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer, Britain’s prime minister, said he could strike a trade deal with Donald Trump and avoid punitive tariffs on the UK as he dismissed as “noises off” Elon Musk’s strident criticism of his leadership.\n\nStarmer, speaking to the Financial Times on a visit to Kyiv, insisted Trump’s inauguration on Monday would not add to his political woes, saying they had a “constructive” relationship that would survive the outpourings of the incoming president’s ally Musk, the world’s richest man.\n\n“What matters to me is my relationship with the US and my relationship with president-elect Trump,” Starmer said, shrugging aside the FT’s recent revelations that Musk had been exploring ways to oust him from Downing Street.\n\n“In the end my experience is that you have to focus on what matters,” he said, referring to Musk’s suggestion that he is the leader of a “tyrannical” government. “Ignore the noises off.”\n\nTrump has asked Musk to help his new administration slash US bureaucracy. Starmer too said he would be “ruthless with cuts” if needed to keep to Labour’s fiscal rules after the rise in UK borrowing costs in recent months.\n\nStarmer sets great store on what he believes is a strong early relationship with Trump, despite the president-elect’s close ties with his domestic rival Nigel Farage, and the Trump campaign in October accusing his Labour party of interfering in the US election.\n\nStarmer has repeatedly harked back to the president-elect hosting him for dinner at Trump Tower in New York last September.\n\n“He made a huge effort,” Starmer said, sitting in a puffa jacket in Kyiv’s traditional Kanapa restaurant, a log fire burning in the corner. “He came to New York to have dinner with me and I was very grateful for that.”\n\nThe relationship is now about to be tested, especially if Trump follows through on his threat to impose new global tariffs.\n\n“Tariffs aren’t in anybody’s interests,” said Starmer, as plates of dumplings and mushrooms begin to arrive. “Our ambition is to have a deal of some sorts with the US, a trade deal. That’s where our focus is.”\n\nSome kind of UK-US trade deal has been the dream of successive British prime ministers since Brexit, but has never materialised. Starmer rejected the “false choice” that he would have to choose between a deal with Trump or a better trade deal with the EU.\n\nThe timing of Starmer’s visit to Kyiv on Thursday — days before Trump’s inauguration — was a symbolic show of the UK’s continued support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy: the two men signed a “100-year partnership” between the two countries.\n\nBut it was also an opportunity for Starmer to indicate to Trump that Britain was prepared to join France and other European allies by stepping up to the plate — possibly by putting peacekeepers on the ground — if Ukraine agreed to end the war with Russia.\n\nTrump last month told Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron that he expected Europeans to secure the peace, but Starmer said he was confident the new US president would help put Ukraine in “the strongest possible position” ahead of any peace talks.\n\n“He’s acutely aware of the contribution the US has made here,” said Starmer, whose visit to Kyiv was accompanied by Russian drone activity over the city. “That’s very important to both of us. I think he absolutely understands the critical role the US will play in relation to this.”\n\nZelenskyy on Thursday listed the US as one of those countries — along with Germany, Hungary and Slovakia — that oppose Ukraine’s membership of Nato. Starmer said he would “urge” those countries to keep the door open.\n\nMeanwhile, Starmer has had to put on hold a deal to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands — home to the US/UK Diego Garcia military base — from the UK to Mauritius amid fears from some in the Trump team that it could surrender influence to China.\n\n“I think it’s right that he scrutinises it,” Starmer said, after the prime minister bowed to a request from Trump to study the deal before it is signed. But he insisted the deal would secure the long-term legal future of the base.\n\nWould Trump be happy to see Starmer’s continued rapprochement with Beijing, including his attempts to generate more UK-China trade? “Let’s see,” he said. “The US is our closest ally. It’s usually best not to get ahead of ourselves.”\n\nStarmer has enough economic problems without Trump making them worse, as Britain battles the threat of “stagflation”, with inflation above the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target coupled with near-zero growth. Business and markets have become increasingly gloomy.\n\nBut the prime minister insisted that his long-term economic strategy was working and that his critics should stop being hung up on daily economic data, rejecting suggestions that Rachel Reeves’ future as chancellor in some way depended on whether inflation last month was 2.5 per cent or 2.6 per cent.\n\n“I’ve always said it would take time,” Starmer said, arguing that investment into Britain was strong. “I don’t think that overreacting to each and every single decimal point on a daily basis is necessarily reflective. We know it’s going to be a long-term journey.”\n\nThe UK’s 10-year gilt yield hit a post-financial crisis high of 4.93 per cent last week, but had since fallen to 4.66 per cent by the close on Friday. Gilts have rallied as weaker than expected inflation, growth and sales data prompted investors to increase their bets on interest rate cuts from the BoE.\n\nStarmer claimed that if borrowing costs exceeded expectations and blew a hole in Reeves’ fiscal plans, he would not hesitate to act, even if it risked a big confrontation with Labour MPs and many of his own ministers.\n\n“We will be ruthless with cuts if that’s what’s necessary,” he said. “In the end the fiscal rules and our commitment to them is iron-clad.” Starmer insisted that last year’s Budget, with its £40bn tax increase, had laid the foundations for growth.\n\n“It’s about setting conditions, it’s about stability, it’s about certainty,” he said. “It’s about not chopping and changing — it’s about sticking to the decisions that were made, tough though they were and right though they were.”\n\nStarmer’s approval ratings have plummeted since the general election and Labour, according to one YouGov poll, is now just one point ahead of Farage’s Reform UK party. Nerves on the Labour benches are jangling.\n\n“I love fights,” Starmer said, as he contemplated the long train journey out of Kyiv. “I had to fight to get the leadership of the Labour party, I had to fight to win the election. Five years ago people said, ‘he wouldn’t be able to do it’, but I said, ‘watch this space’.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Ian Smith in London",

    "blurb": "Officials push back implementation of new Basel regime until 2027 as they await clarity on US approach ",
    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The Bank of England has delayed the start of new capital rules for British banks by a year while it waits to see how the incoming Trump administration will implement the global Basel agreement in the US.\n\nThe announcement by the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority on Friday that it would postpone the start of the stricter capital regime in the UK until January 2027 underlines how regulators around the world are nervously watching to see what impact Donald Trump will have on financial regulation.\n\nIt also comes as regulators in the UK are under pressure from the government to ease rules that might restrict growth.\n\nThe Basel III regime was first drawn up more than a decade ago to increase the amount of equity available to absorb stress in banks and to avoid a repeat of the state bailouts that followed the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe PRA said last year it was modifying the so-called Basel 3.1 rules to reduce the extra capital required for British banks and to delay the implementation until January 2026. It had previously pushed back the start date for the new capital regime by six months in 2023.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve has already watered down its plans for applying its so-called Basel Endgame rules on American banks after heavy lobbying by the sector. The regulations are expected to be further diluted or even abandoned under the Trump administration.\n\nIn a statement, the PRA said: “Given the current uncertainty around the timing of implementation of the Basel 3.1 standards in the US, and taking into account competitiveness and growth considerations, the PRA, having consulted with HM Treasury, has decided to further delay implementation of the rules.”\n\nShares in UK banks rose at the open on Friday morning, with Barclays up 1.7 per cent, Lloyds 1.2 per cent and NatWest 1 per cent.\n\nThe move reflects mounting pressure from the UK government on regulators to find ways of reducing the burden of bureaucracy in a push to support British economic growth and competitiveness. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told international investors last year he would “rip up the bureaucracy that blocks investment” in the UK.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is meeting the heads of many of the UK’s main regulators this month, including PRA chief executive Sam Woods, to call for rule changes that will boost growth in the stagnant British economy.\n\nWoods told a House of Lords committee last week that the PRA planned to ease the burden of regulation by allowing insurers to seek retrospective permission for their investments, rather than forcing them to ask beforehand. He said it also aimed to cut banks’ reporting requirements this year, having already cut them by a third for insurers.\n\nThe PRA said on Friday it had paused its plans to start collecting data on the extra capital buffers it sets for each bank, known as Pillar 2 requirements, which had been due to be completed by the end of March.\n\nBut the UK’s one-year delay to the start of the stricter Basel capital rules will not change the ultimate end point for when they fully come into force. The PRA said the transition period would be compressed to keep the final implementation date at January 2030.\n\nThe UK move follows the EU’s decision last year to press ahead with introducing some of the Basel rules this month, while postponing the part of its package that covers investment banks’ trading books by a further year.\n\nThe UK Finance trade body welcomed the PRA’s “pragmatic” announcement, saying: “Given the cross-border nature of banking, international co-ordination on capital rules is important.”\n\nSteven Hall, a partner at consultancy KPMG, said the PRA’s delay would leave the EU “further out of line” with the UK and US. “For UK banks, this leaves them time to either ‘do things properly’, or take their foot off the gas, expecting further delays down the line,” he said.\n\nUS bank bosses celebrated last year after the Fed cut in half the planned increase in capital requirements for the sector to 9 per cent, and was then unable to win necessary approval from other regulators even for this.\n\nMichael Barr, who oversaw the Basel Endgame proposals as vice-chair for supervision at the Fed, said this month he was stepping down from the role while remaining a governor, opening the door for a more business-friendly official to be appointed under Trump.",

    "body": "The price of travel permits needed by EU and US citizens to enter the UK is to rise from £10 to £16, the government said, triggering warnings that the cost will damage tourism.\n\nSince the electronic travel authorisation scheme took effect this month, many visitors to the UK who do not require a visa have to apply for digital permission to travel to the country.\n\nVisitors at present pay £10 for a permit that is valid for two years and allows them to take multiple journeys.\n\nBut the Home Office said the cost of a permit would rise from £10 to £16 to help “reduce the reliance of the migration and borders system on taxpayer funding”. The government department did not set a date for the changes, which it said would raise an additional £269mn a year.\n\nTourism groups and airlines criticised the changes, saying they made the cost of visiting the UK increasingly uncompetitive in light of EU plans to charge all visitors who do not need a visa €7 for its planned travel authorisation scheme.\n\nRichard Toomer, executive director of the Tourism Alliance trade association, said the decision to raise the charge was “staggering”.\n\n“This is especially a kick in the teeth for our European visitors just as they are required for the first time ever to apply for advance permission to travel to the UK,” he said.\n\nTourism is worth £74bn a year to the UK, and ministers in November announced a target to increase visitor numbers by nearly a third to 50mn people a year by 2030.\n\nBut Toomer said the target would be missed “if the government keeps viewing tourists simply as a cash cow”.\n\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of trade group Airlines UK, said the changes were “bitterly disappointing” but welcomed the Home Office’s decision to exempt transiting passengers who visit UK airports but do not enter the country.\n\nHeathrow airport had warned that its position as Europe’s leading hub airport was threatened by the decision to charge transfer passengers.\n\nVisitors from more than 50 countries including the US, Australia and Canada have needed to apply for one of the permits to enter the UK since the start of the scheme, which is loosely modelled on the US Esta programme.\n\nThe list will be expanded to include EU nationals on April 2, although Irish citizens will be exempt.\n\nEU and UK citizens have been caught in increased border formalities since frictionless travel disappeared with the implementation of the Brexit deal at the end of 2020, four years after the referendum.\n\nVisitors already face stringent passport checks at UK and EU borders, which have caused bouts of disruption for Eurostar and the Channel ports.\n\nUK citizens will also be caught up in new EU biometric border checks, which are due to be rolled out later this year but have been repeatedly delayed. A separate EU visa waiver programme, similar to the UK ETA, is also due to be rolled out in 2025.\n\nUnder the UK’s immigration price rises, the cost of other services including naturalisation as a British citizen will also rise.",

    "body": "To call Cob’s shopfront unassuming would be an understatement – but inside lies a Tardis of musical rarities. More than 15,000 second-hand vinyls, with a special focus on the 1960s to the 1980s, and over 6,500 CDs (remember those?). “If we can’t get it for you, nobody can,” is the motto – and it still holds true nearly 50 years after it was founded. Alexander Tyndall\n\nIt would be hard to pack more jazz records into this shop. It can feel a little overwhelming at times, especially trying to navigate the somewhat esoteric filing system. But there is plenty of used jazz gold (less so from more modern groups), and it’s possible to spend hours digging through choice cuts by Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus and more obscure artists. Richard Milne\n\nA quiet music sanctuary 10 minutes from Central Park, this store offers vintage records from acclaimed names such as Miles Davis to lesser-known jazz artists like Zoot Sims. Ask manager Bruce Eder for expert recommendations on its collection, which spans classical, jazz, soul, disco and more. Elena Losavio\n\nLocated next door to the historic Père Lachaise cemetery (the last resting place of musical greats like Édith Piaf, Chopin and Jim Morrison), Bar Italia specialises in new releases, second-hand records and Italian vinyl. Opened in 2023 by Sicilian-native Massimiliano Diliberto Paulsen, the shop is a haven from the tourist crowds and organises musical showcases while serving proper Italian coffees. Ben Marino\n\nThis store certainly lives up to its name: its basketball court-sized main room in the Swedish capital is crammed full of vinyl from just about every genre, a great collection of 7in singles, and plenty of other nostalgia from film posters to Dinky Toys. Next door, Trash Palace covers heavy metal and punk music. The records are decently priced, and alongside most of the classics, there is a decent sprinkling of rarities. I’ve picked up obscure Led Zeppelin live albums, Congolese soukous, and ’90s indie here. RM\n\nSounds of the Universe, which occupies a prime corner site in Soho, doubles as the HQ of Soul Jazz Records and stocks the label’s huge back catalogue of reissues and compilations. The shop is also a destination for DJs, with stock in a range of genres from reggae and jazz, through hip hop, Afrobeat and house, to Krautrock and the early 1980s New York avant-garde. Jonathan Derbyshire\n\nHidden down an alleyway opposite the splendour of Great Malvern Priory, Carnival Records is a great symbol of a slew of provincial record shops that have sprung up in recent years across the UK, offering friendly service and a decent spread of used and new vinyl, including boxsets. Carnival has a second room of cheaper vinyl for extra digging. RM\n\nA single bloodshot eye stares at the buses that stop outside the romanesque-style Queen Victoria Building shopping arcade inviting people down to one of the last bastions of Sydney’s once-thriving underground (literally) music scene. Red Eye Records has been operating since 1981 around town and has retained the feel of a traditionally chaotic music store. Its blood-red walls are plastered with heritage tour posters and expensive rarities. But unlike the new generation of vinyl-only music stores, the high-priced new vinyl releases, rarities and used oddities are still accompanied by racks of music books and CDs, which, the store says, still sell well to both young and old who can’t, or won’t, spend $80 on a new piece of vinyl. Nic Fildes\n\nThe shop belies its compact nature in a residential street to offer Copenhagen’s best vinyl experience. The selection of records is eclectic but does not aim for completeness. Instead, Tim Rose is one of the friendliest and chattiest record shop owners, and offers everything from Kiss and Björk to world music and even some vintage football tops. They offer a bigger selection online on Discogs too. RM\n\nI stumbled upon this store’s startling façade near Carnaby Street last summer. The store was bustling with fans of Jack White – the musician behind the shop and its eponymous label – who had just released his album. I walked in looking for No Name’s blues-punk tunes but stayed to explore a selection of live gigs recorded directly on vinyl, along with unissued music like Martin Solis’ rich Tejano sounds. EL\n\nThe Oxford branch of “Oxfordshire’s longest-running independent record store” on the Cowley Road attracts student hipsters and musos alike. It shares its space with the independent coffee shop Mostro, so you can get your flat white fix while browsing the new releases and tightly curated second-hand section. A small in-store stage showcases live performances by local talent. AT\n\nSituated in the heart of Kazimierz, this is one of a number of hip shops in the historic Jewish quarter of Kraków. Named after perhaps the Beastie Boys’ best record, the store offers a decent collection of Polish jazz – one of the best and most vibrant scenes on the continent – as well as jazz and hip hop. The staff are knowledgeable and helpful, even opening on a holiday for me to collect some records. RM\n\nCome for the comprehensive edit of contemporary indie, rock and dance records – stay for the 200 gigs a year the shop puts on, whether in its intimate onsite space, the Pryzm nightclub around the corner or St John’s Church on the outskirts of town. Tickets are not expensive and sometimes free when you buy an album. While many record stores rightly cherish the past, Banquet feels like it’s got its eye on the future. AT\n\nBudapest’s best record shop feels small, but is so well curated that there are hours of digging fun to be had. Everything from Hungarian prog music to techno and Indian raga is represented, and there’s a special selection of pressings from behind the old Iron Curtain. There is no turntable to listen to discs, but the staff will play your records on the main system. RM\n\nThis electronic music-focused store has been around in some form or another since the mid-1990s. It’s an absolute mainstay of the dance scene in the north of England. Breen Turner\n\nRun out of Portobello Road for a half century, Honest Jon’s has expanded to an excellent record label (home to the fabulous London Is The Place For Me compilations) as well as a wonderful but tiny second shop in Coal Drops Yard by King’s Cross. The shop majors in jazz, soul, and what it calls Outernational music that is well curated and always full of surprises. RM\n\nNot much is left of north-west London’s 1970s reggae scene, though in Harlesden there are two originals: Starlight Records and Hawkeye Enterprises. Neither is in mint condition, with Starlight reduced to a corridor by a money changers and Hawkeye an annexe to Caribbean bakery, but their place in Black British music history deserves respect. Bryce Elder\n\nThe Cotswold town of Stroud has no fewer than three great record shops – all arguably better than those in the bigger towns in Gloucestershire – and Klang Tone might be the best of them. Reflecting owner Sean Roe’s eclectic tastes from Japanese music and Afrobeat to far-out jazz and reggae, Klang Tone is well suited to finding discs you have never heard of and never knew you wanted. RM\n\nSituated in the nightlife-heavy inner suburb of Prahran is an institution; the shop has been on Greville Street since 1979 and has survived the downturns in vinyl, cassettes and CDs to thrive once again on vinyl. It was originally set up as an alternative to conservative music shops that did not stock overseas punk and metal records and has been around long enough to see those genres enter the mainstream. It now caters to pretty much any taste you care to name. The shop – which smells like old records – is gloriously crowded with crates, handwritten dividers and musical paraphernalia everywhere you turn. It is also a great place to spot local and touring musicians that swing by to catch up with the well-connected owner Warwick Brown. NF\n\nLisbon is a great place to find music from across the Lusophone world, and its flea markets have plenty of gems from Cabo Verde, Angola, Brazil, and Guinea-Bissau. The best record store though is Flur, home to plenty of discs, many of them local and inspired by the former Portuguese colonies. RM\n\nTucked away on the eighth floor of a nondescript office building in the West 20s in Manhattan, Jazz Records is a veritable Aladdin’s cave for jazz heads, with an immaculately curated range of both new and secondhand albums. The inaccessibility and vague air of secrecy just add to the allure. I spent $100 in there on a recent visit, but could easily have dropped a thousand. JD\n\nDown a side street off La Rambla, Barcelona City Records is one of Europe’s best shops to pick up Latin records. I recently filled my boots with fabulous pressings from Colombia’s legendary Discos Fuentes and some other 1960s cumbia discs. But there’s plenty else. RM\n\nVinyl Whistle, with its fully licensed cafe, DJ nights and live performances from established names such as former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler as well as up-and-coming local acts, fits in perfectly in Leeds’s vibrant Headingley. A city with a rich musical tradition, Leeds has produced famous names including indie rockers Kaiser Chiefs and soul singer Corinne Bailey Rae. The new and secondhand records at Vinyl Whistle offer a similar breadth of genres. Lukanyo Mnyanda\n\nAn institution – especially for keeping up with live music. You can really get a sense of how important live music is to Jumbo by how many gig listings are on the front page of their site, alongside the expected vinyl releases. They sell a little bit of everything and they’re very good at it. BT\n\nSince the demise of the much-missed Crocojazz on the Left Bank, this Haut Marais institution is just about the best place for serious jazz lovers to hunt for vinyl in Paris. You might also find yourself distracted here by the sumptuous selection of music from Francophone Africa and Latin and Lusophone America, as well as from countries across Europe. If anywhere’s going to have that album of cold war-era Czech library music you’ve been searching for, it’s Superfly. JD\n\nThorne Records, with its bright yellow exterior, is hard to miss among the specialty shops and restaurants in the fashionable Edinburgh neighbourhood of Bruntsfield. Customers – from local residents to university students to tourists – have access to a wide collection of “popular” music from the 1950s to the latest Taylor Swift. If you still cannot find what you are looking for, owner Mark Thorne will search far and wide, in line with his motto that every customer should leave happier than when they arrived. LM\n\nLocated just off Oslo’s main shopping drag and across the road from Norway’s parliament, it’s a cavernous store chock full of thousands of used vinyl (and CDs). Some of the rarer discs are at suitably Norwegian prices, but the rest is decently priced and there are plenty of rarities. RM\n\nIts founder having caught the revival and built a business selling vinyl online, Assai opened its first physical shop in a Dundee suburb in 2015 then moved into the city centre four years later. In-store performances by local bands and hard-to-find pressings, including an exclusive range with Japanese-style “obi” paper strips, have helped build its reputation as a tastemaker as well as a community hub. BE\n\nIt’s the brainchild of record dealers Xavier Ehretsmann and Vincent Privat; the duo met at a record fair and, in 2019, joined forces on their own bricks-and-mortar space – a cultural hub for kids and adults alike – near Paris’ Montmartre neighbourhood, followed by a second outpost in Marseille. Their selection is eclectic; from French boogie to folk and afro/cosmic beats, they also stock vintage books and posters, including a highly coveted collection of “rave flyers” from cities across the world. Inès Cross\n\nNew York may be over and the glory days long gone, but Academy Records is still hopping. Opened in the late 1970s, this warren of lightly used treasures offers a surprisingly broad catalogue of vinyl, DVDs and Blu-Rays. Not to mention the best selection of classical music in the city. For the most part, prices seem to be from another, better era, too. Matt Vella\n\nRough Trade renewed its central London presence last October, 17 years after it shut its basement store in Covent Garden. The Denmark Street store is much smaller than its flagship Brick Lane outlet, but offers a well curated selection of vinyl and CDs, and hosts gigs, book signings and listening parties. One suggestion for the independent chain though: Peter Watts’ recent book about the street’s pivotal role in the UK music industry would be a wise title to stock. Murray Withers\n\nWalking into Amoeba’s flagship in Berkeley requires passing under an enormous painted rainbow – a fitting entry onto hallowed ground. America’s largest (and best) independently owned record store is located at ground zero of the US free speech and anti-war movements, and the spirit of iconoclastic rebellion is alive and well inside. The huge selection of vinyl is priced to move and turns over daily so, even on a short timeframe, repeat visits are usually worth making. It also has locations in San Francisco and Los Angeles. MV\n\nIn the corner of Baytree Garden Centre, beside the owl sanctuary and a showroom of wood-burning stoves, are approximately a quarter of a million second-hand records. Uptown is intimidating. You’d need at least a day to get through the four rooms, which cover every genre and value, from one-off private pressings to bins of singles for 50p each. If you want it, Uptown probably has it, though good luck finding it. BE\n\nSound Station’s unassuming shopfront calls to mind the opposite of Salieri’s description of the Adagio movement from Mozart’s Serenade No 10. A rusty squeeze box this ain’t. Inside, you’ll find Denmark’s best-stocked record store with an enormous selection of rare and collectable vinyl. The new LP section is bountiful too. The chances of leaving the Station without something on your list are nearly nil. MV\n\nVisiting Jazzhole, a quaint little shop in the wealthy Ikoyi neighbourhood of Lagos, can sometimes feel like travelling back in time. Despite its being located on a busy thoroughfare, the world slows down inside as you become surrounded by an impressive collection of vinyls of Nigerian greats and African records. It doubles as a bookshop with a reliable supply of global and African literature classics and magazines from a different era. It’s an intimate space that serves as part café and part treasure trove. Aanu Adeoye\n\nMost record retailers favour order, with crates carefully arranged by label or genre and new releases displayed like trophies behind the counter. The Thing, a basement thrift store in Brooklyn, is chaos. Records are stacked on top of each other with careless abandon. Digging might turn up anything, though is sure to leave a layer of dust on your fingers. Social media fame means the stock is picked over for rarities these days, but the experience remains grimily authentic. BE\n\nCo-founded by the French-Taiwanese DJ Louise Chen with the aim of creating a welcoming and laidback space for music nerds, this airy 11th-arrondissement spot is one of the less intimidating record stores to visit. With a mix of second-hand and new records, and a mélange of genres, it regularly hosts listening parties and private collection sales with music insiders such as Desire Records founder Jérôme Mestre. It also has a hifi repair workshop on the same block. Ellie Pithers\n\nFounded in 1971, Digelius attained legendary status among Helsinki’s vinyl collectors before being taken over in 2023 by the successful local We Jazz label. That ensures that it covers the hip end of modern releases from both local and international artists, but there is a decent second-hand offering, particularly of jazz but also of classical and world music. RM\n\nA short walk from East Putney tube, this tiny shop, which used to be the location of the shop owner’s hairdresser, is packed full of soul and jazz records and CDs. Laurence Prangell, who started selling records with his brother Malcolm at record fairs in the late 1980s, opened the store in 1994 and quickly established a loyal following of vinyl collectors from around the world who come to him for rare issues of American funk and soul artists. Soul Brother also has a record label dedicated to re-issues, most famously a Marlena Shaw anthology. Gordon Smith",

    "body": "Good morning. Kemi Badenoch gave a big speech yesterday setting out where she thinks the UK is going wrong, how the government is failing and how she will change the Conservative party to win again.\n\nWell, after a fashion: Badenoch’s ability to set that definition is hamstrung by her self-denying ordinance not to set out policies.\n\nBadenoch is half-right that almost all policy proposals that she or the Conservative party make now will be redundant by the time of the next election.\n\nThat date could be almost as far in the future from today as the first reported case “of a pneumonia of an unknown type” in Wuhan is from the present. By the time of the next general election, Donald Trump’s second term as US president will either be over or nearing its end. No fewer than eight member states will have shuffled in and out of the rotating presidency of the EU in that time. An awful lot could happen between now and then.\n\nBut what she is missing is that well-chosen policies are part of how you signal your underlying principles. Let’s take the three shadow cabinet ministers who are, I think, doing the best job of signalling what they are about. They aren’t announcing policies but they are setting out a clear position: Laura Trott at shadow education is showing us that she thinks accountability and freedom are big drivers of how you improve public services. Robert Jenrick at shadow justice is showing that he favours authoritarian measures on law and order. And Claire Coutinho at shadow energy and net zero is showing that she will describe any measures to reach net zero, including ones she herself signed off, as pandering to “the climate change lobby”.\n\nThese are clear signals about where these shadow ministers would differ from the politicians they are opposing, where they want to fight the next election, and what about the last Conservative government they want to defend and what they want to disavow.\n\nBadenoch has been less clear: and one reason for that, I think, is she is simply not across the detail and sufficiently prepared to do the necessary legwork to be an effective leader of the opposition. Some thoughts on one example of that below.\n\nKemi Badenoch has a repeated argument about the British state and by extension about the Conservative record these past 14 years: that the UK state needs to focus on doing a little well, as opposed to a lot badly. (Or as she put it yesterday: “the government is already doing too much — and it’s doing it badly”.)\n\nShe also has an interesting argument about means-testing the winter fuel allowance, an idea that Whitehall officials presented to the Conservatives “time and again”. She criticised Rachel Reeves, saying the chancellor opted to do it because “she has no ideas of her own”. Means-testing the winter fuel allowance was a Conservative manifesto commitment in the 2017 election, it is the programme that Badenoch was first elected to parliament on. There is much that you can reasonably say both to criticise or to defend Theresa May and Nick Timothy, the authors of that manifesto, but I just don’t think “no ideas of their own” is a credible or serious one.\n\nMaybe — and I’m just spitballing here — maybe the reason why officials kept suggesting that the government means-test the winter fuel allowance and the reason why May wanted to do it in 2017 is also the reason why our new Labour government did it, which is that it is a reasonable suggestion.\n\nWhen Gordon Brown introduced the winter fuel allowance in 1997, pensioners were the poorest cohort in the UK. They are now the richest. It is also a benefit that has stayed the same in cash terms as it was in 2000, rather like the “Christmas bonus” that is paid to some benefit recipients and pensioners. This bonus was £10 when Edward Heath introduced it, was £10 when it was made permanent in 1979 and is £10 today. This is a really silly way to spend money! We are handing a benefit of diminishing value to an ever-wealthier group for no particular reason.\n\nIf you think that the British government does “too much”, you have to seriously engage with what it actually does, and much of what it does is provide services to older people. Now, I think that’s perfectly fine. As regular readers will know I don’t have much time for arguments about intergenerational unfairness when it comes to the provision of government services. Most of us cost a great deal from when we are born to when we leave compulsory education aged 18, and most of us will be net contributors to the public purse until the final decades of our life. This isn’t “intergenerational unfairness”: this is just fairness. Most of us over the age of 18 do not need more state provision and won’t until we are considerably older. If you want a lean and efficient state, it is hard to argue that a universal benefit introduced in 1997 is a non-negotiable part of it.\n\n(There is a different argument to be made about the housing market which I will return to in a later email.)\n\nNow here’s the Badenoch argument: the way that Reeves has done this, by pegging the point at which you receive the winter fuel allowance, means pensioners “on the breadline” are losing out. But that’s an argument for increasing the threshold for pension credit, not for a cash benefit of ever diminishing value to be paid out to more pensioners than receive pension credit.\n\nWhen Badenoch talks of means-testing, she seems to envisage some kind of perfect model with no edge cases, telling LBC’s Iain Dale that “means-testing is something we don’t do properly here”, that we “don’t have a system that knows who should get what”. That is to say, she thinks that the British state needs to spend more money in order to work out who it should give money to. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with this argument but if you claim that you want government to do less and you can’t even support this very simple reduction in a universal benefit, and if you want a yet more complex benefit system, you are not a serious small-state politician.\n\nBadenoch then went further, telling Dale that the Conservatives are also “looking at” means testing the “triple lock” pension, the same day that she had insisted that only a government with “no ideas” would means-test the winter fuel allowance.\n\nThe “triple lock pension” is a mechanism not a benefit. It is the solution that successive British governments since the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition have chosen to the problem that the UK state pension is not generous compared with its peers. As a mechanism it has downsides, not least that people start to see it as something that should go on forever and ever rather than a phased solution to a particular public policy problem.\n\nBut it’s not clear what it would even mean to “means-test” the process whereby we increase the size of the state pension by whichever is the highest out of 2.5 per cent, inflation, or earnings growth. The question of whether you means-test the state pension is not the same as how you ensure that the state pension provides a decent income for the people who need it.\n\nMeans-testing it does in theory allow you to be more generous to those who get it, but the reason why the Tories did not opt to do this is that doing so dissuades people from saving for their own retirement. I am not saying they were necessarily right to do so, but I’m struck that once again Badenoch’s grasp on what her government did and why it did it is not what one would hope.\n\nIf she wants to lead a government that is smaller and more efficient than either the last Conservative government or the present Labour one, she needs to engage much more deeply with what both those governments did and why.\n\n(Georgina writes:) I first read Sam Selvon’s The Lonely Londoners during my first months living away from home. The 1956 novel’s rhythms, prickly sensations and tragicomic shifts perfectly captured the feeling of being an “outsider” — showing the Windrush-era newcomers adjust to the city as individual Londoners, and not bundling them up into a narrowly defined immigrant group. “They only laughing because they fraid to cry” is one of my favourite lines.\n\nI didn’t know what to expect of the stage adaptation — and how it would respond to the book’s musicality and creolised English — but I was blown away. It’s on at the Kiln theatre until February 22.\n\nI also heartily recommend this BBC Free Thinking episode with some terrific guests reflecting on Selvon’s legacy in Caribbean and modernist literature.\n\nHowever you spend it, have a lovely weekend!",

    "body": "Last week was a terrible one for UK assets. Goldman’s portfolio strategy team put together this chart depicting quite how terrible it was, showing the quantum of the hit taken by a mix of UK stocks, gilts and currency.\n\nSure, the chart starts only in 2022, but oooof?\n\nThat the sell-off in UK bonds was part of a global bond move doesn’t help the total return of gilt holders. But we’re not here to spill more pixels on bonds. Louis has already done amazing work putting the relative yield moves of gilts — as well as the magnitude of the daily shifts in sterling — into historical context. But we thought it worth updating the FX-curious as to quite how weak the pound has become.\n\nAs we’ve written previously, it’s pretty easy to make a currency look weak or strong, depending on the point you’re trying to make. Keen to tell a story of sterling despair in an age of dollar strength? Cable is the answer! Perhaps a tale of sterling resilience during a period of euro weakness? Sterling-euro is your friend.\n\nIf you want a more sensible truly cross-rate agnostic measure you could look at the Broad Sterling Effective Exchange Rate series calculated each day by the Bank of England.\n\nUsing this measure we can see how sterling has tracked over the last quarter of a century. We’ve split it by prime ministers, and the big hits taken by sterling from the global financial crisis, the EU referendum, and Liz Truss all stand out. So far, the hit to sterling somewhat breathlessly reported by some of the media is less apparent.\n\nBut how many people really know what a broad effective exchange rate even is? Real, non-finance, people that is.\n\nLuckily, as keen readers will recall, our heuristic that sterling’s broad effective exchange rate can be proxied to a 60:40 mix of euros and dollars continues to deliver with stunningly high levels of confidence.\n\nAnd so we thought it a good moment to revive and update one of our favourite charts, first wheeled out in July 2023, to help answer the question as to how weak or strong sterling is in nice simple terms. The chart that maps sterling’s nominal value against both US dollars and euros, and only really works if you turn it on its side.\n\nAs a reminder, sterling moves to either the left or right along the horizontal lines of our rotated chart are manifestations of changes in EUR-USD rather than any strength or weakness of sterling per se.\n\nSure, this might mean sterling weakening (strengthening) against the US dollar (or euro) while strengthening (weakening) against the euro (or US dollar). But the broad effective exchange rate of sterling will remain pretty much unchanged.\n\nBy contrast, the (sort of) vertical lines on the rotated chart show where sterling crosses are for each given level of EUR-USD. Sterling can travel up or down any of these lines without the EUR-USD rate changing a basis point. Such vertical moves show genuine sterling strength (higher) or weakness (lower) in action.\n\nIn terms of levels, the latest reading is around 17 per cent weaker than the average rate under Blair, but around 7 per cent stronger than the average under May. It’s 4 per cent stronger than the average under Boris Johnson, and 2 per cent stronger than the average under Rishi Sunak. It would be callous to compare sterling values to those experienced during Truss’s brief tenure (9 per cent stronger).\n\nOf course, if last week’s move (around 1.5 per cent weaker) is just a taste of things to come this will soon not be true. But overall the impact of sterling moves so far look a bit . . . meh?",

    "blurb": "FTSE groups adopt practice criticised by lawmakers although research suggests it could lift long-term stock prices",
    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "British companies are buying back their shares at a faster rate than even US groups, adopting a practice that has drawn criticism for allegedly detracting from investment and innovation and come under fire from lawmakers in both countries.\n\nFTSE 100 companies made commitments to buy back at least £56.9bn of shares last year, according to investment platform AJ Bell, having pledged to repurchase more than £50bn of their stock in 2023 and 2022.\n\nAs a proportion of the market, 44 per cent of large companies in the UK reduced their share count by at least 1 per cent in 2024, pushing it ahead of the US, at 39 per cent, for the first time, according to calculations by fund firm Schroders using MSCI indices.\n\n“We seem to be going all guns blazing at the share buyback,” said Adrian Gosden, a UK equity income manager at Jupiter Asset Management in London.\n\nThe trend marks a shift in thinking among UK companies, which have historically favoured dividends as a way of returning money to shareholders, making the British market attractive to income investors.\n\nAt the end of October oil major Shell committed to another $3.5bn of share buybacks, taking its total last year to more than £10bn. In July, HSBC unveiled a $3bn buyback amid better than expected profits. British Gas owner Centrica in December said it would add £300mn to its existing buyback programme, bringing total planned repurchases to £1.5bn.\n\nIn a buyback, a company purchases its own shares in the market and then cancels them or holds them in storage, known as treasury. If it cancels them, this reduces the number of shares outstanding and therefore increases earnings per share.\n\nExecutives typically conduct buybacks if they believe there are no attractive acquisitions to be made or to signal that the stock is undervalued. Repurchases also tend to be more tax-efficient than dividends.\n\nThe value of dividends paid out by FTSE 100 companies grew steadily throughout the 2010s but had remained roughly flat since the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures from AJ Bell, as UK companies increasingly favour the flexibility of one-off buybacks.\n\n“Dividends are seen as a commitment,” said Alvin Chen, a researcher at the Stockholm School of Economics. Unexpectedly lowering a dividend “is seen by the market as a terrible thing”.\n\nEven a special dividend did not deliver the same advantages as a buyback because it did not send the same signal to the market that the company believed its shares were undervalued, Chen added.\n\nInvestors said the rise in UK buybacks could be linked to the comparatively low valuations of much of the London stock market, which has in recent years fallen behind many of its international peers. The FTSE 100 rose 5.7 per cent last year compared with the S&P’s 23.3 per cent rise. The UK benchmark is trading on a forward price/earnings ratio of 11.2 times earnings, against the US index’s 21.4 times, according to LSEG data.\n\nBuybacks also provide a way for UK companies to provide support to their share prices, helping counter years of investor outflows.\n\nBut some investors say buybacks simply deliver a short-term sugar high for earnings per share metrics used to calculate executive pay, rather than a sustainable boost to shareholder returns or an improvement in the company’s operating performance.\n\nAcademics say assessing whether a buyback will boost long-term shareholder value is complex and riddled with unknowns. For instance, they say, it is unclear if the money could have been better spent on research — for instance, inventing a new blockbuster product — or acquiring a competitor, raising staff pay or recruiting talent.\n\nNevertheless, most in-depth studies have found that, on average, groups that repurchase their own shares typically outperform those that do not. The S&P 500 Buyback index — an equal-weighted index of the 100 stocks in the US benchmark S&P 500 index that spend the highest share of their cash repurchasing their shares relative to their market capitalisation — has outperformed the broader S&P 500 Equal Weight index in 14 of the past 20 years, including in 2024.\n\nHowever, it was difficult to infer causality, according to Alice Bonaimé, an associate professor of finance at the University of Arizona. “Did the companies outperform the market because of the repurchase? Or were the outperformers the ones with extra cash on hand ready to be used in a repurchase programme?”\n\nAt a minimum, however, “it doesn’t look like repurchases destroy long-term shareholder value”, she said.\n\nAlberto Manconi, an associate professor of finance at Milan’s Bocconi University, has similarly found that buybacks “don’t hurt” long-term shareholders. His research, which compared the total returns of 9,000 companies between 1998 and 2010 following buyback announcements, found that repurchases were generally followed by “positive long-run excess returns”, with the greatest benefits accruing to “small, beaten-up, value stocks”.\n\nBut some lawmakers and academics say that rather than trying to boost share prices, companies should instead be spending excess cash on innovation or investment.\n\nPlane maker Boeing, which is struggling to turn around its finances, has come under fire for conducting about $44bn of buybacks between 2013 and 2019 rather than investing the money in improving its operations. It declined to comment on the criticism.\n\n“As this really extreme example of shareholder primacy, [buybacks] have this real harm of moving corporations away from investment,” said Lenore Palladino, an assistant professor of economics and public policy at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.\n\nGervais Williams, head of equities at Premier Miton Investors, said he did not “blame” companies buying back shares when valuations were low, “but that means they’re investing less in the community [and] in skilled employment”.\n\nAhead of November’s US election, President Joe Biden’s team proposed quadrupling the levy on buybacks it implemented in 2022 as part of efforts to make big corporations “pay their fair share”. Incoming president Donald Trump made no such campaign promises, although in 2020 he said he was “never happy” that companies were using excess cash to buy back their shares.\n\nThe UK’s Liberal Democrats last year called for a 4 per cent tax on buybacks, arguing that “instead of reinvesting their profits in skills, equipment or clean technology, many big corporations are just buying back shares to inflate their own share price”.\n\nOthers counter that there is little evidence that capital spent on buybacks will be redirected to investment in research, acquisitions, staff pay or expansion.\n\nFor the London market, the rise of buybacks showed it was becoming “more international”, particularly given that US investors “are more comfortable with buybacks”, said Charles Hall, head of research at UK broker Peel Hunt.\n\nIn 2022, a record 57.7 per cent of the value of the UK stock market was held by overseas investors, according to official data.\n\n“It also reflects the fact that UK companies, by historic standards, are very good value,” Hall said. “Given where valuations are [in the UK] at the moment, share buybacks look pretty sensible.”\n\nAdditional reporting by George Steer",

    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "As healthcare systems buckle under the weight of ageing populations, one area of care is forecast to have a lighter load: maternity units.\n\nThe global birth rate has plummeted since the 1950s, when women had an average of 4.7 children, to 2.3 births per woman today. If this trend continues, more than 23 nations are expected to see their populations halve by 2100.\n\nThe fall in fertility rates is most pronounced in developed nations: for example, the birth rate in England and Wales stands at 1.44 per woman, the lowest ever recorded — while populations are already shrinking in several OECD member states, including Japan, Italy and Greece, among others.\n\nBut what exactly is driving this steep decline? Research has historically shown a link between a mother’s education and birth rate — with highly educated women more likely to have fewer children, and to do so later in life. However, more recent studies by Oxford university have shown that fertility rates are now declining across all educational groups.\n\nOne reason for fewer births could also be the opportunity cost for mothers at work. Researchers have suggested that the “motherhood penalty” makes up more than 80 per cent of the gender pay gap — with the discrepancy between men and women only widening significantly when women hit their thirties and start having children.\n\nEconomic factors, such as the cost of raising a family, including childcare and housing costs, are also a factor. Rising housing costs in the UK now mean Gen Z faces twice as high costs as previous generations — while the average price of a nursery place for children under two years old is now £15,000 a year.\n\nIn addition to economic factors, changes in attitudes are also at play. Many millennials, or those born between 1981 and 1996, report feeling unprepared for parenthood, or not having found a suitable partner to have children with, as cited in research by the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies. The UCL report said that only one in four British millennials who say they want children are trying for them.\n\nSo, with so many factors at play, what do you think is the biggest cause for this decline?

For example, information on unclassified roads only gathered from local authorities on a voluntary four-yearly basis, despite accounting for 62 per cent of mileage on local highways.\n\n“Our inquiry shows government are having to find out about these issues from industry bodies and road users themselves due to their own patchy data,” the committee said.\n\nSince 2020-21, the department has provided local authorities with funding from the Potholes Fund — one of twelve funds allocated to local authorities for maintenance — which is expected to total £2.2bn by the end of 2024-25.\n\nAlongside a one-off top-up in 2023-24, specific pothole funding from the department represented 40 per cent of capital funding to local authorities in that year.\n\nAn additional £500mn for road maintenance, aiming to fix a further one million pot holes across England was announced in the autumn Budget.\n\nAccording to the Road Haulage Association, planned works cost an average of 35 per cent less than reactive repairs in England, the report said.\n\nThe RHA added that short-term maintenance, including temporarily fixing potholes, had caused money to be “wasted”.\n\nThe report found there were also continuing problems with infrastructure projects, reporting an increase in delays as well as falling out of the scope of their budgets.\n\nThe Department for Transport said: “For far too long our roads have been left to crumble, and this report has laid bare the result of the decades of decline we have inherited in our road infrastructure.\n\n“That’s why we’re investing a record £1.6 billion for the coming year to help local authorities fix up to seven million more potholes.\n\n“Road users are rightly frustrated by patchwork repairs, so we are also committed to multiyear funding settlements to enable councils to better maintain their road networks and avoid potholes forming in the first place.”\n\nAdam Hug from the Local Government Association said: “Greater, long-term funding certainty for local highways authorities — with five yearly funding allocations on a par with national highways — is needed to tackle the multibillion pound local roads backlog.”\n\n“This will enable councils to far more effectively plan for and invest in preventive treatments, which keep surfaces in better condition for longer.\n\nThe MPs’ report came the day after new figures showed that only a small fraction of the UK’s national infrastructure projects are on time and within budget.\n\nThe Infrastructure Projects Authority, which oversees the progress of major schemes for the government, said on Thursday that the number of projects rated “red” for risk in 2023-24 had increased.\n\nOnly 25 green-rated projects, or just over one in ten, were deemed “highly likely” to be delivered on time and on budget.\n\nIt said that successful delivery currently “appears to be unachievable” for £97bn of major schemes, many of them IT projects and key defence programmes such as the replacement of the Typhoon fighter jet.\n\nThree immigration projects were also rated red, including the rebuilding of the Manston detention centre and the creation of a new end-to-end immigration system, as well as the remaining phase of HS2.",
