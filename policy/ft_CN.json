    "body": "The CIA’s claim that the Covid-19 virus probably emerged from a Chinese laboratory leak has revived a fierce five-year battle over the pandemic’s origins.\n\nSeveral US agencies and some scientists have proposed the lab leak theory over the past few years. But other experts insist there are good reasons to think the devastating pathogen emerged from a market where animals are traded.\n\nBeijing has never fully co-operated with international investigators, impeding the search for a definitive answer. But scientists continue their quest to establish the causes of a global health crisis that killed millions of people, caused trillions of dollars of economic damage and increased fears over the risks of virus research.\n\nThe CIA said on Saturday that the Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus was “more likely” to have a “research-related” origin than a natural one.\n\nBut the CIA said it had “low confidence” in its conclusion, which came after its new director John Ratcliffe took office and urged the agency to “get off the sidelines” in its analysis of the pathogen’s origins. Its assessment gave no indications of having drawn on new intelligence and was the product of a review ordered by the Biden administration near the end of its time in office.\n\nThe CIA’s statement is the latest from US politicians and agencies that lean towards the lab leak theory. Some Republican lawmakers have used the hypothesis as part of a broader critique of China’s handling of the outbreak. Beijing has denied that either the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a leading centre for coronavirus research, or the Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control were the initial virus source.\n\nAsked about the CIA statement this week, China’s foreign ministry said the US should “stop politicising and weaponising origins-tracing”.\n\nMany authorities internationally have yet to take a strong position on Covid’s origins, while stressing that they back World Health Organization efforts to establish it. The UK’s health ministry said a “robust, transparent and science-led review” would “better prevent” future pandemics.\n\nThe WHO’s relations with Beijing deteriorated when Chinese officials did not allow the health body to probe Covid’s origins thoroughly. This month the organisation said it was a “moral and scientific imperative” for China to offer the necessary data and access.\n\nIts advocates believe that if a potent new coronavirus appears in a city that was a centre for research into such pathogens, then a lab was probably the origin.\n\nThe Wuhan institute’s work reflected a growing focus on the threat posed by diseases of animal origin. Such zoonotic coronaviruses are thought to have caused the Sars and Mers outbreaks in 2002 and 2012. The institute sometimes worked with US partners on US government-funded projects, such as 2015 “gain-of-function” experiments that made coronaviruses deadlier for research purposes.\n\nThe lab leak idea has spawned various sub-theories. One is that Sars-Cov-2 was being investigated by researchers having been gathered from a bat or other wild animal. Another is that the pathogen was created by modifying a natural coronavirus. This could have been done either by a process of artificially accelerated evolution known as serial passaging, or by genetic engineering.\n\nProponents of the lab leak hypothesis acknowledge the lack of supporting proof but argue this is impossible to gather without Chinese co-operation.\n\n“There is not a smoking gun, but there’s a gun laying on the table and it’s warm to the touch,” said Jamie Metzl, a former member of a WHO advisory committee on genome editing. “There is all of this circumstantial evidence.”\n\nMany scientists still favour a scenario that Covid, like other coronaviruses, emerged in animals and then passed to humans. According to this model, the likely starting point was contact between wild creatures and humans in a Wuhan wet market where early Covid cases were identified.\n\nThe theory found support in research published last year on environmental samples taken from Huanan Seafood Market in the central Chinese city in January 2020. It pinpointed a stall where all the Sars-Cov-2 positive swabs contained traces of wildlife DNA too, showing both animals and virus were present at the same location. The samples included genetic material from species such as raccoon dogs, civets and bamboo rats. All these creatures had been identified as possible sources of virus transmission to humans.\n\n“Multiple plausible intermediate hosts of Sars-Cov-2 were present at the exact site within Wuhan to which Covid-19 was first epidemiologically linked,” the researchers wrote.\n\nCritics allege the market origin theory is flawed. They say it gives too little weight to reports of human Covid cases as early as November 2019. The market hypothesis also includes the contested suggestion that there were at least two separate spillover events there from animals to humans, helping seed an epidemic.\n\nThe scientists behind last year’s study say neither of these points undermines the idea that the market was the source of Covid. They contend that Sars-Cov-2 genetic material in the January 2020 samples could have been deposited weeks before, consistent with the reports of Covid cases in November 2019. Professor Florence Débarre, an evolutionary biologist and co-author of the research, said a market origin was “likely whether or not there were multiple spillovers”.\n\nThe CIA had not provided corroborating information for its lab leak assessment, Débarre noted, adding: “I hope that the data and logic leading to the conclusion of the various elements of the US intelligence community will one day be made public.”\n\nGain of function research involves manipulating pathogens to probe their behaviour by enhancing properties such as transmissibility and ability to cause disease. The work may be done for valid reasons such as development of vaccines or other ways to combat emerging pathogens.\n\nBut the rules governing its research remain patchy, with no international governance regime in place.\n\nLast year the US government tightened rules on gain of function research. Some experts argue the revised rules, which were weakened from an initial plan that some scientists warned could hobble work on less hazardous pathogens, have troubling gaps.\n\nThe focus on federally funded research pays insufficient attention to non-federally financed work and experiments on novel pathogens, said Alina Chan, a viral vector engineer at MIT and Harvard’s Broad Institute.\n\n“The prediction of pandemic risk arising from novel experiments is difficult even for multidisciplinary teams of experts, and a self-reporting system is inadequate as evidenced by past incidents,” Chan wrote in a paper published last month.\n\nUS politicians such as Senator Rand Paul have long called for closer scrutiny of gain of function research. The debate, like that over Covid’s origins, will remain hotly contested for years to come.",

    "blurb": "Complex will be bigger than Pentagon and include bombproof bunkers for leaders, say US officials",
    "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s military is building a massive complex in western Beijing that US intelligence believes will serve as a wartime command centre far larger than the Pentagon, according to current and former American officials.\n\nSatellite images obtained by the Financial Times that are being examined by US intelligence show a roughly 1,500-acre construction site 30km south-west of Beijing with deep holes that military experts assess will house large, hardened bunkers to protect Chinese military leaders during any conflict — including potentially a nuclear war.\n\nSeveral current and former US officials said the intelligence community was closely monitoring the site, which would be the world’s largest military command centre — and at least 10 times the size of the Pentagon.\n\nBased on an assessment of satellite images obtained by the FT, major construction started in mid-2024. Three people familiar with the situation said some intelligence analysts had dubbed the project “Beijing Military City”.\n\nThe construction comes as the People’s Liberation Army develops new weapons and projects ahead of the force’s centenary in 2027. US intelligence said President Xi Jinping had also ordered the PLA to have developed the capability to attack Taiwan by then.\n\nThe PLA is also rapidly expanding its nuclear weapons arsenal and working to better integrate its different branches. Military experts believe the PLA’s lack of integration is among its biggest weaknesses compared with the US armed forces.\n\n“If confirmed, this new advanced underground command bunker for the military leadership, including President Xi as the chairman of the Central Military Commission, signals Beijing’s intent to build not only a world-class conventional force but also an advanced nuclear warfighting capability,” said Dennis Wilder, the former head of China analysis for the CIA.\n\nThe Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the US intelligence community, did not comment on the project. The Chinese embassy in Washington said it was “not aware of the details” but stressed that China was “committed to the path of peaceful development and a defence policy that is defensive in nature”.\n\nRenny Babiarz, a former imagery analyst at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency who has analysed imagery of the area, said there were at least 100 cranes working over a 5 sq km area developing underground infrastructure.\n\n“Imagery analysis suggests the construction of several possible underground facilities linked via possible underground passageways, although additional data and information is needed to more fully assess this construction,” said Babiarz, now vice-president of analysis and operations at AllSource Analysis, a geospatial analysis service group.\n\nThe site was busy with construction activity earlier this month, in contrast to a dearth of development in most big real estate projects in China, which has been gripped by a property sector crisis. There were no showrooms typically associated with a commercial real estate project. Unusually for a commercial project, there are no official mentions of the construction site on the internet in Chinese.\n\nWhile there was no visible military presence at the site, there were signs warning against flying drones or taking photographs. Guards at one gate abruptly said that entry was prohibited and refused to talk about the project. One supervisor leaving the construction site refused to comment on the project.\n\nAccess to the back of the project has been blocked by a checkpoint. A guard said the public could not access popular hiking and tourist areas near the site, which a local shopkeeper described as a “military area”.\n\nOne former senior US intelligence official said that while the PLA’s current headquarters in central Beijing was fairly new it was not designed to be a secure combat command centre.\n\n“China’s main secure command centre is in the Western Hills, north-east of the new facility, and was built decades ago at the height of the cold war,” said the former official. “The size, scale and partially buried characteristics of the new facility suggest it will replace the Western Hills complex as the primary wartime command facility.\n\n“Chinese leaders may judge that the new facility will enable greater security against US ‘bunker buster’ munitions, and even against nuclear weapons,” the former intelligence official added. “It can also incorporate more advanced and secure communications and have room for expanding PLA capabilities and missions.”\n\nOne China researcher familiar with the images said the site had “all the hallmarks of a sensitive military facility”, including heavily reinforced concrete and deep underground tunnelling.\n\n“Nearly 10 times bigger than the Pentagon, it’s fitting for Xi Jinping’s ambitions to surpass the US,” said the researcher. “This fortress only serves one purpose, which is to act as a doomsday bunker for China’s increasingly sophisticated and capable military.”\n\nThe construction of the site comes amid a multi-year redevelopment of Beijing’s western outskirts. But there has been speculation online in China about why houses in the Qinglonghu area were being razed.\n\nIn one post on Baidu Zhidao, the Chinese search engine’s equivalent of Quora, one user said: “Are they going to build the Chinese Pentagon in Qinglonghu?”\n\nTwo people close to Taiwan’s defence ministry also said the PLA appeared to be building a new command centre, though some experts questioned if the area was suitable for underground bunkers.\n\n“The land area is much larger than a normal military camp and military school, so it can only be assumed that it is a site for an administrative organisation or a large training base,” said Hsu Yen-chi, a researcher at the Council on Strategic and Wargaming Studies think-tank in Taipei.",

    "body": "OpenAI says it has found evidence that Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek used the US company’s proprietary models to train its own open-source competitor, as concerns grow over a potential breach of intellectual property.\n\nThe San Francisco-based ChatGPT maker told the Financial Times it had seen some evidence of “distillation”, which it suspects to be from DeepSeek.\n\nThe technique is used by developers to obtain better performance on smaller models by using outputs from larger, more capable ones, allowing them to achieve similar results on specific tasks at a much lower cost.\n\nDistillation is a common practice in the industry but the concern was that DeepSeek may be doing it to build its own rival model, which is a breach of OpenAI’s terms of service.\n\n“The issue is when you [take it out of the platform and] are doing it to create your own model for your own purposes,” said one person close to OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment further or provide details of its evidence. Its terms of service state users cannot “copy” any of its services or “use output to develop models that compete with OpenAI”.\n\nDeepSeek’s release of its R1 reasoning model has surprised markets, as well as investors and technology companies in Silicon Valley. Its built-on-a-shoestring models have attained high rankings and comparable results to leading US models.\n\nShares in Nvidia fell 17 per cent on Monday, wiping $589bn off its market value, on fears that big investments in its expensive AI hardware might not be needed. They recovered by 9 per cent on Tuesday, along with other tech stocks.\n\nOpenAI and its partner Microsoft investigated accounts believed to be DeepSeek’s last year that were using OpenAI’s application programming interface (API) and blocked their access on suspicion of distillation that violated the terms of service, another person with direct knowledge said. These investigations were first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this detail. DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment made during the lunar new year holiday.\n\nEarlier, President Donald Trump’s AI and crypto tsar David Sacks said “it is possible” that IP theft had occurred.\n\n“There’s a technique in AI called distillation . . . when one model learns from another model [and] kind of sucks the knowledge out of the parent model,” Sacks told Fox News on Tuesday.\n\n“And there’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI models, and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this,” Sacks added, although he did not provide evidence.\n\nDeepSeek said it used just 2,048 Nvidia H800 graphics cards and spent $5.6mn to train its V3 model with 671bn parameters, a fraction of what OpenAI and Google spent to train comparably sized models. Some experts said the model generated responses that indicated it had been trained on outputs from OpenAI’s GPT-4, which would violate its terms of service.\n\nIndustry insiders say that it is common practice for AI labs in China and the US to use outputs from companies such as OpenAI, which have invested in hiring people to teach their models how to produce responses that sound more human. This is expensive and labour-intensive, and smaller players often piggyback off this work, say the insiders.\n\n“It is a very common practice for start-ups and academics to use outputs from human-aligned commercial LLMs, like ChatGPT, to train another model,” said Ritwik Gupta, a PhD candidate in AI at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n“That means you get this human feedback step for free. It is not surprising to me that DeepSeek supposedly would be doing the same. If they were, stopping this practice precisely may be difficult,” he added.\n\nThe practice highlights the difficulty for companies keen to protect their technical edge. “We know [China]-based companies — and others — are constantly trying to distil the models of leading US AI companies,” OpenAI said in its latest statement.\n\nIt added: “We engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models, and believe . . . it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.”\n\nOpenAI is battling allegations of its own copyright infringement from newspapers and content creators, including lawsuits from The New York Times and prominent authors, who accuse the company of training its models on their articles and books without permission.",

    "blurb": "Entities loaned billions to create mining and processing supply chain, report shows",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "China has built up control of critical minerals across the developing world over the course of two decades through a network of at least 26 state-backed financial institutions, according to a new report that traces the country’s financing strategy.\n\nResearch published on Wednesday found that Chinese policy and commercial banks — working alongside private Chinese entities and some non-Chinese groups — issued loans worth nearly $57bn from 2000 to 2021 in 19 low- and middle-income countries for mining and processing copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium and rare earths, components critical to clean energy technologies such as electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.\n\nThe study by AidData at the College of William & Mary in the US, which was reviewed by the Financial Times, attempts to capture the extent of China’s financing of extractive projects in the developing world. The research highlights the scale of the challenge faced by the west in countering China’s control of the global supply chain for emerging green-tech industries.\n\n“Given that China’s financing model enables its companies to outmanoeuvre competitors in capital-intensive mineral sectors, its rivals need to develop more compelling and competitive financing arrangements that are responsive to the preferences of host countries,” said Brooke Escobar, who leads AidData’s Chinese development finance programme.\n\nThe research shows that more than three-quarters of China’s state-backed transition mineral financing — via both debt and equity — in the developing world was channelled to projects where Chinese entities held ownership stakes in joint ventures and special purpose vehicles.\n\nThese entities have long-term control over the extraction and processing of strategic mineral deposits, including copper from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru as well as Indonesia’s nickel and Argentina’s lithium reserves.\n\nThe data was compiled from the loan recipients and is rarely disclosed by Chinese financial institutions.\n\nChina’s transition minerals financing differs from Beijing’s traditional lending practices in the infrastructure-focused Belt and Road Initiative, one of President Xi Jinping’s hallmark foreign development policies, the AidData researchers argued.\n\nUnlike most loans made for BRI projects, which are dominated by a handful of Chinese development banks, the network of lenders to the mineral sector was much broader.\n\nBeijing’s state-owned commercial banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Citic, play the largest role.\n\nHowever, a much larger network of 86 entities, including 26 Chinese official sector entities as well as scores of private Chinese companies and some non-Chinese financiers, also provided financing alongside Chinese state-backed participants in syndicated loans. This represents a much more diversified creditor base than traditional BRI lending.\n\nICBC, BoC and Citic did not respond to requests for comment on the data, nor did seven other large Chinese banks contacted by the FT.\n\nThe minerals lending also mostly involved serial lending, rather than one-off loans, in contrast to the BRI. State lenders initially provided an acquisition loan to help a Chinese company gain an ownership stake in a mine, before further credit facilities were extended for development and to provide working capital.\n\nThe BRI has also been marred by the issue of low-income countries struggling to repay hundreds of billions of dollars and allegations of “debt trap diplomacy” after a spate of sovereign debt defaults.\n\nBut AidData showed that about one-quarter of China’s mineral lending was backed by a Chinese guarantor, compared with an estimated 4 per cent in Beijing’s broader overseas lending portfolio, reflecting an increased emphasis on risk mitigation and safeguarding investment returns.\n\nThe lending was mostly targeted at upstream resource extraction, AidData said. This helped secure China’s access to raw materials, creating a vertically integrated Chinese-controlled supply chain, while avoiding competing with its own domestic mineral processing industry.\n\nThe data showed that two-thirds of the financing went into JVs or SPVs where the host government held no significant level of ownership. Bypassing local governments reduced those countries’ financial liabilities but also potentially limited their access to future financial returns, the researchers noted.\n\nChina’s dominance in many cleantech sectors is expected to expand over the next 10 years, forecasts suggested, despite the US and Europe handing out hundreds of billions of dollars in industrial subsidies as well as rising protectionism via tariffs and bans on Chinese-made products.",

    "body": "Chinese artificial intelligence groups have been rushing out model updates before the lunar new year holiday, as the world wakes up to the sector’s major advances led by start-up DeepSeek in the face of US chip restrictions.\n\nOn Monday, the eve of China’s most important annual holiday, the Hangzhou-based company released a new open-source model for image generation, cementing its reputation as the disrupter-in-chief in a field previously dominated by US giants. It came hot on the heels of model releases from tech giant Alibaba and start-ups Moonshot and Zhipu.\n\n“This is the equivalent of dropping a massive release on Christmas Eve. We’ve all been working overtime to get stuff out before the holiday,” said one product manager at a large language model start-up.\n\nWhile DeepSeek’s achievement has prompted panic in the US about the advances Chinese labs are making on bootstrapped budgets, industry insiders say it is feeding into a newfound “confidence” in China that will spur investment.\n\n“DeepSeek has made faster progress than the other Chinese model companies. But this is giving them confidence that they can catch up,” said one AI investor in China.\n\nDeepSeek has captured the world’s attention with a series of model releases that show similar performance to those of US rivals such as OpenAI and Meta, even though it claims to have a fraction of the computing resources and is blocked from acquiring the latest Nvidia processors by US export restrictions. Last week, it released its R1 reasoning model, an advanced model that rivals OpenAI’s o1 and can automatically learn and improve itself without human supervision.\n\n“DeepSeek has injected a lot of energy into China’s AI players and, more broadly, into the global open-source AI community that will use its findings from its R1 paper to make progress on reasoning models,” said Wang Tiezhen, an engineer at AI research hub Hugging Face.\n\nThis week, investors dumped AI-related stocks, with Nvidia losing almost $600bn in market value on Monday. They were reacting to Chinese breakthroughs that show it is possible to build powerful models while pursuing a different strategy to the US one of building ever-larger computing clusters to get ahead in the AI race.\n\nOn Monday, Alibaba’s Qwen released Qwen2.5-1M, a series of new models that are capable of handling longer inputs, an important development that would mean the model could be deployed for AI agent applications with higher memory demands, according to Wang.\n\nOn the same day, DeepSeek released Janus-Pro, a text-to-image generation model that it claims can surpass state of the art ones from competitors such as OpenAI’s Dall-E 3 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion 3 on some benchmarks.\n\nZhipu, valued at its last funding round in December at $3bn, last week released an update to GLM-PC. The AI agent model is aimed at enterprise customers, enabling computers to automatically complete tasks such as filling out forms or digesting financial reports.\n\nWhile Zhipu has not courted much attention for its LLM development, it has a lead among local AI start-ups in commercialising its technology, with support from local governments and state-owned enterprises that have partnered with the Beijing-based company to deploy its models.\n\nLast week, another Beijing-based start-up Moonshot, which owns the popular AI chatbot Kimi, updated its reasoning model to Kimi k1.5, demonstrating strong results compared with established AI models for complex reasoning tasks. The latest release can process texts and images while handling long and complex queries.\n\nIt is standard practice for Chinese tech companies to release products before the long holiday, with the added benefit that potential customers with lots of free time during the break can test and explore them.\n\nOnce Chinese AI players return from their break, the race is on to become the leading player developing AI applications for commercial use. “If AI agents can create dramatic commercial value, one or two of the LLM players have a chance to transform into a new generation of software companies,” the AI investor said.",

    "body": "It was autumn, and Emma and her husband Alan were not expecting their baby for another six months. But beds at the YueGe post-partum confinement centre filled up quickly. The room wasn’t cheap, at Rmb150,000, or about $21,000, for 28 days. But unlike a normal hotel, it came with its own team of professional nurses and nannies. They would observe the new mother and her baby during the day and help with feeds at night. Twice a week, a doctor would check on the mother’s recovery. Meals would be tailored to her needs. At such a life-changing moment, there would be nothing for the new parents to worry about.\n\nEmma and Alan had looked at several centres in Shanghai, but YueGe’s stood out. Online reviews raved, saying even the staff were well treated. They’d spoken to a manager, Wang, for two hours and been impressed. It helped that his boss, Liang, was from Taiwan, where the tradition of confinement had first emerged as a modern industry.\n\nEmma is 34 and works in finance. Her friends were “all doing it” too, but that wasn’t the reason she found the idea of confinement so attractive. Nor had she immediately thought about the health benefits of the ancient practice, such as the need to avoid the cold of the wind entering your bones (a risk even at the height of summer). It was just appealing, the thought of having so many people to look after you. Plus, if she stayed at home, as her parents’ generation did, the excited new grandparents would end up moving into the couple’s two-bedroom apartment. They would “interfere”, and there would be all kinds of family conflict. No, in the confinement centre, she would be in charge.\n\nIn return for a discount, Emma and Alan agreed to pay upfront. At YueGe, the care was so attentive that a chat group was set up just for them, with seven or eight members of staff in it. The couple also attended three lectures at the site. But one Sunday in March, just two months before their baby was due, they received a strange message.\n\nPurportedly sent by staff at the centre, the message explained in vague language that YueGe had undergone “structural changes” that were “beyond the authority and scope of the staff”. It went on to say the staff’s own wages were also in arrears, and they would take legal action. The message added that any other questions would need to be directed towards the managers Wang and Liang, who were copied in. It also listed another company: Beikang.\n\nAlan and Emma didn’t know what had happened, but the implication was clear: YueGe had run out of money, including their advance payment, and there would be no month of confinement.\n\nEmma’s first response was to go on to the internet, where she now came across rumblings of discontent about the centre. She also found a QR code of the kind that is common in China. It allowed the couple to enter into a WeChat weiquanqun, or “group for the protection of rights”. It was already full of other parents-to-be. “We realised,” says Alan, “that this was a very serious matter.”\n\nThe concept of “rights protection” has its roots, including a sense of powerlessness in the courts, in the legal code that emerged in China following the end of strict communism in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, it is most associated with the risks facing consumers who experience gyms closing midway through their contracts or property investment schemes going awry. While many see no option but to show up at the doors of the business itself seeking redress, social media has given aggrieved consumers somewhere to organise themselves.\n\nEveryone in the newly created chat group had received the same vague text message, naming the two managers of YueGe. Wang was the manager who had met Alan and Emma. Liang’s Taiwanese nationality was, as one of few salient facts available, a focus for suspicion. “We need to stop Liang from fleeing to Taiwan,” wrote one user, echoing a widely held concern in mainland China over insiders absconding with company funds. But if that did happen, said another user, all might not be lost: “They hold people accountable [there], more than we can in the mainland.”\n\nSome scrutinised the timing of the discounts people had been offered. “Mr Liang urged us to pay on November 26, and his WeChat moments stopped updating on November 28,” wrote one user. More messages emerged, indicating that in February, further discounts had been offered in return for full payment upfront, seemingly to plug some kind of cash shortage. “The Taiwanese guy called me and said the same thing, full payment before the Lantern festival.” “Premeditated,” said another user, in the absence of any other explanations. (The FT was unable to contact either Liang or Wang.)\n\nEmma and Alan were content to quietly observe the discussion in the WeChat group, not wanting to draw attention to themselves. Besides, it was almost impossible to be sure who was sharing information. Despite the participants being Chinese, most of their usernames were in English or interspersed with emojis — not unusual in an internet environment where people often seek to obscure their identity.\n\nThe question of who could help was similarly unclear. One user had gone to the China Consumers Association, but it told him to contact the Health Bureau which, it claimed, regulated post-partum confinement centres. “Are there any friends here who understand the law?” he asked in bewilderment. Another claimed to be at a police station, where officers said that they could not file a case. Instead the advice was to go to the head office of the relevant company.\n\nIn the absence of clear identities, people were mainly distinguished by how much noise they made. The most prominent voice belonged to a user whose name included a bee emoji, and who claimed to “specialise in complaints”. When it came to the art of protecting rights, she was a natural, recalled Alan. She too had contacted the police, who told her this was a contract dispute, and nothing to do with them.\n\n“The first thing the policeman said to me,” she wrote on the Sunday the group was formed, was: “Are you just one person, or are there a lot of you?” “It was then that I understood,” she continued, “that as just one person, he didn’t care at all.”\n\nBut with around 100 people now claiming to be victims, there was growing hope of recovery. Bee emoji suggested the group find a time to report the incident together. “If you aren’t getting your money,” she told them, “it’s because you aren’t making enough noise.”\n\nDespite their widespread confidence in the Taiwan theory, by Monday, the group’s focus had begun to shift to the other company named in the original message, Beikang, which they mostly referred to as Saint Bella, the brand name for which it is best known. The company, launched by 38-year-old entrepreneur Xiang Hua in 2017, describes itself as “a family care group with a leading post-partum care and recovery operation”, and in 2023 had revenues of Rmb560mn, the second biggest from post-partum centres in China that year. Last year, it launched an IPO application in Hong Kong.\n\nThe company has a network of 72 “premium post-partum centers”, including one in Los Angeles which opened last year. It has also made a series of acquisitions. In December 2022, it carried out due diligence on the parent company of YueGe, called YueZiGe (a play on the Chinese word for confinement). The purchase of YueZiGe went through in February 2024, just a month before Emma and Alan received the news about their confinement centre.\n\nFor those who still had no idea what had happened to their money, Saint Bella now seemed to offer the best hope of compensation. Some in the group focused on the company’s indirect ownership stake in YueGe. Its potential vulnerability to negative publicity was also weighed, given the impending IPO. (One user referred to a complaints page on the Hong Kong stock exchange, another suggested exposing those responsible on a nationwide TV gala held on world consumer rights day.) Further suspicion was aroused when it was noted that online posts mentioning the company in relation to the scandal had been “harmonised” — a euphemism in China for deleted online content.\n\nMeanwhile, members of the group were increasingly heading to confinement sites in person in the hope of finding and confronting responsible parties. That Monday evening, one user claimed to be at the YueGe site where Alan and Emma first visited. “Boss Wang and Boss Liang are here,” she wrote, and Saint Bella was on its way.\n\nAt 6.04pm, another user posted a livestream link from the site on Xiaohongshu, a social media platform with over 300 million users, to the group. In an environment used to highly sophisticated online censorship, what happened next still sowed confusion.\n\n“Has the stream finished?” someone asked a quarter of an hour later, at 6.20pm. “It’s been taken down,” another replied.\n\nThe link was posted twice more, at 6.23pm and 6.31pm. On both occasions it lasted only a few minutes before apparently being taken down.\n\nAt 6.34pm, the link was posted one final time. Five minutes later another user posted: “It’s been turned off?”\n\nFor those watching, any hope of finding answers live from the confinement site had been frustrated. But Emma and Alan were beginning to notice something strange. The people who made the most noise soon became very quiet, and those who went to the sites “didn’t tell us anything” after they came back.\n\nBy Tuesday, with few other options available, Emma decided the only possible course of action left was to make a scene of her own. In another “rights protection” WeChat group she had joined, she proposed heading to the same confinement site with red protest banners with white characters, in the style of those used to display government slogans. Within two hours, as though someone was watching closely, her phone rang. It was Saint Bella, with a simple message:\n\n“Let’s talk.”\n\nThe office building where they met Saint Bella near Shanghai’s Nanjing West Road looked rundown, said Alan. “You simply couldn’t believe it’s the same company if you compare it with the post-partum centres.”\n\nFrom the start, 48 hours earlier, his reaction to the entire affair had been to comfort his pregnant wife, and to avoid showing too much emotion. That Tuesday morning, before they were invited to the meeting, he had been to the police station on his own. As expected, he found no legal solution. But he had encountered some other parents-to-be there, some of whom said they had negotiated a deal with Saint Bella, and he was afraid of missing out.\n\nOn the WeChat group there were also rumours that some, after protesting on site, had received an offer of a 40 per cent refund, a free nanny during their confinement month at home, and meal delivery. Others suggested there was another choice: discounts on rooms in other centres that the company ran in Shanghai, if they were willing to pay again. The claims attracted suspicion. One user deployed the term shui jun, referring to someone who is paid to post online, in response to a user who linked to an article about compensation.\n\nWord of behind-the-scenes offers also exposed a disunity among the largely anonymous group. Saint Bella is “crossing the river by feeling each stone”, posted someone, referring to a famous quote from former leader of China, Deng Xiaoping. “It is dealing with you one by one, defeating you one by one, so that you will not gather together or post on social media.” “Something I just don’t understand,” added one user, “is if the two Taiwanese managers did this, and SBL completely didn’t know about it, why haven’t they sued them?” (There is no indication Wang is Taiwanese.) “They definitely cannot not know about this,” replied another.\n\nIn the office building, Emma and Alan sat around a table with five people, one of whom told them she represented all of the group’s sites in Shanghai. There was one small window in the room, and the lights were extremely bright. The company was indeed offering them a 40 per cent refund, or a discount on a new centre. The woman claimed that because the company had only 30 per cent of the shares in the centre, this was more than it needed to offer. Alan, who like his wife works in finance, contested this. “Don’t think we are so easy to fool,” he said. In his view, it was “sophistry”. The woman got angry. “We can’t rule out suing you directly,” she said.\n\nAt this Alan said his emotions got the better of him. “I usually pretend to be angry in negotiations,” he said, “but I really was angry.” The negotiation broke down. He slammed the table. In hindsight, his outburst proved helpful. It prompted an additional discount of Rmb40,000 on the new centre, though it would still cost the couple Rmb60,000 (about $8,200) on top of what they had spent already. The deal required them to sign a document saying they would not talk about Saint Bella in the media, on social media or in the rights group, nor would they take legal action against it. Saint Bella declined to comment on the meeting.\n\nAfter three hours, Alan and Emma left. There was another family waiting outside.\n\nThe following day, under the name Beikang International and referencing its Saint Bella brand, the company released a statement distancing itself from the operations of YueGe, the company at the centre of the controversy. Neither Emma nor Alan remembers seeing it specifically, though similar points emerged in the WeChat group.\n\nAccording to the company, it never intended to have any involvement with YueGe. Its connection came through a sprawl of subsidiaries typical of mainland China. The statement said that in February 2024 it had acquired a majority stake in YueZiGe, a post-partum centre business in Shanghai previously associated with a Taiwanese woman. But YueZiGe, in turn, owned a majority stake in a consultancy company, which in turn owned a majority stake in YueGe (the statement mentioned Liang by name as legal representative, but did not mention Wang). As a result, Beikang said it had a 23.35 per cent indirect stake in YueGe.\n\nAs a minority shareholder at the time of the incident, the company said it did “not bear any legal responsibility” for YueGe’s insolvency.\n\nSaint Bella’s founder, Xiang Hua, declined to comment. But in a further statement provided to the FT, the company said it became aware of the incident with YueGe only after employees and clients, given public knowledge of the above stake, began to claim compensation from it.\n\nThe company said that “despite bearing no fault or responsibility for this incident”, it “provided emergency support” to affected customers, employees and matrons “out of a sense of social responsibility”.\n\nThe company declined to comment on the removal of online content. The official statement released in March, which hit out against “false statements and malicious accusations”, was later taken down from Xiaohongshu, the platform where it was initially published. “We removed the statement once the issue subsided to better focus on core business activities,” the company said, adding it was still publicly available elsewhere.\n\nIt also said a loan from YueZiGe to YueGe was made in August 2023, before its acquisition of the former company was complete. It said the loan was unrelated to Beikang, and it was unaware of any operational issues at the time. After the incident arose, it said it sought assistance from regulatory authorities and had filed a lawsuit against YueGe to recover the loan. It said it no longer has any indirect stake.\n\nAs for what had given rise to the complaints of YueGe customers, the original statement had a simple explanation: “poor management”.\n\nIn May, Emma gave birth to a daughter, Sherry. In line with the deal, she completed her post-partum confinement at another Shanghai site associated with Saint Bella. Part of a luxurious hotel, the brightly lit rooms at the site are full of green plants. A timetable of activities for mothers, including meditation, is propped up by the wall. Guests must spray their shoes and hands with disinfectant before entering. Emma and Alan said they were pleased with the experience.\n\nOne of the last discussions on the WeChat group was about how much money had been collectively involved, calculated through a list function. The total came to about Rmb4mn-5mn ($550,000 —$690,000), an amount that might easily fly under the radar in terms of attracting wider attention. Local broadcast state media in Shanghai did cover the story, talk of which rippled through the city, though participants’ faces were blurred out.\n\nThe group soon fell quiet, but intriguing messages occasionally trickled through, including a YueGe doctor’s claim on March 13 that he had not been paid for eight months, since, he said, Beikang had become involved, and that in the eight years working with YueGe and YueZiGe prior to that, he had always been paid on time. The company did not comment on the post.\n\nThen, on March 26, a message appeared that was longer and more detailed than any that had come before. This poster alleged that he had reported the incident to the police on Monday March 11 2024, and had now received a reply: making reference to transfers between YueGe and YueZiGe, the police said no misappropriation of funds could be determined and no case could be filed.\n\nDespite this the poster claimed YueGe’s operating funds were transferred out of the company through a loan agreement, including the last few deposits from parents-to-be, and that Wang and Liang had told him this at the time of the complaint. Owing to the “equity arrangement”, the poster suggested Saint Bella could remove money from its subsidiaries and offer compensation at a proportion of the amount. He added that the settlement agreement with Saint Bella had been signed by his wife, and did not bind him. “They’ve done something beautiful,” replied bee emoji.\n\nSaint Bella did not comment on the post in the rights group WeChat. But in its statement to the FT, the company said it won its case against YueGe over the August 2023 loan. It did not respond to requests about whether any of the funds were recovered, but provided screenshots of court documents from October 31 last year, which showed a Shanghai court ordered YueGe to repay a loan principal amount of Rmb2mn, as well as interest and damages.\n\nOne other party was absent from the conversation: the Taiwanese woman associated with YueZiGe. Could she have helped to resolve the situation at YueGe? In its statement to the FT, Saint Bella said the other shareholder was “unable to participate due to illness”. The FT was unable to contact the woman.\n\nIn Shanghai, there are no longer any signs of YueGe. The site Emma and Alan first visited is still a confinement centre, but on the 16th floor nurses now wear badges with the name Baby Bella, one of the Saint Bella group’s several brands across the 25 cities in which it operates.\n\nSometimes Alan finds himself telling the story to friends and colleagues. One time he scrutinised the WeChat account of Wang, the manager who had so impressed them. He found only the vaguest of clues, a one-word signature. “Rensheng” it said, a Chinese word meaning “life”, followed by five dots and a single question mark.\n\nThomas Hale is the FT’s Shanghai correspondent.

    "blurb": "Billionaire faces setbacks as he tried to build China’s answer to Nvidia",
    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chinese crypto and artificial intelligence mogul Zhan Ketuan is facing a crisis.\n\nUS custom officials in recent months have impounded some shipments of Bitcoin mining rigs made by his company Bitmain. The pressure on the 45-year-old billionaire ramped up further this month, after Washington sanctioned his other companies that design and source artificial intelligence processors.\n\nIt is not the first time that Zhan’s ambitions to build China’s answer to Nvidia have jeopardised his business empire. Bitmain was nearly undone five years ago by his heavy spending to develop AI chips, sparking a civil war with his co-founder for control of the company.\n\nWhile Bitmain continues to focus on crypto mining, Zhan subsequently shifted those AI chip efforts into Xiamen Sophgo Technologies, which along with 15 affiliates, was added to the US commerce department entity list this month.\n\nThe company’s troubles began when an AI processor made by the world’s premier chip fabricator, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, was found in a Huawei AI card, allegedly circumventing sanctions. TSMC began investigating if it was purchased by Sophgo.\n\nThe US said that Sophgo posed a risk of diversion to Huawei and alleged it was “acting at the behest of Beijing” to build up China’s indigenous chip production.\n\nSophgo, Bitmain and Zhan did not respond to requests for comment. Sophgo has previously denied working with Huawei and Bitmain said it was not involved in the matter.\n\nTSMC declined to comment on customer relationships but said that, as a law-abiding company, it was committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations including export controls.\n\nZhan’s latest challenges show the hurdles Chinese entrepreneurs face, particularly for those keen to make a mark in semiconductors, where the whiplash of US-China geopolitics has set back many of the country’s most ambitious tech companies.\n\nPeople with knowledge of Sophgo’s operations describe a number of semiconductor related business lines. They include designing in-house AI processors and central processing units for supercomputers, as well as sourcing cutting edge Nvidia graphics processing units for Chinese data centres.\n\nThe US blacklisting formally cuts Sophgo off from TSMC, and could potentially pose challenges for its partner Bitmain, which also relies on the Taiwanese chipmaker to manufacture its chips.\n\nPeople close to Bitmain said access to TSMC helped it become the world’s dominant maker of Bitcoin mining rigs with an estimated 80 per cent of the market. For years Bitmain spent hundreds of millions of dollars pre-purchasing TSMC capacity, forcing rival miner makers to turn to other less capable chip foundries, the people said.\n\n“The energy-efficient chip is the heart of a mining machine,” said Nishant Sharma, founder of crypto mining advisory BlocksBridge Consulting.\n\nZhan was designing chips for TV sets when Bitcoin started to gain traction. In 2013, he turned his technical prowess towards designing specialised processors known as ASICs to more efficiently execute the hashing algorithms that unlock new Bitcoins. By 2017, Bitmain’s sales had jumped to $2.5bn, according to an IPO prospectus. Zhan’s vision for the company expanded towards AI. In the US, Google had just unveiled ASICs for running deep-learning algorithms, which it called TPUs.\n\n“We are a company focused on high-performance processors,” Zhan told a gathering in Beijing in 2017. “We started with cryptocurrency processors and now we’re entering artificial intelligence, it’s a new area of application but not a complete pivot.”\n\nBitmain’s first AI chip, the BM1680, was made by TSMC and shipped in 2017. But then the price of bitcoin started to fall, and along with it demand for crypto mining rigs. Hopes for a blockbuster Bitmain IPO in Hong Kong vanished.\n\nThe start-up laid off hundreds of employees and Zhan’s co-founder Wu Jihan ousted him and reined in spending on AI. Zhan fought back by taking control of a Bitmain AI chip unit registered in his hometown of Fujian and sued Wu. The company, Fujian Sophon, told a court that Zhan’s ousting had the potential to change the direction of “our country’s chip and blockchain development”. Eventually Wu left.\n\nIn 2022, Zhan moved Bitmain’s AI chip efforts to Sophgo, which he owned almost entirely when it was set up. The lines between the two companies remain blurry. Bitmain’s and Sophgo’s affiliated entities share some executives, addresses and phone numbers in official Chinese business records. Last year, they jointly sought to recruit new graduates at Harbin Institute of Technology, according to an advert.\n\nOne customer for their AI chips, Haitu Technology, described Sophgo as Bitmain’s “recommended distributor” in a filing to Chinese securities regulators in late 2022. Bitmain itself does not sell its AI processors to small and medium-sized companies, Haitu said.\n\nSophgo has sent its AI processors to public security bureaus and smart city projects in Fujian, Anhui and Beijing, according to a company presentation seen by the Financial Times. Its AI accelerators have also been used to build an AI computing cluster in Shandong.\n\nNick Brown, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, said the company’s latest CPU, the SG2042, represented a leap forward for the open source RISC-V architecture it was built on, and was comparable with Intel and AMD processors for some supercomputing tasks.\n\n“For workloads that need lots of computation, lots of processing, lots of calculations, it performs really well,” Brown said, after testing the chips on the university’s supercomputing hardware.\n\n“It’s the first RISC-V CPU that you could say is a serious proposition for high performance workloads,” said Brown.\n\nPublic records show some Chinese supercomputing centres, which are cut off from American chips, have begun to use Sophgo’s processors.\n\n“Once Chinese companies gain a foothold, western companies basically stand no chance,” Zhan told a conference in 2019. Now Sophgo will have to figure out how to get its processors made in China.\n\nAdditional reporting by Eleanor Olcott and Nian Liu in Beijing",

    "blurb": "Denton Peng had hoped to replicate his past successes, but roadblocks emerged in his adopted country",
    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Denton Peng, the onetime “solar king” of China who was briefly the country’s youngest billionaire, emigrated to California in 2018 with plans to defibrillate a moribund industry: electric buses. Now several years into the effort, shares of his company Phoenix Motor trade for mere pennies and it has received two delisting warnings from Nasdaq. Despite generous US subsidies to help cities adopt zero-emission mass transit, Phoenix was able to deliver only about 40 buses in 2024, and it has lost money in every year of operation under Peng’s leadership. The story of Phoenix illustrates the inherent challenge of manufacturing electric vehicles in the US and the seemingly quixotic goal of government-backed incentives to get the industry off the ground, much less become competitive with its Chinese counterparts. Though both China and the US have provided seed funding to the fledgling industry, inefficiency and cost structures — especially for labour — make western production a long-shot challenge.\n\nOut of the top 10 electric-bus makers in the world, only two are based in the US — one of which was bought by Peng after it went bankrupt. “Peng is just running into the same issues that many US electric-car makers are facing — that they can’t build a profitable vehicle without a huge part of their supply chain being from China,” said Tu Le, founder of Sino Auto Insights, a Detroit-based consultancy. “Regardless of how much is reshored, the United States will have a hard time getting to the cost level with China.”\n\nChina’s EV industry features a large pool of cheap and productive labour, as well as a highly efficient supply chain few countries can rival.\n\n“If it takes one month to complete a project in China,” said Peng in an interview with the Financial Times, “it takes four to five in the US.”\n\nGovernment support played a crucial role in driving Peng’s earlier success. When he faced a funding gap to make the profitable yet capital-intensive solar wafer, a key component of solar cells, in 2005, local authorities in China lent him Rmb200mn and encouraged banks to provide more than Rmb25bn lines of credit for his venture, called LDK. Chinese press nicknamed him the “solar king”.\n\nBusiness prospered as the company profited from the solar power boom in European countries. The bonanza ended after western nations began imposing sanctions on Chinese solar products in 2012, a blow to LDK that relied on developed markets for growth.\n\nPeng lost control of LDK in 2012 after the local government took over the company. Chinese authorities accused him of fraud related to a subsequent group he launched. Peng denied wrongdoing.\n\nPeng bought Phoenix Motorcars, a California-based electric-bus maker, for $12.5mn as he sought to return to manufacturing.\n\n“There is a chance I can succeed in making EVs in the US,” he said.\n\nThree years later, Peng paid $10mn to acquire the transit bus operation of Proterra, a leading electric-bus maker that filed for bankruptcy a few months earlier, as he looked to increase capacity to meet orders.\n\nPhoenix merged with Proterra, creating one of the biggest electric-bus makers in the country. There was no shortage of demand for the vehicles as both the federal and state governments made a push to build more environmentally friendly public transit systems.\n\nThe Federal Transit Administration has over the past three years provided $4.9bn in subsidies for local authorities to purchase more than 4,600 zero or low emission buses, mostly electric ones.\n\nWhile the programme is a boon for Phoenix, it comes with a caveat — the company must locally source more than 70 per cent of its parts, measured by value, to qualify for the subsidy.\n\nThat has slowed down production and created a backlog of orders as the EV supply chains in the US remain under-developed.\n\n“The US EV industry is facing challenges in building a more efficient and affordable supply chain,” said Peng. “We have trouble meeting orders partly because our suppliers are slow in making deliveries.”\n\nPavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said the US electric bus industry, while growing fast, was “too small to produce on a scale” that allows a well-established supply chain to emerge.\n\nMolchanov added that it would take at least five years for the US electric bus market to become “meaningful”.\n\nYet Peng could barely afford to wait for that long. Shares of Phoenix have traded at less than $1 — a threshold that could trigger delisting by Nasdaq — most of the time since he bought Proterra in 2023.\n\nThe best solution is to work with Chinese suppliers that enjoy cost and quality advantages over their US counterparts.\n\nPeng said Phoenix two years ago launched, without government subsidy, an electric shuttle bus aimed at commercial clients that cost 65 per cent less than its previous model by outsourcing parts to China.\n\nYet the Buy America requirement for government-subsidised electric transit buses, a major source of revenue for Phoenix, has made it difficult for Peng to replicate his cost-cutting magic.\n\nHe said he did not use Chinese-made batteries, known for their low price and high efficiency, for products with federal subsidy as they accounted for at least 30 per cent of the costs of components needed to make a bus.\n\nDespite the challenge, Peng is still keen to tap Chinese suppliers when possible. He said he was considering building electric bus or parts factories in China where production costs were less than half of the level in the US.\n\nThe new factories, according to Peng, would serve markets outside the US under an American brand and technology, which customers were willing to pay a premium for.\n\nPeng added that his future car parts factories in China would “certainly consider” serving the US market if policy allowed.\n\nMolchanov of Raymond James said outsourcing to China “makes a lot of sense from an economic perspective”, but could be “politically controversial”.\n\nHe went on to warn that Trump’s pledge to revoke electric vehicle support might create “additional headwind” for electric buses that could become out of reach for buyers without government subsidy.\n\nPeng has pinned his hopes on environmentally conscious states such as California that will ban sales of gas-powered cars by 2035.\n\n“As long as we can survive until then,” he said, “our company will definitely grow into a big one.”",

    "body": "A couple of days before the Chinese New Year of 2004, my friend Fan Qun, her husband and I travelled by bus, minibus, boat and, finally, foot, to her family’s remote village in the hills of Hunan province; her two brothers, migrant workers in Guangzhou, had also returned for the festival. On New Year’s Eve, we rounded up a rooster from the paddy fields outside and her father dispatched it quickly with a cleaver, while the meat of a fattened pig that had already been slaughtered was smoked above the kitchen fire. Fan Qun’s father made offerings to his ancestors at a domestic altar laid with the pig’s head, a whole smoked fish and a block of tofu, as well as enamelled mugs of rice wine and homegrown tea.\n\nAll day, Fan Qun’s mother and sister-in-law laboured in the kitchen. A chicken stew hung in a blackened cauldron over the fire; another pot filled with dried radishes sat in the embers. Steam billowed from the woks as the two women sizzled meats and vegetables on an old-fashioned, wood-fired range. Mid-afternoon, they brought out the feast: sweet, golden fritters of glutinous rice, home-cured bacon and carp, Cantonese roast duck brought home by the brothers, a magnificent rooster soup with medicinal herbs, dried squid with jujubes, smoked pork intestines, dishes of tofu and homegrown vegetables and a potful of rice with sweet potatoes. The young nieces, dressed in festive scarlet and pink, sang a song. Then we drank toasts of grain liquor and Coca-Cola and ate. At midnight, we all went outside to light firecrackers that snapped, sputtered and echoed up and down the valley.\n\nThe New Year’s Eve reunion dinner (tuan nian fan) is at the heart of Lunar New Year celebrations all over the world. Traditionally, family members return to their ancestral homes for a sumptuous banquet of home-cooked dishes, followed by a week or two of idling and visiting relatives and friends. In rural areas of China, home-reared pork is often served, along with chicken and a whole fish, the latter because the phrase “a fish every year” (nian nian you yu) sounds the same as “a surplus every year”. But as the Chinese world is on a scale to rival Christendom, local festive food customs vary as much as global Christmas dinners. In the wheat-eating north of China, people traditionally prepare jiaozi dumplings, while the Sichuanese steam fat slices of pork belly in clay bowls packed with salted vegetables. In many parts of the country, families gather around bubbling hotpots packed with meatballs, quail eggs, chunks of pork belly and other delicacies.\n\nWhile the symbolic whole fish is almost ubiquitous on the Chinese festive table, the Cantonese are particularly playful with the auspicious meanings of their New Year dishes (the Chinese language is replete with homonyms and therefore ripe for punning). Slabs of New Year Cake, a sweet pudding made from glutinous rice, are eaten over the holidays because their name, nian gao, plays on another word with the same sound (gao): “higher” — in wealth, school grades, status or stature. In advance of the festivities, people gift each other coupons that can be redeemed at specific restaurants or shops for this and other seasonal cakes, also known as gao, made from radish and taro (“radish cake futures,” my Cantonese friend Roberta quips). Kumquats and mandarins are served because their golden colour invites prosperity, along with ruddy deep-fried chickens — red being the traditional colour of Chinese celebrations.\n\nIn Hong Kong and other centres of Cantonese society, restaurants create menus of lucky-number eight dishes, each one with a name that signifies luck, wealth or one of the other bonuses of life. “So many people dine out around the New Year that we have to offer set menus because the kitchen cannot cope with à la carte,” says Lau Kin-wai, veteran food columnist and proprietor of Kin’s Kitchen in the Wanchai district. His restaurant is offering two set menus this year, priced per table at figures in Hong Kong dollars involving lots of auspicious “8”s: the pricier “Four Seasons of Prosperity” menu, for example, costs HK$9,888 ($1,270/£1,030) for a table of 12. Every dish has a poetic name imbued with optimistic meanings, seasonal symbolism or punning words, from “Make a Fortune, Increase Wealth and Honour” (a dish made with hair moss — facai, which sounds the same as “make a fortune” — and “golden coin” dried scallops) to “Golden Dragon Welcomes the New Year” (tiger shrimps in cheese sauce with egg noodles) and “Dancing Phoenix Augments the Joyful Occasion” (deep-fried chicken).\n\n“When I was small,” says Lau, “people didn’t have much money and cooked more themselves, so the New Year’s Eve dinner normally took place at home. We would stock up on seasonal foods like cured pork and dried oysters [their name a pun on ‘good business’], as well as lucky sweets and seeds to offer visitors. On the first day of the New Year, we would eat a vegetarian meal because the markets were closed.\n\n“These days,” he adds, “more and more Hongkongers have their celebratory meal in restaurants. And in the past few years, they’ve been increasingly popping over to Shenzhen on the mainland, where they can eat lavishly for half the price, or seizing the chance to fly off on a foreign holiday.”\n\nCantonese food customs have spilled over into diaspora communities. Chinese restaurants all over the world offer New Year cakes and symbolic menus. In recent years, an auspicious Malaysian and Singaporean dish has become wildly popular in Chinese circles all over the world: yu sheng, or “prosperity toss”. A colourful assembly of shredded ingredients, including raw fish, are bathed in a sweet dressing, then everyone around the table tosses the food together with their chopsticks while voicing good wishes for the year ahead — and the higher the ingredients fly above the table, the “higher” the luck. This year, far from China, that New Year with Fan Qun’s family a distant memory, I’ll be celebrating over a home-cooked Shanghainese feast in London — and I’m looking forward to tossing the prosperity salad while welcoming the Year of the Snake.\n\nFuchsia Dunlop is the author of “Invitation to a Banquet: The Story of Chinese Food”, Fortnum & Mason Food Book of 2024\n\nWherever you are in the world, how do you celebrate the Lunar New Year?

    "body": "President Donald Trump threatened tariffs so many times against so many nations before his re-election that some wondered whether he was serious. In the event, his first target was Colombia, a South American oil and coffee exporter. Its harsh treatment last Sunday holds lessons for other nations weighing the consequences of the president’s America First policies.\n\nAs a leftwing former guerrilla, Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro was never going to be a Trump fan. But he incurred the US president’s particular wrath after publicly vowing to turn back American military flights deporting migrants, complaining that his compatriots were being treated like criminals.\n\nFor a few hours, Bogotá’s status flipped from traditional Washington ally to rogue state. Trump announced immediate 25 per cent tariffs on Colombian imports, rising to 50 per cent in a week, banking sanctions and a US travel ban for Colombian government officials and their allies. Petro initially vowed retaliatory tariffs but quickly folded. He had little choice. For Colombia, a trade war with its biggest trading partner would have been devastating.\n\nDenmark and Panama will have been watching closely. Both are small nations in Trump’s sights because they possess valuable territorial assets he covets. In Denmark’s case, it is the strategic Arctic territory of Greenland and in Panama’s, the shipping canal built by America over a century ago.\n\nMexico and Canada, US neighbours and big trading partners, are waiting to discover whether Trump will fulfil a threat to impose 25 per cent tariffs as soon as Saturday, tearing up three decades of North American free trade.\n\nRepublicans may be celebrating Trump’s quick win over a comparatively weak South American president, who had apparently not thought through his impulsive decision. (Colombia had been accepting US military flights deporting its nationals since well before Trump’s inauguration). But the long-term consequences of punishing and publicly humiliating an erstwhile ally are unlikely to favour the US.\n\nWashington has long portrayed itself as a reliable trade and security partner because it can be trusted to stick to international agreements and follow rules. In the Trump era, this no longer appears to be a given. While America has a right to detain and deport migrants who enter illegally — and Trump has an electoral mandate for that — anti-US sentiment around the world is likely to be stoked by a return to the bullying tactics of a bygone era.\n\nThere is a potential opening here for the EU to provide an alternative to America First, by stepping up its own investment in the region and ratifying a long-stalled trade pact with South American nations. But China and Russia will be looking for opportunities.\n\nBeijing has touted itself to developing nations as a trusted long-term partner interested in trade and investment rather than playing politics. The experience of some African and Latin American nations has sometimes shown otherwise, but compared with Trump’s unpredictable tactics, Beijing may start to look more attractive.\n\nBy choosing in his first week to make threats against Colombia, Panama and Mexico, some of the closest US allies in the Americas, Trump has signalled a shift away from the soft power approach the US has favoured in recent decades to a harder form of power. While that may — as it did with Colombia — deliver short-term results, in the longer term it is just as likely to drive countries away from America. Since Beijing has already demonstrated its willingness to invest heavily in the region, the big winner from Trump’s policies may ultimately not be the US, but China.",

    "blurb": "A Chinese advance tests the assumptions behind lofty US tech valuations",
    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "America’s superinflated tech stocks had seemed due for a correction for months, but the trigger has come from an unexpected source. The latest large language model from China’s artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek may not be quite a “Sputnik moment”. There are parallels, even so, with the early space race, when ingenuity helped Soviet engineers keep pace with and sometimes surpass US rivals, despite their relative lack of computing power and cutting-edge technologies. The US went on to win the Moon race, and establish a sustainable edge in space. But DeepSeek’s breakthrough upturns the assumptions that have underpinned US tech valuations, of an unassailable supremacy in AI that would be extended by spending billions of dollars on chips and infrastructure.\n\nDeepSeek’s achievement is to have developed an LLM that AI experts say achieves a performance similar to US rivals OpenAI and Meta but claims to use far fewer — and less advanced — Nvidia chips, and to have been trained for a fraction of the cost. Some of its assertions remain to be verified. If they are true, however, it represents a potentially formidable competitor.\n\nFirst, like Meta of the US but unlike OpenAI or Google’s Gemini, it is open source — ready to share the recipe for its secret sauce rather than keep it locked away in hope of extracting maximum financial gain. That makes it appealing for developers to use and build on. Second, it can be put together on much more of a shoestring budget and with much less computing power. This explains Monday’s plunging stock prices not just of front-line tech companies but of those that make chip equipment and supply electrical hardware for data centres.\n\nThe big US companies are focused on a particular model of scaling AI by throwing vast amounts of capital, data and computing power at the problem. First Mistral, a French AI start-up, and now DeepSeek have demonstrated that companies with fewer resources may end up with smarter and more efficient models. The increasing efficiency of these models is also likely to spur increased demand for their use.\n\nDeepSeek’s advance highlights, too, that China is managing to make technological leaps in AI despite export controls introduced by the Biden administration intended to deprive it of both the most powerful chips and the advanced tools needed to make them. Chinese AI start-ups have been compelled to find inventive ways of extracting the most juice from the chips they do have. Far from stifling Chinese innovation, Washington may have stimulated it. And the success of often domestically trained Chinese engineers in increasing efficiency and finding workarounds raises questions over whether the technological “moat” established by high-spending US groups such as Meta, Google, OpenAI and Anthropic is as wide and impregnable as they had thought.\n\nMany advanced democracies will be wary of a Chinese government seen in many ways as inimical to western interests potentially acquiring leadership in the most transformative technology of our era. Yet some political leaders elsewhere, along with many consumers and developers, may welcome a market that is less dominated by a handful of American companies.\n\nThe open question now is not necessarily who will develop the best AI models but who can apply them best to real-world tasks. Kai-Fu Lee, a Chinese AI pioneer, has long argued that China excels on the application front even if it may lag behind in infrastructure. That was before the Chinese start-up world was squeezed by the political clampdown on tech entrepreneurs and the surge of investment in US AI start-ups. But after DeepSeek’s achievement, it looks a much more even game.",

    "blurb": "If the US president takes a more flexible approach, tariffs may end up being used as a bargaining tool rather than end goal",
    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "When US presidents opine on China, it is rarely good news for investors in Chinese equities. At least in recent years, announcements have tended to mark punitive measures such as blacklists, export restrictions and tariffs.\n\nThat trend was bucked on Friday. Chinese stocks rose after Donald Trump remarked on a “friendly” conversation with Xi Jinping and hinted at a potentially softer approach toward tariffs. The diplomatic cordiality between geopolitical rivals may not guarantee lasting progress on trade talks. Yet for local stocks, it arrives at a perfect time.\n\nBlue-chips such as Tencent, Alibaba and JD.com gained 3 per cent on Friday, as did Hong Kong’s benchmark index which is particularly sensitive to geopolitical tensions. The Hang Seng rose about 2 per cent, bringing gains to 6 per cent since last week. That suggests relief that Trump says he would rather not have to use tariffs against on Chinese goods — a big question hanging over valuations for the past year.\n\nChina’s exports to the US account for about 4 per cent of its GDP. In the short term, tariffs drive up costs for Chinese exporters and squeeze margins. Their long-term effects, such as weakening the renminbi and inflating risk premium for Chinese stocks, raise concerns about capital flight. If Trump is taking a more flexible approach, these measures may end up being used as a bargaining tool with China rather than an end goal.\n\nThat in turn allows investors to consider other factors that could support Chinese stocks in future. Beijing is trying to improve shareholder returns. Large-scale stimulus measures and plans to inject around Rmb1tn ($138bn) in long-term capital into the financial system ought to improve sentiment.\n\nChinese companies paid out a record Rmb2.4tn in dividends last year while share buybacks also hit an all-time high, according to official data. This push has particularly benefited high-dividend stocks, such as banks, insurers and utilities. Meanwhile, regulators have been directing insurers and mutual funds to increase local stock holdings — which could draw more capital into the country’s markets.\n\nValuations remain relatively low, with China’s blue-chip CSI 300 Index trading at around 1.3 times book value. By contrast, the S&P 500 stands at around four times that level.\n\nThe reliance of local exporters’ earnings on geopolitical dynamics means their share prices will remain highly sensitive to unfolding developments in the coming months. But for now, there is enough good news — both real and rhetorical — to support short-term gains.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com",

    "blurb": "Trump’s slogan is a bet on the energy status quo, not on the future",
    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "What happens when the world’s largest oil producer goes all-out to boost production just as the appetite of the world’s largest oil importer may be peaking? Demand from China — which has accounted for half of all world oil demand growth over three decades — shows signs of levelling off thanks to slowing economic expansion and an epochal shift to green power and electric vehicles. Returning US President Donald Trump has, meanwhile, declared a national energy emergency intended to boost fossil fuel output, and begun to reverse the Biden administration’s green agenda. In theory, these dynamics might lead to an oil glut and falling prices. The reality is more complex.\n\nThe US-China divergence is at root about competing visions of energy security. Beijing’s embrace of renewable energy reflects less a noble conversion to saving the planet, and more a strategic determination to reduce dependence on imported oil. Conversely, alongside the popularity of his “drill, baby, drill” mantra among consumers balking at the costs of the green transition, Trump does not want the US to rely on a green energy supply chain dominated by China.\n\nTrump’s Treasury secretary pick, Scott Bessent, suggests America can produce an additional 3mn barrels of oil-equivalent a day by 2028. There may be scope, in time, to lift output of natural gas, which the president is eager to export to Europe. For all the rhetoric and deregulation, however, US oil production — which at 13mn b/d is already a record for any country — will be much harder to raise. Producers are unlikely to boost drilling a lot at current US benchmark prices of about $75 a barrel; a recent survey found oil groups needed a $65 price for drilling to be profitable, and $89 to justify a substantial increase.\n\nAt the same time, exports from some other suppliers may fall — thanks to US actions. The departing Biden administration this month imposed stiff new sanctions on Russian oil, which by some estimates could remove up to 2mn b/d from the market. The new US president threatened this week to go further unless Vladimir Putin strikes a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Tougher US moves to restrict Iranian exports, in line with Trump’s first-term approach, could take hundreds of thousands of barrels a day more off the market.\n\nThis would open a potential opportunity for the world’s swing producer — Saudi Arabia; the Opec consortium has for months been holding back planned production increases, to balance the market with Chinese demand drooping. Trump’s programme could then lead ironically to Saudi Aramco, more than US oil companies, opening the spigots. (Addressing the World Economic Forum on Thursday, the US president explicitly called on Opec to push down global oil prices.) For Trump, this could create leeway to pursue his geopolitical goals without pushing up prices at the pump. Even if US oil producers do not end up raising their own output by much, they will be happy to see Trump acting to stimulate demand, for example by cutting incentives to switch to EVs.\n\nIndeed, Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” slogan seems aimed at giving confidence to oil and gas producers, not just in America but in much of the world. It symbolises his intention to remove the regulatory controls and environmental, social and governance investment principles that have constrained the industry in recent years, and his repudiation of efforts to curb climate change.\n\nIt is hard to see how those efforts can succeed without a vast global shift to electric power from green sources. Though it is still burning a lot of coal, China’s green energy shift looks, then, like a bet on the future, while the US is betting on the status quo. There may be hard-nosed reasons for Trump’s America to make that choice. But the consequences may be that the US is left on the “wrong” side of history — and the existential battle to contain global warming is dealt a severe blow.",

    "blurb": "Underestimating the ingenuity of Chinese competitors has proven unwise",
    "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "There was a time when nearly every hotel room seemed to have a TV with a Sony, Panasonic, Samsung or LG logo on the bottom of the screen. Affordable Chinese models have long been chipping away at the dominance of such Japanese and South Korean brands. Now, however, China’s ascent is about more than just price.\n\nTake what’s happening in Japan. Local brands are increasingly being displaced by Chinese manufacturers on their home turf. Chinese makers accounted for more than half of all flat-screen TVs sold in Japan last year for the first time on record, according to research firm BCN.\n\nIn the past, Chinese companies have disrupted industries primarily through cheapness. That meant even as they gained market share, a clear distinction remained between premium and budget segments. The high-end market, which typically has fatter margins, still provided a lucrative buffer for incumbent players to sustain their business as Chinese makers focused on affordability. That may now be changing.\n\nTV makers aiming to capture the premium segment typically differentiate themselves in two ways: advancements in display technology and the integration of artificial intelligence features. Chinese electronics groups including Hisense, TCL and Xiaomi have been quick to integrate the latest AI features into their TVs to enhance picture clarity, contrast and colour based on real-time scene detection, as well as suggest content based on user preferences. They also offer seamless integration with global smart TV platforms and streaming services.\n\nPremium TVs using Oled technology, which enables ultra-slim display panels and vivid colours, were once the exclusive domain of Japanese and South Korean makers. These TVs offered higher profit margins compared with traditional LCD TVs, offsetting weakness in the lower-end market. Yet over the past five years, Chinese makers led by Xiaomi, TCL and Hisense have been aggressively expanding their offerings here, as their investments in display innovation begin to pay off.\n\nShares of Xiaomi have more than doubled in the past six months, while TCL Electronics stock has nearly tripled in the past year. Even after those gains, TCL trades at just below 12 times forward earnings — a steep discount to Japanese peers. That would be justifiable if Chinese TV makers weren’t moving upmarket.\n\nUnderestimating the ingenuity of Chinese competitors has proven unwise: look no further than DeepSeek’s dramatic arrival in the AI arms race. Investors in Japanese electronics groups used to regarding China as no more than a supporting actor should be on guard.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com",

    "blurb": "The hedge fund quant turned start-up leader rose from a rural Chinese village to overturn America’s AI monopoly ",
    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "In China, Liang Wenfeng is being celebrated as a hero this week, a digital David fighting America’s Big Tech Goliath, armed with a modest cluster of artificial intelligence chips and a small crack team of engineers.\n\nHis computational projectile was a series of papers released by his AI start-up DeepSeek, which appeared to show that it was possible to build powerful large language models with far fewer Nvidia chips than US rivals. Global investors wiped almost $600bn off Nvidia’s market capitalisation as a result, questioning whether pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into gargantuan AI computing clusters was necessary.\n\nThese concerns were all far from the minds of Mililing villagers, a small community in the southern province of Guangdong where Liang grew up and where the 40-year-old billionaire returned home for the Lunar New Year holiday, flanked by security guards. Mililing is so small that there appears to have hitherto been nothing written about it online in English.\n\nThe reception was jubilant. “Liang Wenfeng returns to his hometown to spread good results and add energy to rural revitalisation,” wrote one banner adorning an inflatable red arch.\n\nLiang’s family home has become an unlikely pilgrimage site for those interested in seeing where this reluctant celebrity was raised. But while his neighbours praised his achievements, none could say much about the current life of the mysterious man who has sparked an existential panic in Silicon Valley. DeepSeek and Liang did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLocals say Liang comes from a family of educators. His parents and grandfather were all teachers.\n\n“His parents are good people. He left the village for school at a young age,” says one neighbour also surnamed Liang but not related. Mililing, he says, is a village “of a thousand Liangs”.\n\nAt the middle school in the nearby town, one of his teachers says Liang stood out in the 50-student class as “well behaved and mild mannered”. “He was a top student, especially in maths. He liked reading comic books,” he adds.\n\nLiang left high school in 2002 and went to Zhejiang University to complete an undergraduate degree and a masters in computer science, where he penned a thesis about motion detection algorithms. After graduating in 2010, he parlayed his computing skills into automated stock trading, first as a freelancer then at his own hedge fund High-Flyer in 2015.\n\nHigh-Flyer has grown to become one of China’s top four quant funds, using algorithms to execute trades. After building a fortune in trading, Liang pivoted into generative AI, utilising both talent and computing resources from High-Flyer to launch DeepSeek in 2023.\n\nOne manager at a rival fund who has known Liang for years says: “He stands out from our crowd because he’s a true engineer. He thinks and acts like one. While we’re managing people and funds, he is coding every day.”\n\nLiang’s stated goal with DeepSeek is to pursue artificial general intelligence, a holy grail that OpenAI is also working towards, which will herald a time when computers are capable of humanlike critical thinking. The fund manager says Liang will finally “be able to entirely remove the human factor” by achieving AGI.\n\nLiang’s fellow quants are happy to see him find success with DeepSeek. “I hope this will mean Beijing will be more friendly to us,” says another trader.\n\nWhile quants are revered in the west as financial geniuses of the digital age, they have been vilified in China. During stock market routs, regulators have limited their activity, accusing quants of profiting at the expense of the country’s roughly 200mn retail investors. The wider finance industry has also experienced a number of rocky years, with officials capping pay at state-owned funds and criticising the sector for not contributing to societal development.\n\nBeijing has a more positive attitude towards AI companies and has recognised Liang’s contributions at DeepSeek. Before the holiday, he was selected as the only AI leader to join a publicised meeting with China’s second-in-command, Li Qiang. Along with a small group of entrepreneurs, he was exhorted to make technological breakthroughs for the country.\n\nIn public, Liang has remained silent, even as he has become a focal point in US-China tensions, with some US lawmakers reacting to DeepSeek’s progress by suggesting further limits on China’s access to Nvidia chips.\n\nLiang’s silence is true to his character. “For those who know him well, he can talk a lot when it’s a topic of interest. You need to get used to his communication style. He’s not being rude when he’s suddenly quiet, which often happens. He’s thinking,” says another fund manager. “If he doesn’t want to talk to you, he’ll let you know.”\n\nDeepSeek has not responded to attacks from US rivals, which range from accusations of technology theft to claims that the company is being used as an asset of the Chinese state.\n\nThe internet has also been left to hunt for clues about Liang, dissecting the sparse public information available.\n\nBut for residents of Mililing, he represents something more innocent: a hard-working student from a small farming community that made it big. “We all grew up in this village,” says Leon Liang, who used to play football with the younger Liang. “We’re very proud of him.”\n\neleanor.olcott@ft.com, zijing.wu@ft.com\n\nAdditional reporting by Ryan McMorrow in Beijing",

    "blurb": "Managers will be allowed to launch leveraged and inverse ETFs tracking single stocks overseas",
    "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Hong Kong’s securities regulator has announced that asset managers will be permitted to launch leveraged and inverse exchange traded funds tracking single stocks overseas, as well as defined outcome listed structured funds.\n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission said in a circular that single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs and defined outcome listed structured funds had become “increasingly popular in overseas markets”.\n\nSingle stock leveraged and inverse products have been available in Europe since 2018, with the US following suit in 2022, where they have proved popular with international investors looking to trade or hedge positions in large-cap stocks such as Nvidia and Tesla.\n\n“Against this backdrop, there has been growing interest among product issuers in launching them in Hong Kong, in the light of their distinct appeal to investors,” said the SFC.\n\nSingle stock leveraged and inverse products use derivatives to deliver multiples of the performance of a single stock’s daily price return, or profit from declines in their value.\n\nDefined outcome listed structured funds use options contracts to protect investors against losses, while capping their potential investment gains.\n\nSingle stock leveraged and inverse products could allow investors to trade or hedge their positions in individual stocks listed overseas and provide price discovery tools for overseas exposure during Asian trading hours, continued the regulator.\n\nChristina Choi, the SFC’s executive director of investment products, said the circular provided a “clear pathway for those seeking product authorisation”, while also spelling out the regulator’s expectation for products to meet robust regulatory standards.\n\nFor single-stock leveraged and inverse products, the SFC said it would only accept those tracking a “highly liquid megacap stock listed on a major overseas exchange”, excluding overseas stocks with a dual listing in Hong Kong, and stocks listed on any mainland exchange.\n\nThe maximum leverage of these products will be capped at a factor of 2x, or -2x.\n\nJean-Francois Mesnard-Sense, head of exchange traded products at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said Hong Kong had become the first market in Asia to offer single stock leveraged and inverse products.\n\n“This will further enhance our product ecosystem, reinforcing Hong Kong’s role as a leading ETP marketplace in Asia,” said Mesnard-Sense, adding that HKEX would work with issuers and stakeholders towards introducing the new products.\n\nSally Wong, chief executive of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association, said she welcomed greater flexibility to allow more innovation in product offering as a general principle.\n\nBut she also noted that the complexity and risk profile of these types of products would mean they would only be catering to a “very niche market segment”.\n\nHong Kong allowed the first leveraged and inverse products in 2016, initially limited to products tracking liquid and broadly based “non-Hong Kong, non-mainland foreign equity indexes”.\n\nProducts tracking Hong Kong’s stock market were added in 2017 and the product universe was extended to China’s onshore stock markets in 2020.\n\nBosera Asset Management, China Asset Management (HK), CSOP Asset Management and Fubon Fund Management have launched a total of 19 leveraged and inverse products in Hong Kong so far, tracking equities indexes and commodities including cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the circular, the SFC said the new product types would have to meet existing rules for listed structured funds and ETFs, in addition to some other requirements for leveraged and inverse products around their naming and other aspects.\n\nThe SFC does not allow leveraged and inverse products to be named “ETFs” in order to differentiate them from conventional ETFs. The products are also required to include the leverage or inverse factor and the word “daily” in the name, to emphasise their daily rebalancing feature.\n\nIssuers were also expected to conduct “extensive investor education before launching the funds in Hong Kong”, said the regulator.\n\nThe SFC might consider introducing further requirements applicable to specific types of listed structured funds as necessary, according to the circular.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

    "body": "In the white heat of the space race, America spent millions of taxpayer dollars developing a ball-point pen that would work in zero gravity. Confronted with the same problem the Russians used . . . a pencil.\n\nThis is, inconveniently, a fairytale. Both sides tried pencils and both sides ended up using the Space Pen, a product developed entirely in the private sector. But the myth often resurfaces as an industrial, geopolitical and ideological parable because it nicely captures the terror that infuses all those fields: that the other company/side/economic model can, and may, be structurally better placed to work smarter and cheaper.\n\nDid the “Space Pen” meme return this week as investors and governments gawped at China’s supposedly low-cost DeepSeek AI model, wondered whether US export controls had backfired, then lost their nerve around the billions invested in the more costly American approach to the same problem? Of course it did.\n\nThe more unsettling phrase of the moment, though, should be kaizen — the Japanese concept of “continuous improvement” which once struck nervous awe into US corporate hearts and which China, one way or another, now looks to have quietly mastered. Partly by hiring Japanese kaizen masters undervalued in their own economy.\n\nKaizen first properly entered the international business lexicon in the 1980s, when American and European companies needed to understand why Japanese companies were beating them — in terms of both price and quality — on cars, consumer electronics and semiconductors. It suited both sides to identify the differentiator as a patient, distinctly Japanese, betterment of product and process.\n\nThe practical effects of kaizen were remarkable: they were among the prime reasons that Japan’s economy became huge in the 1970s and 80s, and why so many of its companies retain global competitiveness in a formidable range of manufacturing fields.\n\nBut kaizen’s evolution during Japan’s long, stagnant post-bubble decades is perhaps more extraordinary. Once the era of financial excess evaporated, kaizen became a survival superpower: a simultaneous propellant of higher quality and leanness in corrosive times. Deflation, and the inability of Japanese manufacturers to secure pricing power in their domestic market, made cost-cutting a fine art.\n\nChinese manufacturers, with their attention long fixed on cost and technology, have been closely scrutinising all this, and have seen ways to make kaizen their own. DeepSeek may represent a software breakthrough, but it is one borne on the shoulders of a now relentlessly, incrementally advancing hardware sector.\n\nMany will argue that China’s acquisition of technology has been opportunist at best and underhanded at worst. Where outright theft or coercion is not blamed (and it is, frequently), foreign companies have lost key technology to badly formulated transfer deals or excessive optimism over the ability to protect IP. But that has long ceased to explain everything.\n\nIn China’s most recent and visible industrial achievements — the production of low-cost, competitive quality electric cars, consumer electronics, industrial machinery, high speed trains and robots — some version of kaizen is now at work. And there are reasons to suspect that the Chinese iteration may, for a stint, work faster, more disruptively and with more visible results, than the original.\n\nFirst, China has the numbers and talent to throw at kaizen on a much larger scale than Japan ever mustered. Increments work best when there are a lot of them.\n\nSecond, it is happening in an era where consumers are far quicker to identify and communicate when a product is not exactly as they would like it.\n\nBut a third is that they may be able to pay for speed. As well as directly observing kaizen in action at Japanese manufacturing operations, Chinese companies, according to recruitment agents in Tokyo, have found they can lure away Japanese semiconductor, railway and robotics engineers as consultants. This is not new, say the agents, but it is now sharply accelerating.\n\nJapanese companies tend to retire highly qualified people early, have not, for some years during the deflationary period, paid them especially handsomely and have instilled less parting loyalty than they might have hoped. They can be paid well by a Chinese company and, without explicitly imparting industrial secrets, their worth is immense: kaizen is fundamentally a process of trial and error, and an experienced engineer can impart the invaluable, cost-saving nod on what was tried but didn’t work.\n\nAdvice such as: forget the pencil, it was useless.\n\nleo.lewis@ft.com",

    "blurb": "The corporate and political winds appear to be blowing increasingly in that direction",
    "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Decoupling can be painful. Germany found that out the hard way after weaning itself off its dependence on cheap Russian gas following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNow German companies from Volkswagen and BMW to BASF and Mercedes-Benz are facing what could be a stiffer challenge: a potential scaling back of ties with China, once one of the main sources of their profits. The corporate and political winds appear to be blowing increasingly in that direction.\n\nFriedrich Merz, the frontrunner to become German chancellor in elections next month, warned companies that China was part of an “axis of autocracies” and that investing there involved “great risk”. “My heartfelt request to all companies . . . Limit the risk you take in order to avoid endangering your own company if it triggers an immediate write-off,” he said last week.\n\nThat appears to mark a change from the rhetoric of current chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has vaguely talked of “de-risking” from China but also lobbied for better market access for German companies on a trip last year to Beijing together with business leaders. There is also pressure from the US, increasing with Donald Trump’s presidency, for Germany to choose a side between Washington and Beijing.\n\nFor big German companies, this might all be beside the point. A decision on China ties may not be entirely in their hands to take.\n\nThe potential from China’s huge population and its rising middle class enticed German carmakers and metal bashing industrial companies to expand in the country, overriding any worries about geopolitical tensions or human rights concerns.\n\nBut long-standing correlation between Chinese economic growth and German exports to China has broken down since the Covid-19 pandemic. German exports to China increased faster than to any other major trading partner from 2015-20 but have fallen back since.\n\nGerman companies, particularly the carmakers, face huge market pressure in China. For years derided as producing cheap, clunky cars, Chinese manufacturers — admittedly heavily supported by the state — have shot past their German counterparts in developing electric vehicles.\n\nGerman carmakers’ EV market share in China was just 4 per cent in 2024, the lowest of any country, according to the German Association of the Automotive Industry. This matters as EV sales in China are more than double those in Europe, US, Canada, Japan and South Korea combined.\n\nOne non-German automotive boss thinks that German manufacturers need to give up on China, an especially difficult thing given how lucrative the market has been for them in the past. “Their share is pretty much going to zero. It will be painful,” he adds.\n\nThe issue is how painful and fast the process will be. VW delivered 4.2mn cars in China in 2019, making €4.4bn in operating profit. By 2023, those figures were down to 3.2mn deliveries and €2.6bn in operating profit.\n\nOverall, sales of foreign brands in China have fallen to a record low of less than 40 per cent market share, down from more than 60 per cent in 2020, according to data from Shanghai consultancy Automobility. China still represents between a quarter and almost half of sales for VW, BMW and Mercedes suggesting more suffering could come.\n\nGerman carmakers are keen to protect what they have, however, leading to some strange developments. Analysts estimate German groups such as VW may have to fork out hundreds of millions of euros to Chinese rivals to buy carbon credits to meet new EU pollution rules for this year.\n\nThen there is the spectacle of BMW and Mercedes joining Chinese manufacturers in suing the EU over tariffs on EVs from China. Ola Källenius, chief executive of Mercedes, also told the FT this month that the EU should instead try to encourage Chinese carmakers to open more plants in Europe.\n\nGerman carmakers are also pushing back against an EU ban on the sale of new fossil-fuel cars from 2035. All of which raises the question of whether German reluctance to decouple from an autocracy is driving EU policy in an unwanted direction.\n\n“German dependency on Russian gas slowed the transition to renewable energy. I’m worried now they are slowing our transition to EVs,” says one European industrial boss.\n\nHow this German de-risking or decoupling plays out will be one of the main European corporate stories of the coming years. Can its companies avoid a lose-lose situation, where they find themselves squeezed out of the Chinese market and/or outcompeted by Chinese rivals at home?\n\nrichard.milne@ft.com",

    "blurb": "Governments offer a catalogue of creative incentives for childbearing — yet fertility rates just keep dropping",
    "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Politicians in Lestijärvi thought they had the answer to Finland’s demographic woes: each mother of a newborn baby would receive €1,000 a year for 10 years if they stayed in the Nordic country’s second-smallest municipality.\n\nBut more than a decade after they introduced the payments, and over €400,000 poorer, officials were forced to concede defeat: Lestijärvi’s population has shrunk by a fifth since the scheme started.\n\n“It wasn’t worth doing at all,” said Niko Aihio, the town’s former head of education. “The baby boom only lasted one year.”\n\nPolicymakers around the world are grappling with the same problems as those in Lestijärvi: no matter what they seem to offer in the way of incentives, people are not having more babies. For the Finnish municipality it failed even to lure people from elsewhere: “It didn’t stop people moving away, and it didn’t attract new families,” Aihio said.\n\nChina has offered free fertility treatments, Hungary big tax exemptions and cash, and Singapore grants for parents and grandparents. A Danish travel company even ran an ad campaign to “Do it for Denmark”. In Japan, the state funds AI-powered matchmaking, while Tokyo’s metropolitan government is offering a four-day working week to staff in an attempt to encourage people to become parents.\n\nGovernments are still hunting for policy options to counter a looming economic crisis as older populations expand and the pool of workers shrinks. It is a shift that think-tank the Robert Schuman Foundation has called “demographic suicide”.\n\nThe reasons for the trend have been fiercely debated, while some potential solutions, such as immigration and pushing people to retire later, have proved deeply politically unpalatable.\n\n“The issue of population ageing presents multiple challenges for Europe,” said Olli Rehn, governor of the Finnish central bank. “First, the worsening dependency ratio is putting significant pressure on public finances. Second, an ageing society tends to be less economically dynamic and less entrepreneurial.”\n\nThe decline in birth rates is a peculiarly universal problem — no continent has been left unscathed by the trend. Two-thirds of the world’s population now lives in countries where people are having babies at a rate too low to replace their population.\n\nMore and more countries are joining the list. By 2100, just 12 countries — 11 in Africa and the tiny Pacific island state of Vanuatu — are expected to have fertility rates above the crucial level of 2.1 births per woman. Not a single country is expected to have a rate above 2.3 by the end of the century.\n\nPolicymakers may be tempted to focus on more immediate crises. But the decline in fertility rates threatens to lead to deep economic malaise. Fewer babies and more older residents lead to a lower proportion of people of working age, denting tax revenues at the same time as costs associated with ageing societies, such as state pensions and healthcare, increase.\n\nWithout sufficient policy action, analysts at rating agency S&P Global estimated in 2023 that fiscal deficits would balloon by 2060 from a global average now of 2.4 per cent of GDP to 9.1 per cent. The global net government debt-to-GDP level would very nearly triple.\n\nMeanwhile, a McKinsey report in January suggested many of the world’s richest economies, such as the UK, US and Japan, would need to at least double productivity growth to maintain historical improvements in living standards amid sharp falls in their birth rates.\n\nParts of Asia, especially China, and Latin American countries are particularly exposed. In 1995, 10 workers in eastern Asia supported one old-age person; by 2085, it is projected to be one to one.\n\nPoliticians worry that they may be powerless to act, as social pressures on women undergo a profound change. Sarah Harper, professor of gerontology and director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, said surveys of young women across the world, from Europe to south-east Asia, suggested a once built-in social obligation for women to reproduce — and an assumption on their part that if they could, they probably would have children — no longer existed.\n\nCareers and increased gender equality are a part of that. “We have a whole cohort of women in high-income countries, but also in south-east Asia, and particularly east Asia . . . who have been educated in a very gender-neutral way,” said Harper. “They enter the workplace in a gender-neutral way, and then they become parents and suddenly, no matter how hard one tries, it’s not gender-neutral.”\n\nPolicy is also likely to have little effect where norms around the number of children are ingrained. Harper noted that in China, despite the end of the one-child policy in 2016, women still generally had just one child.\n\n“Once you come to a one-child society, then why would you want to have two children? Because everyone has one child . . . everyone is geared up to having one child. Institutions are geared up to having one child,” Harper said.\n\nHeidi Colleran, an academic at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, said that despite decades of research and thousands of people working on demographic trends, there was little to no consensus on why fertility rates kept declining.\n\n“There’s lots of general threads to pull on: the rise of the nuclear family, changes in the age of marriage, the rate at which people live together, the age at which people start having their first child is getting older and older,” she said. “There’s lots of these individual-level features . . . and they’re all correct . . . [But] the same constellation of predictors, they are going to be correlated with each other in a different way in different places.”\n\nYet, while personal choice has played a part in the global decline in childbearing, studies indicate people are often having fewer children than they would like to — indicating there could still be a role for public policies in changing that.\n\nBarriers such as the cost of childcare and housing, financial instability, persistent gender inequality, inflexible working conditions, and a lack of job security are among the factors holding people back from having more children.\n\nBetter policies may not be able to close the gap completely, but they can help. “Supportive family policies — such as accessible childcare, financial incentives, and cultural acceptance of working parents — can significantly impact demographic trends,” Rehn said.\n\nExperts agree. “Conventional pro-natal policy that is chucking money at the problem works to an extent,” said Lyman Stone, demographer at the Institute of Family Studies, who specialises in fertility.\n\nStone said studies showed South Korean fertility rates could be even lower than they are now without baby bonus programmes, the expansion of state-funded childcare, subsidised fertility treatments and housing assistance.\n\nAt the same time, Finland remains one of the world’s most rapidly ageing societies thanks to a big baby boom after the second world war. Neither cheap childcare, nor “baby money” paid out by dozens of municipalities, appear to have had much impact on the country’s birth rate, which remains among Europe’s lowest.\n\nAihio said that good local services — such as libraries, swimming pools and decent childcare — seemed more important than money in encouraging women to have babies. And Rehn acknowledged that policies could take a “long time” to show any pay-off.\n\nSome governments have also faced criticism for how they target measures to encourage people to become parents. In Italy, for example — where the fertility rate stands at a modest 1.2 — only heterosexual, married women are allowed to undergo in vitro fertilisation, even privately. Single women and those in same-sex partnerships are denied access.\n\nAnother “huge headache for policymakers”, said Paula Sheppard, evolutionary anthropologist at Oxford university, was that different parts of the population needed different policies.\n\nWomen with low levels of education delay having children because of concerns about the stability of their relationships and the need to live near their parents. By contrast, those with a university education worry about dropping down the career ladder and want a hands-on partner, her research has suggested.\n\nOthers studying the challenge of old-age dependency ratios argue there is no need to focus policy changes primarily on births.\n\nEdward Paice, a demographics expert focusing on Africa, said there was an obvious answer to the west’s demographic problems: immigration. “Europe can’t hermetically seal itself anyway. There are tremendous opportunities for western countries to rethink how they engage with African countries,” he said.\n\nAn influx of foreigners has slowly but steadily increased Finland’s population in recent years. But while Rehn acknowledged that work- and education-related immigration was “an essential part of the solution”, he added: “Of course, in the age of populism this is a politically challenging message.”\n\nGovernments also want people to work for longer. Harper, the professor of gerontology, said it was important for societies to acknowledge that retiring from the workforce and then expecting to live on social support for decades afterwards was “just not sustainable”.\n\nLike immigration, raising the retirement age can come at a steep political cost.\n\nIn France in 2023, people took to the streets in protest as President Emmanuel Macron rammed through legislation to raise the retirement age from 62 to just 64. Many Chinese have reacted angrily to legislation to raise statutory retirement ages, which are some of the world’s lowest.\n\n“You can either increase migration rates or retirement age, or encourage people to have more children,” said Edward Davies, policy director at the Centre for Social Justice in the UK. “I suspect of the three, people naturally would like to have families, whereas actually telling them they have to retire later or you have to have mass migration — it’s probably just less popular.”\n\nAdditional reporting by David Pilling in London\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nHow global demography resembles a Ponzi scheme / From Eric Filseth, Palo Alto, CA, US",

    "body": "We’ve already spent a lot of time gawping at the vanishing spread between Japanese and Chinese government bond yields, and its myriad implications.\n\nWell, here’s another fixed income spread that says something interesting about the global economy today. Or at least something interesting about how investors see the global economy today.\n\nLo, the spread between India and China’s 10 year sovereign bond yields hit an 11-year high of 5.2 percentage points earlier this month, and remains near its highest ever levels.\n\nThe recent ballooning is mostly due to Chinese yields grinding lower and lower. Indian yields have actually fallen as well lately, due to expectations for rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of India, the surging US dollar, and last year’s inclusion into JPMorgan’s influential emerging market bond indices.\n\nHowever, the economic outlook for India is lot more positive than it is for China. As a result, the inflation picture is also radically different, as Chetan Ahya, chief Asia economist at Morgan Stanley points out:\n\nTrinh Nguyen, economist for emerging Asia at Natixis, adds that India has some tailwinds that China now lacks:\n\nAs a result, Indian bond yields have remained relatively high — the 10-year yield has dipped from above 7 per cent in the middle of 2024 to around 6.7 per cent right now — even as Chinese bond yields have puked hard.\n\nIn fact, the 10-year Chinese government bond yield is now only a whisker above 1.5 per cent, a figurative fixed income market howl that there’s a danger that deflation becomes entrenched.\n\nIn a sign of how serious the situation is for China, its 30-year yield fell below that of Japan’s last year, and China’s 10-year government bond yield is now only 0.4 percentage point higher than that of Japan.\n\nThe United Nations predicts that India will remain the fastest growing major economy in the world, forecasting GDP growth of 6.6 per cent in 2025, even Chinese economic growth slows to 4.8 per cent.\n\nThe whole India versus China thing seems to be becoming a bit of a narrative, with UBS recently releasing a 139-page tome that compares the two countries across a range of different macro and capital market metrics. Most notably, the report predicts that India could overtake China in MSCI’s equity weightings by as early as 2028.\n\nOf course, it wasn’t that long ago that people were just as bullish on China . . .",

    "blurb": "Hyatt, IHG and Radisson are expanding in China but shifting focus to more cost-conscious travellers",
    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "International hotel groups are increasing their presence in China, betting on the cheaper end of the market as the country’s economic slowdown hurts travellers’ budgets.\n\nHyatt, IHG and Radisson are among the global hotel chains expanding in the world’s second-biggest economy — and converting some of the many unoccupied office blocks to hotels — as they look to target younger, more cost-conscious travellers.\n\nHyatt, the US hospitality group known for upmarket brands such as Grand Hyatt and Hyatt Regency, has about 170 of its more than 1,300 hotels in China. It plans to add another 140 in the next four years, about half of which will be part of the mid-range UrCove brand.\n\nUrCove charges about $60 a night on average for rooms in its 50-plus hotels in China, about half the cost of a night in some of the Hyatt Regency’s nearly 40 hotels in the country.\n\nHyatt’s focus on UrCove, a joint development with Chinese hotel chain BTG Homeinns, would allow it to expand into more cities and “grow our base”, including for young domestic travellers, said Stephen Ho, who runs Hyatt’s greater China business.\n\nWith Chinese companies cutting costs and trimming travel budgets, demand for expensive hotel rooms had fallen sharply in recent months, said Zhou Mingqi, founder of China-based consultancy Jingjian Consulting, which specialises in tourism and real estate.\n\n“[Many] Chinese are more cautious on spending in a slower economy [but are still pursuing] quality,” said Ernan Cui, a consumer market analyst at Gavekal. “As a result, mid-to-upscale hotels are favoured and would see stronger growth than [high-end luxury hotels].”\n\nSome hoteliers are renting and converting empty office blocks into affordable hotels. Seven of Hyatt’s UrCove hotels in the tech hub of Shenzhen were converted from empty floors in existing office buildings, said Ho.\n\n“[We] can convert office space, even residential space, sometimes existing buildings . . . [and] reconfigure it into a hotel,” he said. “Most of the time they only have one restaurant, [limited] meeting space and no swimming pool . . . so it makes it easier to convert [from] an office space.\n\n“It’s a worthwhile investment,” he added. “You don’t have to build the building, you don’t have to buy the land, right?”\n\nDaniel Aylmer, chief executive at IHG Greater China, said “over half of our open and pipeline hotels” in the greater China region — which includes the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan — would fall under two of its mid-range brands, Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express.\n\nHe added there had been a “ramp-up in recent years” of conversions from existing buildings, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of its openings in greater China in the first half of last year. The group said mid-range hotels were experiencing “substantial” growth in China as “consumer behaviours evolve”.\n\nBelgium-based Radisson, which was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Jin Jiang International in 2018, said it was planning about 400 new hotels in China by 2030, including a large number of mid-range rooms.\n\nSome of its new hotels would be converted from office buildings, said Elie Younes, Radisson’s global chief development officer. “People in secondary cities are spending less in China, so I have to afford to build the hotel that the customer can afford,” he said.\n\nAverage room rates at luxury and upscale hotels in China were down by up to 20 per cent in October compared with the previous year, said Rao Linfeng, a China-based hotel investment strategist. Overall room rates are still growing but at a slower pace this year as the post-pandemic travel demand surge loses steam and economic growth remains slow.\n\nThe decline in consumer spending at China’s luxury hotels was “evident”, said Harlem Chow, a former executive at H World and Wyndham. “Former five-star hotel guests now choose four-star options, while four-star guests turn to upper mid-range hotels.” Guests were also opting for cheaper brands and having fewer overnight stays, said Chow.\n\nAs international hotel groups target the more cost-conscious traveller, they face increased domestic competition.\n\nGroups such as H World and Atour were also investing in mid-range hotels, said Kevin Hei, business development manager at Empark Hotels & Resorts.\n\nThe higher-end market was “unlikely to see a strong rebound any time soon”, said Zhou of Jingjian Consulting, adding that international brands would increasingly see thin margins. “Ultimately, they’ll have to compete just as aggressively as local brands do.”",

    "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Until this month, the oil-rich United Arab Emirates had modest ambitions when it came to renewable energy: to install roughly as many solar panels each year as the UK.\n\nBut then Masdar, the country’s state-owned renewable energy company, decided to make a splash at a huge trade fair in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn front of the UAE president, it announced it would build a $6bn 5 gigawatt solar plant backed with more than 19GWh of battery storage — the largest such project ever attempted.\n\nWhen it starts in two years’ time, its batteries will give the country a constant output of 1GW, enough to power more than 700,000 homes without having to rely on gas-fired plants when the sun is not shining.\n\n“This will transform renewable energy into baseload energy,” said Sultan Al Jaber, the chair of Masdar. “It is a first step that could become a giant leap.”\n\nAs the UAE was revealing its new solar project, Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, announced a joint venture that would start producing lithium, a key ingredient for batteries, as early as 2027.\n\nThe two countries, and their neighbours in the Gulf, have always been able to rely on their abundant reserves of fossil fuels, and both Saudi Arabia and the UAE plan to produce significantly more oil and gas in the years ahead.\n\nBut the Gulf is also accelerating its use of renewable energy, spying an economic opportunity to use cheap solar panels, wind turbines and batteries for its domestic electricity, and freeing up more oil and gas for export.\n\n“The perfect recipe [for renewable energy] exists here,” said Mazin Khan, Masdar’s chief financial officer, adding that the cost of the new solar and battery plant would be, for the first time, “comparable, if not cheaper, than conventional gas”.\n\n“We have abundant solar resources. We have relationships with manufacturers that we can leverage to get the best price possible. The regulatory market here in the UAE is very competitive and we have a line of commercial banks queueing up to be part of the project.”\n\nThe most active companies bidding for contracts to build renewable projects in the Gulf are regional players including Masdar and Saudi Arabia’s Acwa Power, Asian companies such as South Korea’s Kepco, Japan’s Jera and China’s Jinko Power, and Europe’s TotalEnergies, EDF and Engie.\n\nThe wider Middle East, including Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, is far behind Europe, the US and China in using renewable energy.\n\nAccording to the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena), the Middle East has less than 1 per cent of the world’s renewable capacity. But from a low base, it is also the fastest-growing region outside China, in terms of adding capacity.\n\nWith a series of huge projects, the Gulf is rapidly changing its energy mix. In five years’ time, renewables will make 30 per cent of the total capacity across Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, according to data from Rystad, an energy consultancy.\n\n“They have a lot of capital now from oil and gas, and they are trying to become less reliant on any one source of energy,” said Vegard Wiik Vollset, head of renewables at Rystad.\n\n“It is also an economic benefit because they already have the best conditions for solar of almost anywhere in the world, and if you can get cheaper electricity than it costs for gas, you can export the gas instead.”\n\nRystad’s projections are based on multiple new project announcements across the region, but the energy consultancy also adjusts its forecast to take into account that the Gulf’s ambitions appear to be running ahead of reality.\n\nSaudi Arabia, for example, targets to generate 50 per cent of its electricity from renewables by 2030, requiring it to install 130GW of renewables in just a few years, enough to power about 25mn homes. “They will have to ramp up their efforts quite substantially,” said Vollset.\n\n“2030 is quite soon. Of course, in the Middle East the turnaround can be very quick, like the UAE project. That timeline would never happen in Europe and North America.”\n\nThe drive for renewables is also being fed by ambitions to build AI data centres and fledgling plans to produce “green” hydrogen — a transition fuel that is electrolysed using renewable power — and export it to countries where higher power prices make its production uncompetitive.\n\nKuwait, which only had enough renewable capacity to power a few thousand homes at the end of 2023, according to Irena, awarded a contract in July last year to US engineering firm KBR to create 17GW of renewables, or enough energy for about 500,000 homes, and 25GW of green hydrogen capacity by 2050.\n\nMost of the suppliers of green products are Chinese. At this month’s trade fair, dozens of the country’s leading manufacturers crammed into Abu Dhabi’s National Exhibition Centre, showing off a range of products customised for the local market, such as self-cleaning solar arrays, with robots that brush away dust and sand to keep panels running efficiently.\n\n“Our batteries can withstand temperatures of over 60C, and they are sand, water and wind resistant,” said Yong Liu, a marketing executive at BYD, one of China’s leading battery and electric car companies.\n\nBYD provided the batteries for Saudi Arabia’s Bisha plant, which until the UAE’s announcement, was the world’s largest solar and battery project.\n\n“Business is growing very fast here and the projects are huge,” said Beijing Hyperstrong, a well-established Chinese battery company. “It is a new emerging market for us. While we already set up a presence in Europe and the US, the Middle East is equally important for us in the long run.”\n\nHowever, the challenge will be for Gulf states to integrate a rapid rollout of renewables into their power grids, said Vollset. “What they do not currently have is the infrastructure, in terms of the grid, which is built for fossil fuels, not solar power. So there’s a question mark over how they overcome that obstacle.”\n\nData visualisation by Will Crofton in London",

    "body": "It is hard to talk about 21st-century economic history without discussing the “China shock”. That is the term often used to describe China’s entrance into the global market, a change that brought rich countries an abundance of cheap goods, but left entire industries and workforces mothballed.\n\nDeepSeek may provide a sequel. A little-known Chinese hedge fund has thrown a grenade into the world of artificial intelligence with a large language model that, in effect, matches the market leader, Sam Altman’s OpenAI, at a fraction of the cost. And while OpenAI treats its models’ workings as proprietary, DeepSeek’s R1 wears its technical innards on the outside, making it attractive for developers to use and build on.\n\nThings move faster in the AI age; terrifyingly so. Five of the biggest technology stocks geared to AI — chipmaker Nvidia and so-called hyperscalers Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms — collectively shed almost $750bn of market value before US markets opened on Monday. It could be particularly grim for Nvidia if it proves true that DeepSeek won without the use of its shiniest chips.\n\nInvestors in tech companies, including Europeans such as chipmaking equipment maker ASML, and energy companies that investors hoped would get a boost from fuelling data centres, are left wondering whether their investments will go up in smoke. The hyperscalers were due to plough almost $300bn into capital expenditure this year, according to Visible Alpha estimates. Analysts expect that on Wednesday, when they report earnings, Meta and Microsoft will report investment for 2024 totalling $94bn.\n\nIn truth, the game is not over. DeepSeek’s actual potential is still unclear, and it has yet to achieve “artificial general intelligence”, the humanlike state that Meta and OpenAI are pursuing. But the rules might have changed. At the very least, DeepSeek may take some of the US giants’ customers. At worst, it has challenged the core belief that more hardware is the key to better AI. That principle has underpinned the market value of Silicon Valley companies as they invest hand over fist.\n\nWhat is bad for the hyperscalers could still be a windfall for everyone else. For most business users, having the absolute best model is less important than having one that’s reliable and good enough. Not every driver needs a Ferrari. Advances in reasoning such as R1 could be a big step for “agents” that deal with customers and perform tasks in the workplace. If those are available more cheaply, corporate profitability should rise.\n\nIn that sense, this second China shock could resemble the first. It could bring not just destruction but a reshuffling — albeit a painful one for many. Researchers have estimated that for every job lost to the China shock, US households’ purchasing power rose by more than $400,000. The race for AI supremacy is on pause; the great giveaway has begun.\n\njohn.foley@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nEnjoyable serendipity / From Stuart Dawkins, Leicester, Leicestershire, UK",

    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Leading Chinese property developer Vanke has forecast a $6.2bn annual loss and announced the sudden resignation of its top leadership, reigniting concerns over funding and confidence across China’s economically critical real estate sector.\n\nThe developer, partly owned by local authorities in Shenzhen, is the latest focal point of a cash crunch that began with the collapse of peer Evergrande in 2021 and has since engulfed a host of other developers including Country Garden.\n\nAfter weeks of swirling concerns over the health of Vanke, the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday that chair Yu Liang had resigned for “work adjustment reasons”. It said chief executive Zhu Jiusheng had departed for “health reasons”.\n\nThe “sudden and simultaneous” resignations were “unprecedented in recent memory” for a big participant such as Vanke, said Foreky Wong, founding partner at Hong Kong advisory company Fortune Ark Restructuring.\n\nVanke said in a separate filing that it expected to have made a loss of Rmb45bn ($6.2bn) in 2024, compared with profits of Rmb12bn a year earlier, highlighting a continued decline in sales of new homes in China. The company said it was experiencing “temporary liquidity difficulties” due to the loss.\n\nXin Jie, head of Shenzhen Metro, which owns about a third of Vanke, will become the company’s new chair. Vanke is now set to become the latest test of authorities’ willingness to support individual developers, which typically borrow heavily to finance their activities. Vanke has Rmb36bn of capital market debt coming due this year.\n\nGiven the company’s well-known status in China, its struggles also pose a fresh challenge to homebuyer confidence, which remains weak despite a barrage of recent efforts from policymakers.\n\nRather than carrying out individual bailouts, Beijing has, since Evergrande’s default in 2021, prioritised completing unfinished projects, reducing borrowing costs for homeowners and encouraging banks and other lenders to refinance the sector.\n\nPolicymakers unveiled vast credit lines from state-owned banks in late 2022 and, in May, announced a new policy of encouraging state-owned enterprises to buy unsold housing. However, overall investment and sales have continued to decline, weighing on China’s economic momentum.\n\nZerlina Zeng, head of Asia credit strategy at CreditSights, said the crucial question was how much contagion risk Vanke’s plight would create, adding that the central and local governments might not be expecting “so much of a systemic impact” from a restructuring.\n\n“If the market thinks otherwise and we see a funding freeze . . . and that leads to banks becoming even less willing to extend money to property, even at the project level, then that would [mean] big trouble for the Chinese government,” she said.\n\nThe resignations at Vanke come after a period of mounting concern over its liquidity, echoing the experience of other developers such as Country Garden in 2023. Leading rating agencies had downgraded its debt in recent weeks.\n\nFitch, which downgraded its debt to B minus last week, pointing to a “deterioration in Vanke’s sales and cash generation”, saying it was now reliant on new bank borrowing and asset disposals to repay its looming debts.\n\nZeng said the Shenzhen government had over the past year “not provided much liquidity and financial support to Vanke”, and that the cash required was “not something that a local government, even a wealthy one, would be able to [provide]”.",

    "body": "Tesla is suing the EU over tariffs the bloc imposed on imports of electric vehicles from China, in the latest confrontation between the carmaker’s billionaire boss Elon Musk and Brussels.\n\nThe European Court of Justice published confirmation of the case, filed by Tesla’s Shanghai subsidiary, on its website on Monday without giving further details.\n\nTesla’s lawsuit follows similar claims filed by Germany’s BMW and several Chinese carmakers.\n\nIn October the EU imposed anti-subsidy tariffs of up to 7.8 per cent for Tesla and up to 35.3 per cent on other Chinese electric vehicle imports produced by other carmakers. They were in addition to a 10 per cent standard import tariff for the industry.\n\nThe anti-subsidy tariffs came after an EU investigation launched in 2023 on China’s unfair support for its EV industry. Brussels found that carmakers had benefited from soft loans, cheap land deals and subsidies for suppliers such as steelmakers.\n\nAbout a fifth of all electric cars sold across the EU last year, or 300,000 units, were built in China. Tesla accounted for 28 per cent of Chinese-made EVs imported into the bloc in 2023, more than any other brand, according to Transport and Environment, an environmental NGO.\n\nTesla was hit with the lowest tariff after an individual examination by the EU found that it received the smallest amount of support from the Chinese government.\n\nTesla executives have said they are adjusting their import policy from China to respond to the EU tariffs. The company currently exports Model 3 vehicles from Shanghai to the EU, while it produces the Model Y in Berlin.\n\nThe legal filing gave no details about Tesla’s argument. The case against the European Commission will be heard at the General Court, the EU’s second-highest court, and the verdict can be appealed against to the ECJ. The process could take about 18 months.\n\nEuropean Commission trade spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday in response to Tesla’s filing: “We’re prepared to defend our case in court as necessary.”\n\nMusk, an adviser to US President Donald Trump and an outspoken critic of EU technology regulation, has backed the far-right Alternative for Germany party in the country’s election campaign.\n\nNew Tesla registrations fell 13 per cent year on year to 242,945 vehicles in 2024, according to Acea, the European car industry body. Musk’s political activism has been blamed for deterring some drivers from buying a Tesla, though it has made others more likely to buy one.",

    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chinese regulators are investigating the quality of domestic generic drugs after a rare public backlash against a cost-cutting campaign that prioritised their use in the national healthcare system but has led to doctors complaining about their effectiveness.\n\nThe probe comes amid increasing concerns among foreign pharmaceutical companies that China’s drug procurement system, in which producers bid for bulk tenders to supply public hospitals, in effect discriminates against international competition.\n\nChina’s pharmaceuticals market is one of the most important for drug companies, second in size only to the US, with sales of $239bn in 2023, according to a report by research group Frost & Sullivan.\n\nBut healthcare costs in the country have soared, and Chinese policymakers have sought for years to revamp the medical insurance system and rein in prices. In 2018, they began rolling out a centralised drug procurement scheme, replacing a fragmented system in which hospitals negotiated individually for medical supplies.\n\nThe programme drove down costs, with the average price of some medications falling more than 50 per cent. But some of those discounts came from replacing more expensive, off-patent drugs from companies such as AstraZeneca and GSK with cheaper domestic alternatives. Patients and doctors have expressed concerns about the effectiveness of some domestic generics.\n\nIn a rare public complaint on January 16, Zheng Minhua, a senior surgeon at Shanghai’s Ruijin Hospital, and 19 other prominent doctors, said it was an “undeniable fact” that domestic drugs showed poor efficacy with their patients, even when dosages were increased.\n\n“Hypertension does not drop effectively, anaesthetics do not put patients to sleep and laxatives do not cause diarrhoea,” they wrote in a policy proposal submitted to Shanghai’s municipal legislature and seen by the Financial Times. “Questionable drug efficacy poses the greatest safety risk to patients,” they added.\n\nThe doctors called for “greater flexibility” in drug contract bidding to have western brand-named drugs covered by insurance.\n\nGrowing public anger prompted the National Healthcare Security Administration to dispatch a team to Shanghai last Tuesday to examine hospital data on domestic generic prescriptions, according to a statement.\n\nThe issue of medical safety is especially sensitive in China, where past scandals over tainted infant formula and blood transfusions that had proven deadly stoked public outrage over lax regulations.\n\nChinese patients can still purchase some foreign drugs online, but they are not covered by insurance, and doctors usually do not provide advice on non-approved medication. In the procurement process for Shanghai’s public health system last month, more than 20 foreign brands including Pfizer, Bayer and MSD sent bids for 32 off-patent drugs. None were selected.\n\nForeign companies have also become increasingly vocal about lack of access to China’s drugs and medical devices market.\n\nThe European Union Chamber of Commerce in China told the FT it “would closely monitor” the probe, adding that it hoped “to see steps taken to ensure that the procurement system for drugs does not prioritise low prices at the expense of product safety and clinical outcomes”.\n\nAmerican Chamber of Commerce in China president Michael Hart said: “If companies can’t sell and make a reasonable profit in China, they won’t offer their products and services to China. And we think that would be to the detriment of the healthcare market.”\n\nOne nurse who works in an operating room at a top hospital in Shanghai expressed concerns that domestic medical devices were often inferior to foreign competitors.\n\n“Items like tumour removal forceps may look identical to imported ones, [but] during precise operations, domestic tools often fail to grip properly,” they said, adding that there were cases of patients “waking up during surgeries” after taking domestically produced anaesthetics.\n\nJumbo, a 35-year-old lecturer in Shanghai who preferred to be identified by one name, was prescribed a Chinese antiviral drug at a public hospital for chickenpox last year.\n\nBut the virus spread aggressively, and her own research led her to believe the drug’s active ingredient was far less effective than imported alternatives such as GSK’s Valtrex. She doubled her dosage without consulting her doctor.\n\n“I understand why hospitals prescribe domestic drugs, but I’m willing to pay for more expensive foreign medications,” Jumbo said. “Patients need all available treatment options and the healthcare system should not block us from another path.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Wang Xueqiao in Shanghai",

    "body": "Volkswagen is open to allowing Chinese carmakers to take over its excess production lines in Europe, as it grapples with falling demand and rising competition from the very same companies eyeing its factories.\n\nExecutives at Audi and VW’s eponymous flagship brand told the Financial Times that partnering with Chinese makers of EVs, which are looking to expand their footprint in Europe, was one option to address declining sales in the region.\n\n“For sure, that is thinkable,” said Gernot Döllner, chief executive of Audi. Such a move would “lower the entrance barrier of these competitors”, adding: “I believe in free trade.”\n\nAudi has partnered with MG-maker SAIC to build EVs in China that appeal to local consumers — a type of collaboration that Döllner said Chinese brands might also seek to recreate in Europe.\n\nIn a separate interview, David Powels, chief financial officer at the VW brand, would also not rule out the idea of Chinese carmakers taking over idle production lines at the company’s German plants.\n\n“We’re open for any discussion on any topic with any partner,” he said. “In a dynamic world, you have to keep all options open.”\n\nThe comments come as Europe’s legacy carmakers race to shift to EVs, a segment where Chinese brands such as BYD are producing what are considered more technologically advanced vehicles, helped both by subsidies from Beijing and a lower cost base.\n\nFor decades, China was VW’s most profitable market but in the past five years, the market share of its flagship brand has nearly halved due to its weak position in the rapidly growing battery-run vehicle market.\n\nEurope’s largest carmaker has also been hit hard by the shrinking automotive market in its home region, where 2mn fewer cars were sold last year compared with five years earlier.\n\nLast month, VW reached an agreement with workers at its flagship brand to scale back production capacity across Germany, avoiding a more drastic plan that would have involved closing at least three plants in the country.\n\nThe closure of production lines means that the VW brand — which accounts for roughly half of the group’s sales by volume — was set to reduce its annual capacity by roughly 730,000 cars from about 1.5mn by 2030, the carmaker said.\n\nExcess capacity started to rise during the pandemic when VW began cancelling night shifts due to lower demand, with the brand producing about 900,000 cars in Germany in 2024.\n\nVW’s plants will have to reach new undisclosed productivity targets to fight for remaining capacity, and those unable to meet them will be considered for “alternative use” — which could include being put up for sale.\n\nSome Chinese carmakers see using excess production capacity in Europe as a way to enhance their presence in the bloc.\n\nStellantis, for example, has taken a 20 per cent stake in Chinese start-up Leapmotor, giving it exclusive rights to build and sell Leapmotor cars outside China through a joint venture. If Leapmotor sales grow in Europe, Stellantis could utilise more spare capacity at its own factories and avoid politically controversial closures.\n\nDöllner said Audi was also opposed to the EU’s higher tariffs on Chinese-imported EVs, saying the protectionist measures would ultimately hurt its position.\n\nChina remains a crucial market for many non-Chinese carmakers, while several companies manufacture vehicles in the country and then import them back into Europe.\n\n“Tariffs will only block [competition] for some time and give you a wrong [sense of] security. We have to keep pace,” Döllner added.",

    "blurb": "Risk of a systemic financial event stemming from bank purchases of the country’s bonds is low, analysts say",
    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s bond market is sending alarm signals over the state of the economy, as its central bank uses financial heft and brash warnings to battle deflationary pressures.\n\nThe country’s benchmark 10-year sovereign yield has fallen from more than 2.5 per cent at the start of last January to about 1.6 per cent at the beginning of 2025, sparking warnings of “Japanification”, in which the economy suffers a protracted period of deflation and sluggishness.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China has repeatedly expressed concern over regional banks buying up its government bonds in the past year, and sending the country’s borrowing costs plunging — in a mirror image of what has happened in western debt markets over the past months.\n\nIn a statement in April, the PBoC warned that China risked Silicon Valley Bank-style bank runs if its financial sector continued to purchase long-dated sovereign bonds.\n\nThen, in August, the bank named and shamed four rural commercial banks for “manipulating sovereign bond prices in the secondary market” — a move that was seen as a warning to other banks. At the same time, people close to the central bank told the Financial Times that its plans to issue billions of dollars of fresh government debt and special bonds threatened to burst a bubble that it said had formed in the market.\n\nThis month, the PBoC won a rare reprieve from the market after it announced it would cease its programme of treasury purchases indefinitely after five months. During that time, the central bank had bought a net $1tn worth of bonds, sending yields up slightly.\n\nBut analysts say the risk of a systemic financial event stemming from this purchasing Chinese government bonds is low, given the lack of parallels with Silicon Valley Bank. In 2023, SAB had put an abnormally large proportion of its assets into US Treasury bonds without hedging the interest rate exposure.\n\nIt was one of several US banks left sitting on big paper losses as the long-dated bonds they had bought and held without interest rate hedges fell in price, after the US Federal Reserve raised rates more than 5 per cent between 2022 and 2023. Bond yields move inversely to prices. This triggered a crisis as SVB’s depositors — principally start-ups — were sophisticated clients with a need for cash.\n\nI think the concern over something similar to SVB should not be too high because, in China, the regulator and the government are always very proactive in stepping in to provide support to financial institutions,” explains May Yan, head of Asia financials at UBS investment bank. “They wouldn’t wait for days for a bank run to occur.\n\n“A bank run could happen at any time or, if you overinvest in low-rate assets, it becomes problematic when the central bank hikes rates rapidly,” Yan notes. “However, no one anticipates such a swift rate increase in China any time soon.”\n\nThe other concern raised by Chinese authorities — that a massive bond issuance, as may be necessary for the government to launch a fiscal stimulus, could lead to a spike in yields — has also been dismissed by some economists.\n\n“A huge amount of bond issuance will only be done if it mirrors a weak economy due to too high private savings,” says Allan von Mehren, chief China economist at Danske Bank. “Those savings need a home and bonds would be one of them — as is the case today.”\n\nVon Mehren adds that, even in the case of a stronger economy, in which investors switch from bonds to equities, a big move downwards in bond prices would most likely be met with intervention from authorities “to stabilise markets in that case”.\n\nGlobal investors have largely brushed off the warnings from the PBoC and continued to hold Chinese government bonds as an investment, believing that their prices will rise more, sending yields further down.\n\n“Chinese bonds were among the standout performers in local emerging markets in 2024, rewarding holders with falling yields despite rising yields globally,” points out Marcelo Assalin, head of William Blair Investment Management’s emerging markets debt team. There is still a case for Chinese bond yields to fall further given attractive real yields in higher duration bonds, the disinflationary path, and concerns around the potential for deflation.”\n\nMark Evans, emerging markets fixed income portfolio manager at asset manager Ninety One, is also a holder. He says: “We have been overweight for some time and remain overweight”. In his view, “real rates remain attractive” and bond prices have continued to rise despite an increased expectation of issuance to come.\n\nBut investors reject the idea that China’s sovereign bond yields could decline all the way to 0 per cent, as Japan experienced in the past decade, cementing the risks of stagnant growth and deflationary pressures.\n\n“We expect Chinese government stimulus to be more aggressive and more effective in 2025, placing a floor on what are already low levels of yield on an absolute level,” says Assalin.",

The measure, which tracks companies with more than Rmb20mn ($2.8mn) in turnover, has fallen in each of the past three years.\n\nThe new figures will add to pressure on China’s policymakers, who are grappling with a property slowdown now in its fourth year, a loss of consumer confidence, the threat of entrenched deflation and resurgent trade tensions with the US under Donald Trump.\n\nOfficial data released this month showed China’s economy grew 5.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, meeting an annual growth target of 5 per cent, which was the joint lowest in decades. But much of that growth was thanks to industrial output and exports, which offset weakness in the property and retail sectors.\n\nBeijing unveiled measures in September to boost the stock market and lower mortgage rates and has previously encouraged state-owned enterprises to buy up unsold housing stock. But economists have called for more direct fiscal support to boost consumption.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping called for “vigorous” efforts to boost domestic demand after an annual economic conference for party leaders in December.\n\nThis month, policymakers expanded a programme to trade in old goods, such as home appliances, for new ones. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the trade-in programme helped increase nominal household consumption growth to 4.5 per cent in the last three months of the year, from 3.5 per cent in the previous quarter, based on an NBS household survey.\n\nChina this year also faces the prospect of renewed trade disruption following Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nStrong exports last year helped drive China to a record trade surplus of close to $1tn, but Trump has pledged to impose higher tariffs on Chinese goods, and forecasts show weaker or in some cases no export growth this year.\n\nZhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said part of the slowdown in the PMI data “may be due to weaker external demand, as the new export orders index dropped to the lowest level since March last year”.\n\nChina’s official non-manufacturing PMI gauge, which includes services, was 50.2 in January, remaining in expansionary territory but registering much slower growth than the reading of 52.2 in December.",

    "blurb": "Taipei’s move reflects concern Beijing could use vessels that evade international oversight against it",
    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Taiwan has drawn up a blacklist of 52 Chinese-owned ships that use flags of convenience, which it will track and proactively inspect in an effort to regulate part of a rapidly growing “shadow fleet” that is causing global security concerns.\n\nThe move comes amid explosive growth in the number of ageing vessels that evade oversight and hide their identity with deceptive signalling.\n\nWhile international attention has focused on Russia’s use of this shadow fleet to export oil in circumvention of sanctions over its war on Ukraine, the ranks of such ships have swelled beyond tankers and pose increasing maritime and national security risks to coastal states.\n\nTaipei launched its crackdown after a dilapidated Chinese-owned freighter was suspected of cutting one of its subsea cables this month, following similar incidents involving Chinese and Russian-owned ships in the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe tighter inspection regime targets cargo ships sailing under the flags of Cameroon, Tanzania, Mongolia, Togo and Sierra Leone whose owner companies are registered in mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau, according to the blacklist seen by the Financial Times.\n\n“The cable-cutting incident reminded us of the risks posed by substandard vessels,” said a Taiwan coastguard official. “It is a risk to all coastal states, and we must fulfil our responsibility as a port state. Moreover, we face an additional risk from China.”\n\nBeijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and threatens to annex it by force if Taipei resists unification indefinitely. Since China often includes commercial ships in military exercises and uses fishing vessels as militia to assert disputed maritime claims, Taiwanese officials fear Chinese-owned ships could be used as part of “greyzone” operations that fall below the threshold of outright war.\n\nCameroon, Tanzania, Mongolia, Togo and Sierra Leone are among dozens of states that allow ship owners to register their ships without being domiciled in the country. Ship owners often choose such flags of convenience to avoid higher costs, stricter safety standards and more stringent oversight in their own nations.\n\nTaipei is focusing on those five countries because vessels from their flag register top the ranking of vessels found to have faulty documentation, by violating maritime safety or labour regulations or circumventing sanctions, according to the Tokyo MOU, a multilateral grouping for port state control in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nDue to opposition from Beijing, Taiwan is not a member of the Tokyo MOU but received the organisation’s list of problematic ships “through channels”, one official said. It then “whittled down” that list by selecting those with owners of a China background.\n\nThe Taiwanese government has marked 15 of the 52 ships as posing a threat to the country because they lingered in its territorial waters for 15 days or more over the past year. Among those, the vessel suspected of cutting the cable was defined as posing a “high threat”, four others a “medium threat” and 10 more “some threat”, according to the blacklist.\n\nOn Thursday, the coastguard boarded and inspected the Bao Shun, a 20-year-old Mongolia-flagged freighter owned by a Hong Kong-registered company, in what was the first use of the new regulatory approach.\n\nThe ship had been idling close to Taiwan for two months and is one of those identified as a medium threat. A person close to the Maritime and Port Bureau said that in the past the port regulator would only carry out spot checks of vessels coming into port.\n\nThe inspection did not turn up invalid documents, contraband cargo or cable-cutting equipment on board. But the coastguard instructed it to leave Taiwanese waters. As of Sunday, it was drifting 27 nautical miles outside Kaohsiung, the country’s largest port. The owner of the Bao Shun could not be reached for comment.\n\nOn January 3, a subsea communications cable owned by a global telecoms consortium was severed just off the north coast of Taiwan. Taiwan’s government identified the Cameroon-flagged freighter Shunxing39, which had been criss-crossing the area where several regional and transpacific cables land for at least a month, as the likely suspect.\n\nAccording to an FT analysis of tracking data from three different providers, the vessel’s real name is Xing Shun 39 and it is registered in Tanzania, but it has used several different identities over the past year.\n\nIn the weeks before the incident, it alternated between two different maritime mobile service identities, or MMSI numbers, broadcast from its automatic identification system (AIS). Over the past year, it has appeared under three different names, for one of which it used three different spellings, and four different MMSIs. It also briefly assumed the identity of a separate ship.\n\n“In the normal, above-board shipping world, such deceptive practices would be unheard of, but it would be a common tactic to manipulate the AIS if you are doing something that you don’t want to be seen,” said Bridget Diakun, a maritime risk analyst at Lloyd’s List, the London-based shipping information provider.\n\nThe owner of the Xing Shun 39 could not be reached for comment.\n\nTaiwanese national security officials said the number of ships meeting the criteria for “shadow vessels” that were operating in regional waters had ballooned over the past two years.\n\nAccording to Taiwan coastguard and port officials, the vessels mostly transport frozen food and miscellaneous small cargo, often relying on smaller shuttles that transfer the cargo at sea.\n\n“Their business model is to use the lowest cost possible by avoiding regular repairs and rarely going into port,” one of the port officials said.\n\nAnalysts said those observations reflected a steep increase in shadow vessels globally.\n\n“Since Russia started using the shadow fleet to ship oil in violation of sanctions, the barrier of respectability has been broken,” said Elisabeth Braw, a maritime security expert at the Atlantic Council.\n\n“Russia has shown that you can operate vessels in violation of international regulations without consequences,” Braw said. “Ordinarily when your vessel reaches retirement age, you pay to have it scrapped. But instead of doing that, ship owners now get paid by sending it into the shadow fleet.”",

    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Hong Kong is setting its sights on a $20bn listings revival this year as it aims to exploit worsening US-China tensions and the sluggish mainland Chinese equity market.\n\nInvestment banks in Hong Kong are expecting a rush of listed Chinese companies, led by battery maker CATL, to set up a secondary listing in the offshore territory. These “A to H” listings — from mainland China’s “A” shares to Hong Kong — could raise as much as $20bn in new funds, said bankers.\n\nA replenished pipeline would mark a sharp pick-up in activity for Hong Kong, which has lost some high-profile international companies such as cosmetics company L’Occitane and struggled to replace them.\n\nMany of the Chinese companies turning to Hong Kong have extensive overseas operations and want to raise funds outside the mainland, as Beijing tightens capital leaving the country. Geopolitical tensions between China and the US have made listings in New York, another common pathway for Chinese companies, far less appealing.\n\n“The Hong Kong market will bounce back this year . . . and a big component of that will be A to H listings,” said Kenneth Chow, managing director at Citi in Hong Kong. He added that Chinese secondary listings could account for as much as “two-thirds” of the total estimated $20bn of listings in Hong Kong in 2025.\n\nAmong the companies this year that have confirmed plans to set up secondary listings are pharmaceuticals producer Jiangsu Hengrui, which has a market capitalisation of $37bn, and soy sauce maker Foshan Haitian, valued at $32bn.\n\nCATL has yet to file papers to the Hong Kong stock exchange, but Morgan Stanley estimates it could raise up to $7.7bn — a move that has been complicated by its addition to a Pentagon list of companies with links to China’s military.\n\nEven so, there are signs of a market eager for new listings. Chinese banks have offered to work on the CATL listing for underwriting fees of just 0.01 per cent, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts at Deloitte’s capital market services group estimate that Hong Kong will have 80 initial and secondary listings this year, raising up to HK$150bn (US$19bn), mostly by Chinese companies. They would join household names that record much of their profit outside of the mainland, including BYD and Tencent.\n\nAn influx would also offer a shot in the arm to Hong Kong’s reputation as an international business hub. More than $10bn in equity was raised, in primary and secondary listings, in the city last year, according to Dealogic. That marked an improvement on 2023’s total of $6bn but fell far short of the record $51bn raised in IPOs in 2020 according to HKEX data. That bumper year was also driven by Chinese companies seeking listings outside the mainland.\n\nThe mainland Chinese securities regulator has further eased the path for companies to list in Hong Kong to help them expand internationally, including a recent pledge to “optimise the filing system for overseas listing”. Other Chinese companies have also given up their listings in New York in recent years, citing the high administrative burden and low turnover.\n\n“We expect the volume of listings, including those of A+H share offerings, to gain further momentum in 2025, as more leading companies from China and around the world use [the Hong Kong] platform to expand internationally,” said a spokesperson for the Hong Kong stock exchange.\n\nAnalysts said US President Donald Trump’s policy towards China could send more companies to the territory.\n\nMany Chinese companies were forced to delist from the US in the final days of Trump’s first administration, when the president issued an executive order, citing fears of links to the Chinese military.\n\n“Geopolitical uncertainties [could prompt] more Chinese companies and US-listed China concept stocks to turn to Hong Kong as their preferred overseas listing hub,” Edward Au, southern region managing partner at Deloitte China, said in a report.\n\nIndustry executives said companies going to Hong Kong would hope to replicate the performance of Midea. The aircon maker raised about $5bn in an oversubscribed offering, and its shares are up 27 per cent since its September float.\n\nThat rate of growth is faster than its Chinese equivalent and narrowed the discount to its mainland shares. A company listed in mainland China typically trades at a premium to its Hong Kong counterpart of as much as 40 per cent, due to the mainland market’s higher level of local retail participation.\n\nRegulators are closely watching the likely valuation of H shares and their discount to A shares. A capital markets banker in Hong Kong told the FT that he had had discussions with Chinese authorities about the potential valuation of H shares.\n\nAuthorities have focused on liquidity potentially leaving the country, which would devalue Chinese companies and encourage arbitrageurs looking to make a profit from the difference in prices between the two stocks.\n\nLarge-cap Chinese companies such as BYD tend to have a much smaller discount in Hong Kong, while smaller companies are relatively unloved outside the mainland.\n\n“The bigger challenge for our . . . projects is if we can narrow the discount between A and H shares even further,” said one executive at a Chinese brokerage. “We also think that there is a high probability that there will be a further rebound [in activity] in 2025.”\n\nThe executive said he expected about $20bn in fundraising this year but added that “this is purely our own estimate”.\n\nAdditional reporting by Cheng Leng and data visualisation by Haohsiang Ko in Hong Kong",

    "date": "2025-01-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter’s guide to Hong Kong\n\nAsk Michelle Garnaut, the pioneering Australian chef and restaurateur, how much the Hong Kong dining scene has evolved, particularly from the point of view of female chefs, since she opened M at the Fringe — the first independent fine-dining restaurant outside a hotel in the city — in 1989. You can expect by way of response a very wry, very worldly, very expressive snort. “Back then, cooking wasn’t even seen as a proper job,” she says. “Virtually no women were involved. I had one talented young female chef — a local — who quit to become a manager at KFC because her parents thought that any managerial role was more respectable than being a chef.”\n\nIt took more than 20 years for such attitudes to change, Garnaut reckons. In that time a generational shift occurred, given impetus by the rise of social media. Successful chefs — mostly men but a growing number of women as well — became ever more visible. Then, in 2013, Vicky Lau was awarded her first Michelin star at Tate Dining Room. A second star followed in 2021. It would be difficult to overstate the importance of Lau’s example to aspiring female chefs not only in Hong Kong but across Asia. Cast your eye over the Hong Kong restaurant scene today and many of its most exciting and talented chefs are women. Meet three of the best.\n\n“Sexy. Fun. Deeply Chinese but also international. With a sense of humour.” May Chow is describing, between bites of a braised pork belly bao, the vibe of Little Bao, her instant-classic bao-based restaurant, which opened in 2013 and has been going gangbusters, in a couple of iterations and locations, ever since.\n\nThere are two ways to make it as a chef in Hong Kong, Chow says: “You can either be best in class or first to market.” She was a bit of both, combining skill and novelty by elevating and elaborating the humble bao — a steamed bun served with a meat or fish filling — in a manner never seen before. She nudged the bao into burger territory, the burger into bao territory, showcasing the joys of each in the process — a remarkable achievement of Sino-American diplomacy. The bao itself remained familiar — pillowy and yielding yet structured and bouncy, the bao of every Hongkonger’s childhood. The fillings . . . well, sometimes, as with the braised pork belly, they were familiar too; sometimes not so much, as with the chestnut tiramisu ice cream.\n\nThe Canadian-born Chow is outspoken in her support of diversity and LBGTQ+ rights. “The great thing about being a chef who is also an entrepreneur is that you can create your own culture,” she says. “Women thrive in the right culture. And there’s more than one way to be successful. Sure, you can be competitive, strong, decisive. But you don’t have to be awful.” This philosophy — the tao of Little Bao, as it were — resonates far beyond the restaurant scene. “The important thing is to recognise that we all have a choice,” she continues. “We can choose better. I hope through my own example I can help pass that message on.” Little Bao, 1–3 Shin Hing Street, Central; Little Bao Diner, 9 Kingston Street, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. Website; Directions\n\nTo anglophone ears, the name Ho Lee Fook sounds like a colloquial exclamation of astonishment. Roughly translated, it means “good fortune for your mouth”. Where the restaurant of that name is concerned, both the literal and figurative associations are spot on. Everything about this beloved Elgin Street institution, which celebrates its 10th birthday this year (a ripe old age for a restaurant in Hong Kong), is contrived to amuse and delight, from the joyous decor (the famous wall of waving golden lucky cats) and the singalong soundtrack (nostalgic chart hits) to the sublimely executed menu (“serious Cantonese food in a playful setting”, as executive chef ArChan Chan puts it).\n\nThough she wears her seriousness lightly, make no mistake — here is a chef of exceptional ability and ambition, committed to honouring dishes she grew up on yet bold enough to tinker with them in ways that even diehard purists are compelled, however reluctantly, to admit just . . . works. Consider her take on stir-fry king, one of those all-time Hong Kong classics with which liberties are not, as a rule, taken. Chan blithely replaces the traditional squid with abalone and jettisons the conventional cashews in favour of peanut sprouts. The one introduces a new layer of luscious, richly textured opulence, the other an element of momentary, eyebrow-raising surprise that’s swiftly followed by a “Why didn’t anyone think of that before?” sense of inevitability. The result is nothing less than a peaceful revolution between two chopsticks. Ho lee fook indeed.\n\nChan’s arrival at Ho Lee Fook in 2021 was a homecoming after more than a decade in Australia and Singapore. The cosmopolitanism of her experience is reflected in the make-up of her brigade at Ho Lee Fook. English is the lingua franca. The design of the restaurant is such that they and their flaming woks are the first things you see when you arrive — the waving cats come next — and the collective good vibes are as thick in the air as the wok smoke. This impression of camaraderie surely starts at the top. Chan speaks of her four principles of respect, care, fairness and honesty: “It’s an intense job. A little bit of empathy makes everything a lot easier.” A touch of genius doesn’t hurt either. Ho Lee Fook, 3-5 Elgin Street, Central. Website; Directions\n\n“We like to categorise things. That’s human nature. But many of us are too quick to categorise Sichuan cuisine. There’s more to it than spiciness,” says Theign Phan, executive chef at the Grand Majestic Sichuan, a gleaming, jewel-toned, Gucci-wallpapered temple to one of China’s most beloved regional cuisines.\n\nThough proud to be among the growing number of female chefs working at the highest level in Hong Kong, she is as wary of gender-based generalisations about the profession as she is of lazy stereotypes of Sichuan cuisine. “When I grew up, I was taught to believe that you can do whatever you want, as long as you do it well,” she says. “It’s up to us to change the narrative.”\n\nAs a Malaysian raised in Singapore, Phan sees herself, as the head of a Sichuan kitchen in a Hong Kong restaurant, not so much as an outsider but as a translator. There’s something of the explorer about her too — an explorer thrilled by the things she’s discovered and eager to divulge her findings with others. “Because there’s so much to share,” she says. “Did you know there are no fewer than 24 distinct flavours in Sichuan cuisine?” The sauce for bang bang chicken, for example, that infinitely moreish Sichuan staple of poached chicken and julienned cucumber, belongs, marvellously, to the “strange flavour” category, which encompasses spicy, numbing, savoury, sweet, garlicky, sour and sesame flavours.\n\nPhan admits that there’s a skill to ordering well in a Sichuan restaurant but insists that it’s not difficult to pick up. It’s all about managing contrasts of flavour and texture. You might, therefore, start with a cold appetiser such as smacked cucumber (garlicky, viscous, crunchy, watery), followed first by kung pao prawns with cashew nuts (an unlikely yet undeniably harmonious marriage of lychee flavour with hints of Sichuan peppercorn and chillies), and then by mapo tofu with beef (the slippery and jelly-like texture of the tofu offset by zingy-yet-earthy chilli-bean paste). Steamed rice is, of course, a constant throughout — the essential thread in the tapestry. And for pudding, perhaps the silver-ear fungus with chrysanthemum resin and rock-sugar soup (sweet, floral, faintly herbaceous and in every respect as intriguing as its name might lead you to expect).\n\nComplex? Certainly. Difficult? Not at all. Phan and the entire Grand Majestic team are on hand to advise. She sees it as their shared responsibility to make acquiring a taste for Sichuan cuisine easy and enjoyable — as well as potentially enlightening. “No pressure, all pleasure.” Grand Majestic Sichuan, Alexandra House, Shop 301, Third Floor, 18 Chater Road, Central.

    "body": "The CIA has concluded that Covid-19 probably began as a leak from a laboratory in China in a new assessment of the origins of the pandemic that killed millions of people.\n\nThe US intelligence agency said it concluded with “low confidence” that the Covid-19 virus had leaked from the research facility, in a shift of its previous position that there was insufficient information to reach a conclusion.\n\n“CIA assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting,” the agency said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n“CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible.”\n\nThe US intelligence community — which is made up of 18 agencies — has been assessing the origin of Covid-19 for the past four years to determine if the virus emerged naturally from a wet market in Wuhan or whether it leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the Chinese city.\n\nThe CIA joins the FBI and energy department in concluding that the virus originated from the Wuhan lab. But it said it had “low confidence in this judgment” and would “continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information” that could change its assessment.\n\nThe new assessment was made public just days after John Ratcliffe was sworn in as CIA director.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart news after he was confirmed as President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the intelligence agency, Ratcliffe said he believed that intelligence and common sense “dictates that the origins of Covid was a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology” and would ensure that “the public is aware that the agency [CIA] is going to get off the sidelines”.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz said that those who had been “labelled conspiracy theorists” for saying Covid-19 was the result of a lab leak had been “right all along”.\n\n“We can’t stop the next pandemic if we don’t understand how the last one happened!” Waltz wrote on X.\n\nOne US official said Bill Burns, CIA head during the Biden administration, had told the CIA team assessing the evidence to take a position on the origin of Covid-19, but did not dictate the outcome.\n\nBurns’ directive came as Jake Sullivan, who served as national security adviser, ordered the intelligence community to take another look at the origins of the pandemic as the Biden team prepared to leave office.\n\nThe US official stressed that the CIA had revised its assessment before Ratcliffe was sworn in as the new director.\n\n“I’ve said from the beginning that Covid likely originated in the Wuhan labs. Communist China covered it up and the liberal media covered for them,” said Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee.\n\n“I’m pleased the CIA concluded in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory is the most plausible explanation of Covid’s origins, and I commend Director Ratcliffe for fulfilling his promise to release this conclusion. Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world.”\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington said it strongly opposed the “politicisation and stigmatisation of the source of the virus”.\n\n“The so-called report of the United States, without any substantial evidence, concocts misleading conclusions, throws dirty water on China and engages in framing. It is still an old routine of political manipulation of tracing the source and has no credibility,” the embassy said.\n\nThe new CIA assessment change comes just over one week after Trump held his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping since at least 2021. While many foreign policy experts had expected Trump to take a tough line on China — particularly over trade — in his first week in office, the president has so far held off taking any harsh measures against Beijing.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News this week, Trump said that while tariffs gave him “tremendous power” over China, he would “rather not have to use it”.\n\nHe also signed an executive order postponing the deadline for the Chinese owner of TikTok to divest the popular video app to avoid a ban in the US.",

    "blurb": "Hedge fund billionaire Liang Wenfeng builds model on tight budget despite US attempt to halt China’s high-tech ambitions",
    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "A small Chinese artificial intelligence lab stunned the world this week by revealing the technical recipe for its cutting-edge model, turning its reclusive leader into a national hero who has defied US attempts to stop China’s high-tech ambitions.\n\nDeepSeek, founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, released its R1 model on Monday, explaining in a detailed paper how to build a large language model on a bootstrapped budget that can automatically learn and improve itself without human supervision.\n\nUS companies including OpenAI and Google DeepMind pioneered developments in reasoning models, a relatively new field of AI research that is attempting to make models match human cognitive capabilities. In December, the San Francisco-based OpenAI released the full version of its o1 model but kept its methods secret.\n\nDeepSeek’s R1 release sparked a frenzied debate in Silicon Valley about whether better resourced US AI companies, including Meta and Anthropic, can defend their technical edge.\n\nMeanwhile, Liang has become a focal point of national pride at home. This week, he was the only AI leader selected to attend a publicised meeting of entrepreneurs with the country’s second-most powerful leader, Li Qiang. The entrepreneurs were told to “concentrate efforts to break through key core technologies.”\n\nIn 2021, Liang started buying thousands of Nvidia graphic processing units for his AI side project while running his quant trading fund High-Flyer. Industry insiders viewed it as the eccentric actions of a billionaire looking for a new hobby.\n\n“When we first met him, he was this very nerdy guy with a terrible hairstyle talking about building a 10,000-chip cluster to train his own models. We didn’t take him seriously,” said one of Liang’s business partners.\n\n“He couldn’t articulate his vision other than saying: I want to build this, and it will be a game change. We thought this was only possible from giants like ByteDance and Alibaba,” the person added.\n\nLiang’s status as an outsider in the AI field was an unexpected source of strength. At High-Flyer, he built a fortune by using AI and algorithms to identify patterns that could affect stock prices. His team became adept at using Nvidia chips to make money trading stocks. In 2023, he launched DeepSeek, announcing his intention to develop human-level AI.\n\n“Liang built an exceptional infrastructure team that really understands how the chips worked,” said one founder at a rival LLM company. “He took his best people with him from the hedge fund to DeepSeek.”\n\nAfter Washington banned Nvidia from exporting its most powerful chips to China, local AI companies have been forced to find innovative ways to maximise the computing power of a limited number of onshore chips — a problem Liang’s team already knew how to solve.\n\n“DeepSeek’s engineers know how to unlock the potential of these GPUs, even if they are not state of the art,” said one AI researcher close to the company.\n\nIndustry insiders say DeepSeek’s singular focus on research makes it a dangerous competitor because it is willing to share its breakthroughs rather than protect them for commercial gains. DeepSeek has not raised money from outside funds or made significant moves to monetise its models.\n\n“DeepSeek is run like the early days of DeepMind,” said one AI investor in Beijing. “It is purely focused on research and engineering.”\n\nLiang, who is personally involved in DeepSeek’s research, uses proceeds from his hedge fund trading to pay top salaries for the best AI talent. Along with TikTok-owner ByteDance, DeepSeek is known for giving the highest remuneration available to AI engineers in China, with staff based in offices in Hangzhou and Beijing.\n\n“DeepSeek’s offices feel like a university campus for serious researchers,” said the business partner. “The team believes in Liang’s vision: to show the world that the Chinese can be creative and build something from zero.”\n\nDeepSeek and High-Flyer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLiang has styled DeepSeek as a uniquely “local” company, staffed with PhDs from top Chinese schools, Peking, Tsinghua and Beihang universities rather than experts from US institutions.\n\nIn an interview with the domestic press last year, he said his core team “did not have people who returned from overseas. They are all local . . . We have to develop the top talent ourselves”. DeepSeek’s identity as a purely Chinese LLM company has won it plaudits at home.\n\nDeepSeek claimed it used just 2,048 Nvidia H800s and $5.6mn to train a model with 671bn parameters, a fraction of what OpenAI and Google spent to train comparably sized models.\n\nRitwik Gupta, AI policy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, said DeepSeek’s recent model releases demonstrate that “there is no moat when it comes to AI capabilities”.\n\n“The first person to train models has to expend lots of resources to get there,” he said. “But the second mover can get there cheaper and more quickly.”\n\nGupta added that China had a much larger talent pool of systems engineers than the US who understand how to get the best use of computing resources to train and run models more cheaply.\n\nIndustry insiders say that even though DeepSeek has shown impressive results with limited resources, it remains an open question whether it can continue to be competitive as the industry evolves. Returns at High-Flyer, its big backer, lagged behind in 2024, which one person close to Liang blamed on the founder’s attention being mostly focused on DeepSeek.\n\nIts US rivals are not standing still. They are building mega “clusters” of Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips, creating the computing power that threatens to once again create a performance gap with Chinese rivals.\n\nThis week, OpenAI said it was creating a joint venture with Japan’s SoftBank, dubbed Stargate, with plans to spend at least $100bn on AI infrastructure in the US. Elon Musk’s xAI is massively expanding its Colossus supercomputer to contain more than 1mn GPUs to help train its Grok AI models.\n\n“DeepSeek has one of the largest advanced computing clusters in China,” said Liang’s business partner. “They have enough capacity for now, but not much longer.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Wenjie Ding in Beijing\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nTechno-utopian thinking, not DeepSeek, is the threat / From Ewan Dunbar, Assistant Professor, Computational Linguistics, University of Toronto, ON, Canada",

    "blurb": "Authorities try to pre-empt holiday cash crunch but shy from cut to reserve requirement ratio",
    "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s central bank has pumped a record amount of short-term funds into the financial system this week in an effort to pre-empt the cash crunch that usually accompanies the lunar new year holiday.\n\nAimed at smoothing seasonal turbulence, the total cash injection of Rmb2.2tn ($300bn) through the 14-day reserve repo — a short-term liquidity tool — comes as millions of residents prepare to travel home, settle tax bills and hand out cash-filled red envelopes.\n\nWhile these injections are commonly seen during the holiday period, the size of this week’s operation has damped expectations of an imminent cut to banks’ reserve requirement ratio, the level of funds that banks must hold in reserve.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China has in recent months repeatedly said it would cut the ratio “at an appropriate time” as part of efforts to revive confidence in the economy. It has also changed its monetary policy stance from “prudent” to “moderately loose” as it tries to spur growth.\n\nA cut in the reserve requirement ratio is widely seen as a substantial easing move aimed at boosting long-term credit.\n\n“The prospect for an RRR cut before the lunar new year now appears slim, given the current liquidity situation and the broader macroeconomic conditions,” said Wang Qing, chief macroeconomic analyst at Golden Credit Rating.\n\n“The central bank had also front-loaded a significant amount of the medium-term liquidity into the market in December, leaving the system adequately supplied but not excessive.”\n\nDelaying a cut reflects the PBoC’s intricate balancing act, with the central bank keen to reserve use of its tools for what it anticipates to be a challenging year economically, said analysts. China’s property market has been hit by a prolonged crisis, and companies are bracing themselves for the fallout of Donald Trump’s protectionist policies.\n\nGiven the strong signal sent by an RRR cut and the limited space for the PBoC to trim it further, the central bank would want to “reserve some bullets for the signalling effect for later”, said Xiaojia Zhi, chief China economist at Crédit Agricole. The average reserve requirement ratio at Chinese banks stands at 6.6 per cent.\n\nThe PBoC is expected to rely more on open market operations in 2025 to manage liquidity, instead of cuts to the benchmark policy rate or the RRR, said Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at ING. “Significant headline moves on interest rates and the RRR are likely being reserved for a more suitable time.”\n\nWith deflationary pressures mounting and the property sector still in deep distress, Beijing is trying to reflate the world’s second-largest economy. Yet it also wants to avoid further renminbi weakness.\n\nThe offshore renminbi has been under strain, weakening 3 per cent against the dollar since Trump’s presidential election victory in early November, while the tightly controlled onshore currency hovered around a 16-month low at the start of the year before rebounding recently.\n\nThe potential escalation of trade tensions between China and the US has heightened fears of capital outflows, limiting the PBoC’s ability to lower rates.\n\n“Recent pressure on the yuan rate will put constraints on the PBoC’s monetary easing measures,” according to an internal briefing memo this week from a state-owned bank seen by the Financial Times. “The central bank has also used subtle actions to temper market expectations of further easing at this stage.”\n\nSince December, the central bank has set a strong daily reference rate for the renminbi, issued offshore bills and stopped buying government bonds. This suggests the PBoC is prioritising currency stability over other pro-growth targets, said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie.\n\n“Last year, the PBoC adopted a strategy we called ‘hang in there until the Fed blinks,’” said Hu. “Now, with the yuan under pressure due to the strong dollar, the PBoC has to hang in there again until the dollar weakens. For now, yuan stability is the priority over other policy goals.”\n\nStill, some analysts said they believed more substantial moves were on the horizon after the lunar new year holiday and that the PBoC had a choice of tools it could use.\n\n“There are a few that the PBoC could consider, including outright reverse repos of various tenors, net government bond purchases, as well as RRR cut,” said Zhi of Crédit Agricole.",

    "body": "The writer is professor of law at the Gould School of Law, University of Southern California, and author of ‘High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy’\n\nLast month, a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek astonished the international tech community with its latest open-source artificial intelligence model. DeepSeek-V3 delivers a performance comparable to that of better-funded US rivals such as OpenAI. This week it impressed once again with R1, its foray into AI reasoning.\n\nDeepSeek is not a one-off. Since the middle of last year, Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance, Moonshot and 01.ai have been steadily narrowing the gap with US peers, matching their capabilities and surpassing them in cost efficiency.\n\nChina’s achievements in efficiency are no accident. They are a direct response to the escalating export restrictions imposed by the US and its allies. By limiting China’s access to advanced AI chips, the US has inadvertently spurred its innovation.\n\nTo reduce reliance on high-end chips from overseas, Chinese AI companies have experimented with novel approaches in algorithms, architecture and training strategies. Many have embraced a “mixture-of-experts” approach, focusing on smaller AI models trained on specific data. These can deliver powerful results while reducing computing resources.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 embodies the success of this resourceful approach. According to its technical report, the model was trained using a data centre powered by Nvidia H800 GPUs — a less advanced chip than Nvidia’s latest releases. Despite this, DeepSeek completed training in just two months at a cost of $5.5mn — a fraction of the sums reportedly spent by US companies such as OpenAI.\n\nDeepSeek has also drastically reduced inference costs, earning it the nickname the “Pinduoduo of AI”, a reference to the cost-slashing business model of the popular Chinese discount ecommerce giant. This breakthrough has profound implications. It challenges the widely held assumption that cutting-edge AI requires vast amounts of computational power and many billions of dollars. DeepSeek demonstrates how software ingenuity can offset hardware constraints.\n\nIt also lays bare the limits of US export controls designed to slow China’s AI progress. While these measures may deliver short-term disruptions, their impact diminishes over time as China innovates to adapt.\n\nThe inconvenient truth for US policymakers is that strict export controls have forced Chinese tech companies to become more self-reliant, spurring breakthroughs that might not have occurred otherwise.\n\nNot everyone agrees, however. Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank, contends that China would have advanced regardless of US restrictions.\n\nCertainly, the Chinese government has long aspired to make the country into an AI superpower. But its record in resource allocation is poor. State-led initiatives often result in inefficiency, corruption and waste — a reality starkly illustrated by high-profile scandals and slow progress in the country’s semiconductor industry.\n\nWhat American AI restrictions inadvertently achieved was a powerful commercial incentive for China’s private sector to step into the gap. And while the US often dominates in groundbreaking research, Chinese companies excel in execution, affordability and product diffusion. In ecommerce, electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries, they have demonstrated an impressive ability to scale up.\n\nThe rise of DeepSeek is a vivid reminder that constraints can fuel innovation. For Donald Trump’s new administration, this raises an uncomfortable question: will ever-tighter sanctions on China accelerate the very progress they are designed to suppress?",

    "blurb": "Friedrich Merz says Berlin will not help businesses if they are forced to write off investments ",
    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The frontrunner to become Germany’s chancellor has warned companies about the “great risk” of investing in China, saying the state under his leadership would not help them if such bets failed.\n\nFriedrich Merz, whose Christian Democratic party is leading in the polls ahead of elections next month, described China on Thursday as part of an “axis of autocracies” that did not abide by “western rule of law standards”.\n\n“I say to all representatives of the German economy that the decision to invest in China is a decision involving great risk,” Merz said after a policy speech in which he advocated for Berlin to take a more active role on the global stage.\n\n“My heartfelt request to all companies . . . Limit the risk you take in order to avoid endangering your own company if it triggers an immediate write-off,” he added.\n\nCompanies such as Volkswagen and BASF, as well as smaller Mittelstand groups, rely heavily on China as an export market and a manufacturing base.\n\nGerman direct investment into China rose sharply last year despite warnings from Social Democratic Chancellor Olaf Scholz about growing concerns over the Chinese market.\n\nAs a result, German companies are exposed to potential geopolitical tensions between Beijing and the west, which have become a more pressing concern after Donald Trump re-entered the White House this week. On Tuesday, the US president said he intends to impose a 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports from February 1.\n\n“You must expect major disruptions if you take this risk. I’ve talked to a whole range of small- and medium-sized and also very large companies,” Merz said.\n\n“If you take this risk and if you have to write off these investments from one year to the next, then please do not, under any circumstances, come to the state . . . for help,” he added.\n\nMerz said that if he were elected chancellor, Germany would re-engage with EU partners including France and Poland and establish a “pragmatic” and “un-romanticised” relationship with the US.\n\n“I have been advocating that we do our own homework here in Europe in view of Donald Trump’s return to office, rather than sitting like a rabbit in front of a snake,” Merz said.\n\n“If we want to be taken seriously as equals, we as Europeans must put ourselves in a position to take responsibility for our own security,” he added.\n\nHe said that such a strategy would involve adopting an EU-wide approach to boost military capabilities through weapons standardisation and economies of scale.\n\nAsked about Trump’s demand that Nato increase its defence spending requirement to 5 per cent of GDP from 2 per cent, Merz said Germany would aim under his leadership to spend “more than 2 per cent”.\n\nHowever, he added that EU members also needed to become more efficient and “get more for our money”.\n\nScholz’s coalition collapsed in November, largely due to concerns over funding for Germany’s huge defence investment needs alongside its support for Ukraine.\n\nGermany is financially constrained by a constitutional debt brake that limits the federal state’s borrowing.\n\nThe dispute triggered early general elections, which are due to be held on February 23. Polls suggest that Merz’s CDU party will win with about 30 per cent of the vote, ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling at about 20 per cent.\n\nMerz has vowed to end the “bickering” he said had come to represent Scholz’s coalition government by creating a National Security Council in the Chancellery to oversee foreign policy and security.\n\n“Ukraine must win the war” against Russia, Merz said, but “Germany must not become a party to the war”. He added that Berlin therefore needed to continue to support Kyiv financially and militarily.\n\n“We are facing nothing more and nothing less than a revanchist, anti-liberal axis of states that is openly seeking to compete with liberal democracies,” Merz said.",

    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s energy sector is getting cleaner and dirtier at the same time. The country added record capacity in wind, solar, and energy storage last year. Yet fossil fuel power generation also hit a new high. Economic growth and energy transitions don’t always sit well together.\n\nDespite aggressive investments in renewables, China’s power sector recorded a 1.5 per cent increase in thermal power output, primarily from coal, in its energy mix last year, according to official data. The increase in fossil fuel output reflects pressures from rising electricity demand, which has outpaced GDP growth for the fifth straight year.\n\nOne driver of this is artificial intelligence. AI is highly energy intensive and gets more so as models become more complex and widely deployed. Broader adoption of automation across industries, from logistics to manufacturing, is also increasing energy demand. The expansion of 5G networks, data centres and cloud computing to support this shift soaks up electricity. These energy-intensive sectors have become increasingly important for China as it builds up its position vis-à-vis its main strategic rival, the US.\n\nRapidly rising demand for electricity has boosted the shares of the country’s coal companies for years, pushing the market value of the largest, China Shenhua Energy Company, to more than $100bn.\n\nThis year could mark a turning point. Analysts expect renewables to meet all new electricity demand in 2025, putting a lid on coal-fired power demand growth. While positive for the environment, it puts the fortunes of the country’s coal giants at risk.\n\nPreviously, sustained investments in wind, solar and hydropower were undermined by a lack of adequate grid infrastructure. That showed in rising curtailment rates, a measure of potential renewable energy going unused due to grid constraints. Those hit 4 per cent for both solar and wind early last year.\n\nBut more than $800bn has been set aside for grid upgrades through 2030 — and it is about to start paying off. Grids that are upgraded to enhance transmission capacity and reduce energy loss should be able to unlock more renewable capacity. Last year, solar power capacity increased by about 50 per cent while wind power rose about a fifth.\n\nAs these upgrades come online, it is a good time for investors to shift their focus towards local renewable energy stocks. Shares of China Shenhua are down a tenth this year and trade just below 10 times forward earnings, a significant discount to its solar and wind peers. The value shift may already be under way.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com",

Developed economies such as the US, EU, Japan and South Korea had also become more attractive.\n\nBy industry, technology and research and development groups were among the most likely to move, with 41 per cent relocating or considering doing so.\n\nBoth the Biden and first Trump presidencies sought to restrict China’s access to advanced technology such as semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries, while Beijing has retaliated by choking off exports of critical minerals, in a deepening tech war between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nThe number of US companies that did not rank China as a high priority for investment has also grown, reaching 21 per cent last year, more than double the level in 2020.\n\nChinese officials have sought to improve the business climate this year for international companies as foreign direct investment has fallen to record lows.\n\nForeign business and investor sentiment in China has soured over the past few years after authorities conducted raids on consultancies and auditors and instituted vague regulations covering cross-border data flows.\n\nBut a third of the US companies surveyed said despite rising geopolitical tensions, the “quality” of China’s investment environment had improved, an increase of five percentage points from the previous year.\n\n“China continues to be a really important market,” said Hart, adding that it was a message AmCham was trying to communicate to the “folks back in Washington”.\n\nMarket access, a long-running complaint among foreign companies in China, remained an important problem, along with increasing competition from local rivals.",

    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chinese authorities have sought to boost the stock market and restore confidence in the world’s second-largest economy by telling local insurance companies and mutual funds to invest more in domestic stocks.\n\nRegulators have told state insurers to invest a minimum of 30 per cent of their new policy premiums in local shares, while mutual funds have been told to increase these shareholdings by 10 per cent annually for the next three years. This is the first time regulators have set an explicit target for investments.\n\nThe policy shift could mean that up to Rmb500bn ($68bn) could flow into the market from China’s three biggest state-owned insurers alone, according to a Financial Times analysis of last year’s policy premiums. Insurers already hold shares worth Rmb4.4tn, said regulators.\n\nThe mainland’s CSI 300 index rose as much as 1.8 per cent on Thursday, almost erasing losses incurred on Wednesday after the new US administration threatened tariffs on Chinese exports.\n\nGeopolitical tensions, a cooling economy and a property market crisis have in recent years hit demand for Chinese equities.\n\nThe latest move, first announced on Wednesday evening by regulators including the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the People’s Bank of China, aims to “stabilise the stock market and clear the bottlenecks for the entry of medium- and long-term funds into the market”.\n\nThe announcement comes days ahead of China’s Lunar New Year holiday, a closely-watched period for retail spending and consumer sentiment.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America estimate that the additional inflows into the equity market could be Rmb470-530bn in 2025.\n\n“Clearly regulators do care about the stock market. They want to adopt a supportive stance and keep injecting confidence into the market right before the Lunar New Year,” said Winnie Wu, chief China equity strategist at Bank of America.\n\n“Judging from today’s share price reaction, it appears that the incremental impact of pure financial and stock market related stimulus [is] no longer as powerful as it was during the last move in September 2024”, she added.\n\nChi Lo, senior Asia-Pacific market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said the announcement was a “stabilising” move because of a “lack of confidence in the private sector” and “weak demand for stocks”.\n\nThe CSI 300 index soared in late September after the government announced support measures, including funding for stock buybacks and mortgage cuts. But it has since fallen 15 per cent from a peak in early October.\n\nIn September, authorities also announced a pool of $100bn to lend to companies to enact share buybacks and to lend to asset managers, insurers and brokers to buy local equities.\n\nThe index closed up 1 per cent on Thursday while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng benchmark was down 0.4 per cent.\n\nChinese insurance companies listed in Hong Kong, such as China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance, rose 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe latest announcement included further fee cuts to some mutual fund products and a crackdown on speculative trading of Chinese shares.\n\nIt also included measures to give state-owned insurance companies incentives to focus more on long-term returns, the latest attempt from Beijing to improve the efficiency of state-run enterprises, amid concerns over capital allocation.\n\nInvestors are watching for more signs of stimulus from Beijing this year after the September package, especially measures to support domestic consumption.\n\nAuthorities this month expanded a scheme to trade in old consumer goods, such as household appliances, for new ones.\n\n“The government has to do something to turn around confidence, and nobody knows exactly what this something is,” said Lo. “Beijing is doing different things, asking state-owned companies to buy the stock market, buy up property, and hopefully some of these things will help to turn around confidence.”",

    "event_name": "How to stop Donald Trump exporting trade wars ",
    "blurb": "Distortions from US tariffs need not be disastrous",
    "date": "2025-01-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Given the all-out declaration of global trade war we feared, it wasn’t actually the worst possible outcome: the first two days of Donald Trump’s presidency saw only the US’s three biggest trading partners threatened with tariffs by the end of next week. Unless you are Mexico, Canada or China, you have the luxury of waiting until April 1 to really start worrying, because that’s when the various reports Trump commissioned on trade and investment are due.\n\nWhat do we read into this timing and sequencing? Nothing, obviously. Nobody knows anything. The palace politics explanation is that the business-friendly advisers around Trump have deterred him from going for tariffs across the board straight away, but then taxes of between 10-25 per cent on a third of the US’s imports aren’t exactly what the American economy needs.\n\nBroad-based tariffs remain a clear and present danger and taxes on goods — from China in particular — could have global knock-on effects. Given weak Chinese domestic demand, a trade war might exacerbate the supposed China Shock 2.0, in which cheap exports of high-tech Chinese goods undercut manufacturers everywhere. Chinese exports diverted from the US by tariffs, the argument goes, will slosh around the global economy swamping advanced and emerging market economies alike. And if others start reacting with their own protectionist measures, could trade wars end up being Trump’s most successful export?\n\nThe experience of Trump’s first term suggests these concerns are serious but not necessarily cataclysmic. In some cases, the US market is less important than it looks. In others, trade will find a way to adapt. It’s the risk of global recession, not the dislocation of supply chains, that is the real threat.\n\nEuropean policymakers are clearly terrified of Chinese imports and particularly electric vehicles (EVs). But the experience of the first Trump term should be somewhat reassuring when it comes to the diversion of Chinese goods from the US market. Simon Evenett and Fernando Martín of the Global Trade Alert project calculate that US tariffs on imports from China resulted in just a net $2.8bn diversion in goods to the EU between 2018 and 2019 — which is small relative to the $46bn overall increase in Chinese goods exports to the EU between 2017 and 2019.\n\nEvenett and Martín found that rather than diverting sales elsewhere, exporters hit by tariffs were often forced into “trade retrenchment”, smaller economies of scale making them less efficient and hence uncompetitive in other markets. To be clear: retrenchment is not a good thing. It reduces efficiency and consumer choice. But it does also lessen the chance of major political conflict over trade.\n\nIn the specific case of EVs, the prospect of big increases in Chinese imports is genuine, with the EU already having imposed anti-subsidy duties to manage the flow. But the US isn’t a major consideration here. There were hardly any imports of Chinese EVs to the US market even before former president Joe Biden imposed 100 per cent tariffs on them. Take-up has always been weak in the US, and by promising to remove Biden’s tax credit for EVs, Trump will essentially remove US-based production and consumption from the global market. (Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, is fine with this: removing the credit consolidates Tesla’s position in the US.)\n\nCertainly, there are substantive concerns about Chinese goods swamping other middle-income countries and governments have erected a series of anti-dumping walls against basic goods such as steel. But there’s great reluctance, among Asian governments in particular, to practice large-scale protectionism. Countries like Malaysia have become highly skilled at positioning themselves in global supply chains and managing relationships with both the US and China.\n\n“Like other emerging markets we have put some antidumping duties on imports from China, but generally only industrial inputs such as steel and polymers,” Tengku Zafrul Aziz, Malaysia’s trade minister, told me. “Even if there’s a major US-China trade dispute, we don’t anticipate going to widescale protection.”\n\nFor both advanced and middle-income countries, the prospect of Chinese goods being kept out of the US is an opportunity as well as a threat. The consultancy Oxford Economics calculates that the impact of a purely US-China trade conflict on other regions’ exports will roughly net out — lower exports to China because of falling demand being compensated by higher sales in the US market to replace Chinese goods. Europe — which competes with China on selling machinery to the US — and Asian economies in particular will benefit.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, bilateral US-China trade dropped off sharply but overall global commerce survived until the Covid-19 shock. Chinese goods often found their way to the US via what the IMF calls “connector” countries like Vietnam by adding an extra stage in the value chain. Trump wants to clamp down on such circumvention, but global supply chains can often innovate faster than policymakers can move.\n\nThe biggest risk to the global economy and trading system from a trade war isn’t export diversion. Supply chains are flexible enough to survive a lot of jockeying for position. It’s a sharp weakening in overall demand, perhaps from Trump crushing consumer spending by trying to eliminate the overall US trade deficit with tariffs, or from falling Chinese export sales adding to the woes of the country’s struggling domestic economy. That would take a truly dramatic escalation in trade tensions to achieve. We’re about to find out just how reckless Trump is and whether he wants to risk it.\n\nalan.beattie@ft.com",

    "body": "Polestar, the electric-car maker backed by China’s Geely, said it will seek new suppliers to get around a US government ban on Chinese software in new high tech vehicles.\n\nThe ban threatens Polestar’s future in the US, but its chief executive Michael Lohscheller said the group would continue to expand in America despite the return of Donald Trump as president, who has vowed to revoke the country’s electric vehicle “mandates”.\n\nLast week, the US commerce department finalised rules prohibiting the use of Chinese software and hardware for electric vehicles, shutting out cars made in China from the American market.\n\nPolestar was considering new non-Chinese suppliers for its EV software and other components Lohscheller said in an interview, adding the group had enough time to find a solution before the ban came into effect from its 2027 model year vehicles.\n\n“We have a manufacturing facility in the US. We are creating American jobs,” Lohscheller said, referring to a Volvo plant in South Carolina that produces Polestar EVs.\n\n“We will and have to find solutions because the US is a big growth market for us.”\n\nPolestar was spun out of Swedish carmaker Volvo, which itself was bought by Geely in 2010, and listed in 2022.\n\nHowever, Polestar’s shares on Nasdaq have since languished, losing more than 90 per cent of their value as the company burnt through cash to scale up its premium EV business.\n\nLast week, Polestar revealed it would take two more years for its free cash flow to turn positive and lowered its market expansion plans.\n\nFollowing a major offloading last year, Volvo retains an 18 per cent stake in Polestar. Geely and its owner Eric Li own a combined 63 per cent stake.\n\nIn the US, Polestar faces Trump’s executive order to end generous EV subsidies and the president’s threat of a global tariff war. This comes on top of rising competition from Chinese rivals and Tesla in other markets.\n\nSome analysts have questioned whether Polestar can expand in the US under its current ownership structure.\n\nBarclays analyst Dan Levy said in a note that Polestar may “either need to exit the US or be spun out into an independent company with no control from Geely nor usage of Geely technologies”.\n\nHowever, Lohscheller said pulling out of the US was not an option. “I think we should hold the course” on Polestar’s electric vehicle strategy, he added. “And then we will see what customers really want.”\n\nThe former Opel chief stressed Polestar’s software-defined vehicles and other technologies will set the brand apart at a time when many other start-ups have struggled with slowing growth in sales of battery-powered cars.\n\nHe added order intake for the company’s electric vehicles was up about 37 per cent in the fourth quarter due to demand for its Polestar 3 and 4 models.\n\n“Who else has this [strength in software-defined vehicles] in the market today? And the answer is Tesla, Rivian and the Chinese. That’s a big, big advantage,” he added.\n\nLohscheller cautioned against “overreacting” to Trump’s executive orders upon taking office, including one aimed at halting distribution of unspent funding from former president Joe Biden’s landmark climate legislation.\n\nHe added: “One statement on the first day doesn’t have to solve everything. If [Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act] were really stopped, let’s see because . . . there was a lot of good investment going into the US. Let’s see how that plays out.”",

    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Two Iranian cargo vessels carrying a crucial chemical ingredient for missile propellant will sail from China to Iran over the next few weeks, according to intelligence from security officials in two western countries.\n\nThe Iranian-flagged ships — the Golbon and the Jairan — are expected to carry more than 1,000 tonnes of sodium perchlorate, which is used to make ammonium perchlorate, the main ingredient for solid propellant for missiles.\n\nTwo of the officials said the sodium perchlorate could produce 960 tonnes of ammonium perchlorate, which makes up 70 per cent of the propellant for solid-fuel missiles. That amount of ammonium perchlorate could produce 1,300 tonnes of propellant, enough to fuel 260 mid-range Iranian missiles such as the Kheibar Shekan or Haj Qassem, the officials added.\n\nAmmonium perchlorate is among chemicals controlled by the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international anti-proliferation body.\n\nThe chemicals were being shipped to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite arm of the Iranian military, two of the officials said.\n\nThe two officials said 34 20-ft containers containing the chemical had been loaded on to the Golbon, which departed the Chinese island of Daishan on Tuesday. The Jairan is expected to depart China with 22 containers in early February. Both ships, which are owned by Iranian entities, were expected to make the three-week voyage to Iran without making any port calls, the officials said.\n\nThe officials said the chemicals were loaded on to the Golbon at Taicang, a port just north of Shanghai, and were destined for Bandar Abbas, a port in southern Iran on the Persian Gulf.\n\nBased on data from vessel tracker Marine Traffic, the Golbon spent at least several days off Daishan island before leaving on Tuesday. Marine Traffic showed the Jairan about 75km south of Daishan off the coast of Ningbo in China’s Zhejiang province early on Wednesday.\n\nThe officials could not say if Beijing was aware of the shipments. The US and its allies have frequently criticised China for providing support to regimes from Tehran to Moscow.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington said it was “not familiar” with the situation and that Beijing was committed to “maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East and Gulf region and actively promoting the political and diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue”.\n\nThe Iranian government declined to comment.\n\nDennis Wilder, a former top CIA China analyst, said China had carried out extensive arms sales to Iran dating back to 1979, including supplying “Silkworm” anti-ship missiles in 1986 during the Iran-Iraq war.\n\n“Since the early 1990s, China has assisted the Iranian military extensively with its ballistic missile development programme and has provided expertise, technology, parts, and training,” said Wilder, who is now at Georgetown University.\n\n“China’s motivation for secretly assisting Iran today includes clandestinely helping Iran produce missiles for the Russian war effort [in Ukraine], cementing common cause against perceived US hegemonism . . . and Beijing’s purchase annually of large amounts of discounted Iranian crude oil.”\n\nWashington has also criticised China for violating US sanctions by purchasing Iranian petroleum, but critics of Joe Biden’s administration say it did not do enough to enforce the sanctions.\n\nThe US has also increased pressure on Beijing over the past two years for not doing more to stop the shipment of dual-use items to Russia that have helped Moscow in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But the volume of shipments has shown little sign of falling.",

The price of gold also rose to an 11-week high of $2,758 per troy ounce.\n\n“The central question about tariffs is does Trump want [higher] tariffs or does he want them as a tool to negotiate?” said Andrew Tilton, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Goldman Sachs, which forecasts that “more tariffs are likely”.\n\nChina had largely avoided direct attention from Trump during his whirlwind first day in office, in which he suggested levying 25 per cent tariffs on the US’s largest trading partners Canada and Mexico, leading traders to slash bets on a resumption of the trade war started in his first term.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that the 10 per cent tariff was being considered to punish China for the flow of the opiate fentanyl to Mexico and Canada. The US has accused China of sending the chemicals used to make fentanyl to Mexico, where cartels manufacture the drug.\n\nIt was a repetition of an earlier threat the new president had made last year, on top of a campaign vow to impose a blanket 60 per cent levy on Chinese imports.\n\nTraders widely expect the US dollar to continue to strengthen against the currencies of major trading partners, including China, as higher tariffs and lower interest rates in China weigh on the renminbi.\n\nMore than a quarter of fund managers polled in a Bank of America survey said “long US dollar” was the most crowded trade in January.\n\n“Market moves have in no way fully undone [the pricing of] tariff risk; if the US were to come out and say ‘no tariffs’ you would likely see a meaningful weakening in the US dollar,” said Tilton.\n\nStocks in the rest of Asia were broadly up on Wednesday. Korea’s Kospi rose 1.3 per cent and Japan’s broad Topix climbed 0.9 per cent. Taiwan’s benchmark index advanced 1 per cent while India’s Sensex edged up 0.2 per cent.",

    "blurb": "New US president hints at potential agreement linking TikTok ownership with levies",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chinese officials were prepared for Donald Trump to deliver bad news on his return to the US presidency: immediate 60 per cent tariffs on exports that could deal a serious blow to the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nWhat they got instead seemed mild. Trump first ordered an investigation into US-China trade, before on Tuesday reiterating the threat of a 10 per cent tariff related to the deadly opioid fentanyl.\n\nThat was enough to hit China’s stocks and currency. The mainland’s CSI 300 index fell 1 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng retreated 1.6 per cent on Wednesday, while the offshore renminbi weakened 0.25 per cent.\n\nStill, Trump’s opening moves on China were less severe than the 25 per cent tariffs he announced on US allies Mexico and Canada. He also hinted at a potential broader deal linking tariffs to ownership of TikTok, the Chinese-controlled short-video platform that US security hawks want to shut down.\n\nDespite Trump’s tendency for erratic statements and rapid changes of course, this softer than expected prelude has rekindled hope in Beijing that negotiations might be possible to avert a second trade war. Now, the question is what kind of deal would be acceptable to both sides.\n\n“There is a possibility that the two sides can strike a deal — you can sense there is cautious optimism,” said Zhao Minghao, professor at the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. “But we will need to see if there is a good match between what Trump and Beijing can offer each other.”\n\nTrump and China’s President Xi Jinping held a phone call the weekend before the inauguration, their first in four years, which the US president described as “very good” and covered “Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects”.\n\nXi also dispatched the most senior Chinese official ever to attend a US inauguration, vice-president Han Zheng, who also met US business leaders including Trump confidant Elon Musk.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump had vowed to hit China with 60 per cent tariffs upon taking office, and later threatened an additional 10 per cent on day one to compel Beijing to crack down on flows of precursor drugs for fentanyl.\n\nInstead, on Monday he issued a memo directing officials to investigate the US trade deficit and “recommend appropriate measures, such as a global supplemental tariff or other policies, to remedy such deficits”.\n\nHe also asked the US Trade Representative to study Beijing’s compliance with the “phase one” deal agreed during his first term as president, and to consider additional tariffs “particularly with respect to industrial supply chains and circumvention through third countries” — a move with potentially much further-reaching implications for China.\n\nEconomists believe part of China’s trade with the US has been diverted through third countries to avoid tariffs since the trade war of Trump’s first administration. The US officials are due to report their findings on April 1.\n\nAlthough Trump signed an order allowing TikTok to operate for 75 days — a turnaround from his first term, where he had sought to ban it from the US — he also said Beijing would need to allow a US entity to take half of the company or face tariffs of up to 100 per cent.\n\nThe linking of tariffs to TikTok’s ownership followed quixotic remarks on Monday by Musk, who complained that while the former was allowed to operate in the US, his social media site X was blocked in China.\n\nOne person familiar with the matter in China said Beijing might agree to TikTok’s owner ByteDance selling the platform as part of a broader deal that would cover a range of issues including trade. However, any such discussions were at an early stage, the person said.\n\nChinese officials, who have long opposed a forced sale of TikTok and would need to approve it, have in recent days appeared to signal a more hands-off approach.\n\n“When it comes to actions such as the operation and acquisition of businesses, we believe it should be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles,” the foreign ministry said on Tuesday, adding that “China’s laws and regulations should be observed”.\n\nGabriel Wildau, managing director at consultancy Teneo, wrote in an analyst note that Chinese leaders might “believe that an amicable resolution of the TikTok issue could lay groundwork for co-operation” on other issues.\n\n“These could include tariffs, export controls, and — in a dream scenario for Beijing — even US policy towards Taiwan and the South China Sea,” Wildau said.\n\nHowever, economists warned that it was too early to be confident that trade conflict could be averted. While Trump sounded more open to dealmaking, his administration was filled with China hawks, they said.\n\n“This is more of a holding pattern for now,” said Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC. “It is somewhat encouraging that we didn’t see an immediate rise and tariffs and that maybe there is some room for discussions beforehand. But I think it would be the wrong conclusion to say that China is now entirely off the hook.”\n\nAside from trade, Beijing could offer Trump help on other issues, such as resolving the Ukraine war, said Wang Chong, a foreign policy expert at Zhejiang International Studies University.\n\nWang warned, however, that Beijing was ready if relations broke down. Even if the US started with small tariff increases, it would undermine investor confidence in China. “If tariffs are imposed, China should fight,” Wang said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Arjun Neil Alim in Hong Kong",

    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Good morning. Upon arriving at the White House, Donald Trump signed orders to review “unfair trade practices”, but did not slap any new tariffs yet on his trade partners. Here are five takeaways from his opening salvo, and what it could mean for the EU.\n\nToday, our trade correspondent outlines how the new EU justice commissioner wants to protect consumers from buying dangerous goods. And our Rome reporter has a dispatch on the recent train chaos in Italy that may or may not have been caused by sabotage.\n\nBrussels should get the powers to stem the flood of dangerous goods sent to Europe in small parcels from China, EU justice commissioner Michael McGrath tells Andy Bounds.\n\nContext: Some 10mn items are flown into the EU every day, most of them coming from China. The European Commission has previously launched investigations into Chinese retailers such as Temu over the alleged sale of illegal goods.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with the Financial Times, McGrath said the number of items that are faulty or do not meet safety standards was “an issue of major concern”.\n\n“The overwhelming majority originates from China, and the surveys and the analysis that has been done shows a very high level of non-compliance with EU safety standards,” he said.\n\n“It also affects European companies because it undermines the level playing field . . . and impacts on the ability of European companies to compete,” McGrath said.\n\nThe commission is preparing a paper on ecommerce for next month that will recommend tighter customs controls, among other measures. But McGrath believes member states are struggling to keep up with the rising demand, despite increased collaboration between them.\n\n“It is an area where I believe there is a need for a centralised EU action,” said the Irish politician.\n\nWhile new rules that allow national authorities to block certain websites are helping, McGrath wants to examine “centralised investigative and enforcement powers at an EU level”.\n\nMcGrath, who is also responsible for upholding democracy and EU values, also insisted that EU regulations of large online platforms were not “about censorship”.\n\n“It is about ensuring that where there is illegal content, such as illegal hate speech, that that is removed,” he added.\n\nMcGrath defended the relatively slow pace of investigations into platforms including X and TikTok over how they handle content and potentially influence users.\n\n“The EU can only act on the basis of evidence,” he said, and companies must have “a fair opportunity to respond, to address the concerns that have been raised”.\n\nThe commission also wanted to be confident that a fine or other punishment could survive a challenge at the European Court of Justice. “We’re very anxious to avoid the damage that could be done by adverse findings before the ECJ,” he said.\n\nMcGrath added that more legislation might be needed to protect free and fair elections, with a crucial poll in Germany next month.\n\nThe change of guard in Brussels is helping fuel a debate on whether the EU needs to reassess its merger rules to better support industrial policy.\n\nItaly’s transport minister Matteo Salvini has warned about sabotage to the country’s railways as recent disruptions have paralysed the country, writes Giuliana Ricozzi.\n\nContext: Earlier this month, a faulty power line at Milan’s central station resulted in dozens of train cancellations and hours of delays. Since then, similar malfunctions have occurred around the peninsula, igniting a debate on the railways’ conditions, and the responsibility for the disruptions.\n\nLast week, Ferrovie dello Stato, the state company in charge of rail infrastructure, formally requested prosecutors in Rome to investigate what it described as “abnormal incidents’’ and “highly suspicious events’’, adding that the faults could be part of a deliberate sabotage campaign.\n\nSalvini, who is in charge of transport as well as deputy prime minister, has come under fire for the disruption, with opponents calling for his resignation.\n\nSpeaking in parliament yesterday, Salvini echoed the warnings of sabotage, saying the “situation was objectively worrying’’.\n\n“Italy is not and will never be intimidated,” Salvini said, adding that “for years the railway network has unfortunately been under attack”.\n\nBut opposition parties and unions have shown scepticism at the sabotage theory, rather pointing at frequent technical issues on the network and their mismanagement.\n\nThe countless disruptions and delays come as Italy’s old fashioned railway system is undergoing a big modernisation process with 1,200 open construction sites across the country.",

    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chinese banks have been pitching to work on the blockbuster Hong Kong secondary listing of the world’s leading EV battery maker CATL for as little as 0.01 per cent in fees, highlighting cut-throat competition in a once-lucrative listings market where business has significantly slowed.\n\nCICC and CSC are among the banks lined up for a leading role on the deal, which stands to be one of the biggest listings in Hong Kong in recent years. JPMorgan and Bank of America are also lined up for top roles.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the matter said CICC’s pitch for a role on the deal had suggested they would be willing to work on it for fees of 0.01 per cent of the capital raised, which could ultimately top $7bn. Two people with knowledge of the matter said CSC had also pitched for a fee at around that level.\n\n“I think in this market, competitors are willing to do things for almost nothing,” said a senior banker at an institution that pitched for a role.\n\nCompanies typically use the numbers from several banks’ pitches as a guideline when deciding how to set fees, rather than directly paying them the amount they pitched. The total fee pool can be shared unevenly between the banks.\n\nCATL was planning to pay 0.2 per cent in underwriting fees, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Incentive fees on top of this — based partly on the value of the orders that each bank brings in — could make the final number higher, two people briefed on the deal said. Fees on large deals such as CATL’s listing can often be lower than on smaller ones, but figures below 1 per cent are unusual.\n\nMorgan Stanley has estimated the CATL listing could raise up to $7.7bn, marking one of the biggest offerings in the territory in recent years and giving the Shenzhen-listed company access to offshore funds as it seeks to expand overseas. CATL announced its plans in December, with the listing expected later this year.\n\nBankers said Chinese banks were willing to accept rock-bottom fees on such a major offering as there was little business and the IPO market was yet to recover on the mainland. A director at a European bank who pitched said it was not a surprise to see the cut-throat pitches “given most of their China team onshore has lots of capacity but no deal flows”.\n\nUS banks are planning to work on the deal despite the Pentagon this month adding CATL — a supplier to Tesla, Volkswagen and Ford — to a blacklist of companies that it says are linked to China’s military.\n\nInterest among some US institutional investors for an allocation has also not wavered, according to bankers involved. The defence department’s list only prevents those named doing business with the US military and has no direct legal ramifications, but it brings reputational risk.\n\nCATL said in a statement it had “never engaged in any military-related business or activities”, the move was a “mistake” and was “expected to have no substantially adverse impact on our business”.\n\nThe battery pioneer shelved a previous plan to sell up to $5bn in Swiss global depositary receipts in 2023 following regulatory concerns over large-scale offerings.\n\nOn average, banks would pitch for or receive at least a single-digit fee on a Hong Kong listing, according to investment bankers and prospectuses filed to the exchange in 2024.\n\nAn executive at another bank that pitched for a role described the CATL listing as a “franchise-defining deal” and said bankers would want to be involved despite the low fees.\n\nBanks also have an incentive to be in on the deal in the hope of future business with CATL, such as block trades that could be more lucrative.\n\n“Everyone just wants credits on the league table, they’re not trying to make money on this deal,” said one senior Chinese banker familiar with the pitch. “It’s very annoying to see some peers sabotaging the norms, but there’s nothing we can do about it.”\n\nBank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and CICC declined to comment. CSC and CATL did not respond to requests for comment.",

The group also plans to invest about $6.8bn overseas to build up its foundation model training capabilities using advanced Nvidia chips.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of ByteDance’s domestic semiconductor orders would go to Chinese suppliers such as Huawei and Cambricon, while the rest would be spent on Nvidia chips that have been watered down to align with US export controls, the people said.\n\nBeijing has given Chinese tech companies informal guidance to buy at least 30 per cent of their chips from the country’s own suppliers, the people added.\n\nThe $6.8bn in overseas investment was budgeted to build out ByteDance’s AI computing capacity for model training. This investment could face challenges from recently expanded US export controls designed to hamper Chinese companies building sensitive technologies.\n\nThe push comes as ByteDance faces pressure in its core social media business. TikTok restored service to 170mn US users on Sunday after new President Donald Trump said companies that distributed and hosted the platform would not be held liable for violating a US law that banned the video app unless it was sold.\n\nWhile Trump signed an executive order on Monday to keep TikTok open for 75 days, he said he wanted a US company to have 50 per cent ownership in the video app in the future. The president said he could “certainly” put tariffs on China if it rejected a deal.\n\nAny such transaction could affect plans for a future ByteDance initial public offering, with the company valuing itself at $300bn during a recent share buyback programme.\n\nThe company drew up its huge purchasing budget for graphic processing units in 2025 before the recent interventions in the US.\n\nByteDance, which under the direction of the tech group’s founder Zhang Yiming has become the frontrunner in China’s AI race, is doubling down to build out its own AI infrastructure to train its foundation model, as well as to implement AI functions across its various platforms.\n\nIt has built up computing capacity in south-east Asia, particularly in Malaysia. Though Chinese companies have been banned from purchasing Nvidia chips outside of the US since 2023, they have been able to secure access to chips through rental agreements with third-party data centre providers, several industry insiders said.\n\nThis loophole was closed last week by Joe Biden’s administration, which issued new rules that the identity of both the owner and operator of the chips must undergo a review process.\n\nWhile Trump could take a different stance on export controls, the regulations — if strictly implemented — would make ByteDance’s chip purchases overseas more difficult than ever.\n\nIt has made large orders to build up overseas AI capacity this year, such as through rental agreements, one of the people said. It should be sufficient for most of the company’s needs in 2025 but what happened after that remained uncertain, the person added.\n\nByteDance’s budget for purchases of AI chips overseas was previously reported by news outlet The Information. In response to the FT’s reporting, ByteDance said: “The anonymously sourced information about our plan is incorrect.”\n\nByteDance also faces challenges from deep-pocketed local competitors, such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, which are investing heavily in generative AI. Alongside these rivals, it has been pushing out more capable models and lowering costs for developers.\n\nChinese companies still need to build up the capacity of AI data centres onshore to support the use of AI applications even after the models have been trained.\n\nByteDance plans to use most of its Chinese AI chips — including Huawei’s Ascend and Cambricon — for “inference” tasks, the computation undertaken by large language models to generate a response to a prompt.\n\nByteDance released its AI chatbot Doubao in August 2023 and the AI app has become China’s most popular AI application, according to website analytics site Aicpb.com.\n\nDoubao, which means “beanbag” in Chinese, had 71mn regular monthly active users as of December, compared with OpenAI’s 300mn weekly active users globally.\n\nNvidia recorded $11.6bn in revenue from China, including Hong Kong, or about 13 per cent of its global total, during the first three quarters of 2024, according to company filings.\n\nByteDance is by far the largest client for Nvidia in China. The TikTok parent can only buy less advanced chips such as Nvidia’s H20 for Chinese data centres, a specialised and less-powerful version of its GPUs tailored to align with US export controls.\n\nIn 2024, it ordered about 230,000 of Nvidia’s chips, mostly H20s, according to estimates from tech consultancy Omdia. This compares with 485,000 of the more advanced “Hopper” chips bought by Microsoft last year and the 224,000 acquired by Meta.\n\nTech companies around the world have spent an estimated $229bn on servers in 2024, according to Omdia, led by Microsoft’s $31bn in capital expenditure and Amazon’s $26bn.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ryan McMorrow in Beijing and Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington",

    "blurb": "President vows to correct ‘unfair practices’ as US trading partners prepare for an era of tariffs ",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Donald Trump imposed no new trade tariffs on the first day of his second term, as feared by markets, but the US president did lay out the official blueprint for an “America First Trade Policy”.\n\nA presidential memo called on federal agencies to remediate “unfair trade practices” and identify “currency manipulators”. Trade pacts with China, Canada, Mexico and all other partners were placed under review.\n\nThe message: the Trump administration was ready to use all means to re-engineer trade flows to its advantage. Here are five takeaways from the opening salvos of Trump’s trade agenda.\n\nTrump mentioned tariffs just three times in his inaugural address, calming investors and trade partners who had been warned to expect “day one” levies. But he did outline plans to set up an External Revenue Service to collect tariffs, indicating serious plans to increase revenues from trade.\n\nJosh Lipsky, a senior director at the Atlantic Council think-tank, said tariff decisions are likely to be delayed, but not abandoned. “The president was worried about the market reaction on Tuesday and he didn’t want it to mar his first day.”\n\nThe president’s “America First” memo provided a framework for the new agenda, announcing reviews into unfair trade practices, the reasons for US trade deficits and whether competitors are manipulating currencies and unfairly taxing US business.\n\nTrump also sharpened his rhetoric and repeated threats to apply 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, despite the countries’ free trade pact. When asked about the prospect of imposing universal tariffs on anybody doing business with the US, the president said: “We may. But we’re not ready for that yet.”\n\nOn Tuesday Trump also reiterated a campaign threat to impose a 10 per cent tariff on China as a means of punishing Beijing for the flow of Fentanyl to Mexico and Canada. He said this could happen on February 1.\n\n“The experience of the first term is to expect tariffs sooner rather than later,” Lipsky warned, adding the administration did not have a full economic team in place and wanted to establish solid legal bases for any moves.\n\nTrump appears to be prioritising actions on the US’s nearest trading partners, saying he was preparing tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be applied as soon as February 1.\n\nTrump had no qualms in hitting US allies in his first term, invoking national security concerns to put tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. But by going so publicly for Canada, analysts say he is signalling that no country is safe from the self-declared “tariff man”.\n\nThe president’s trade memo ordered a review of trade ties with Canada and Mexico by April 1 (a later date from Trump’s tariff warning, which he did not explain). Preparations would then begin for a comprehensive review of the USMCA trade deal in July 2026.\n\nOne priority highlighted in the trade memo is Trump’s determination to cut “unlawful migration and fentanyl flows”, particularly from Mexico and Canada.\n\nMany supply chains for US manufacturers, particularly carmakers, rely on operations in all three countries and those businesses could put pressure on Trump to rescind his threats.\n\nOn Tuesday Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was taking Trump’s proposals “seriously” and would respond if tariffs were imposed, while Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said it would focus on the “decrees rather than the discourse”.\n\nOther parts of the president’s policy cover the means to enable a comprehensive shift in Washington’s dealings with its trade partners.\n\n“I am not expecting tweaks on the margins,” said Kelly Ann Shaw, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells and a former Trump trade adviser. “But rather a review of the entire panoply of trade and economic tools that results in significant action.”\n\nThe broad range of initiatives kick-started by the memo include a probe into currency manipulation. Trump has previously accused China of undervaluing the renminbi to boost the value of its exports.\n\nThe president also directed his trade representative, Jamieson Greer, to review US trade deals, including the limited one struck during the first Trump administration that was intended to boost exports to China.\n\nSeveral sections of the memo direct various US economic officials to probe Washington’s economic relations with Beijing more broadly, including a review of existing tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nGreer has also been asked to identify possible new deals with significant market access for “American workers, farmers, ranchers, service providers and other businesses”, indicating the second Trump administration may be open to forging new trade agreements.\n\n“This is a pretty huge deal. It makes me think at some point there is going to be a trade bill in Congress,” said Everett Eissenstat, a partner at Washington law firm Squire Patton Boggs. “Once trade bills start moving they tend to be very significant and the statutes don’t change that often.”\n\nTrump has linked tariffs to other policy goals, beyond reducing trade deficits.\n\nHe has promised duties on EU products unless the bloc’s members buy more American oil and gas. Trump on Monday also suggested tariffs on China could hinge on a deal over TikTok’s ownership. He said he would apply levies on Chinese imports of up to 100 per cent if Beijing failed to agree on a deal to sell at least 50 per cent of the app to a US company.\n\nAnahita Thoms, head of international trade for law firm Baker McKenzie in Germany, said Trump was using tariff threats to maximise his leverage.\n\n“I do not think he is bluffing but he is using it as a negotiating tool,” she said. Now “each country will know what concession it will have to make to be on good terms”.\n\nThe threats risked collateral damage. “Tariffs would be inflationary,” said Thoms, adding Trump would not “want to do something that has a negative impact on inflation”.\n\nUS imports from countries such as Vietnam and Mexico picked up in Trump’s first term. This reflected the trend of Chinese manufacturers seeking to bypass US tariffs by exporting to America via third countries.\n\nTrump’s trade team have realised this. His memo calls on Greer to consider additional tariff modifications to address “circumvention through third countries”.\n\nThe memo asks officials to look at whether a “global supplemental tariff” could be used to remedy the “large and persistent” annual US trade deficit. That indicates that something similar to the universal tariff promised by Trump on the campaign trail might still emerge.\n\nHis threats could also stimulate other countries to increase trade with each other. Just since December, the EU has clinched agreements with the Mercosur group of South American countries and Mexico while restarting talks with Malaysia after more than a decade.\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the global trading system would survive the “initial shock” of Trump’s trade barriers.",

    "blurb": "US president has claimed Washington is providing ‘insurance’ for Taipei",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Taiwan’s parliament has frozen critical parts of the 2025 defence budget, heightening the risk that the country alienates US President Donald Trump just at the moment that it needs firm US support against security threats from China.\n\nTaipei has been eager to demonstrate to the incoming US administration that it is stepping up efforts to strengthen its defences. Trump claimed in July that Taiwan “doesn’t give us anything” and compared the US to “an insurance company” for the island nation’s security.\n\nBut just hours after Trump was inaugurated to a second term on Monday, Taiwan’s opposition-controlled legislature voted to freeze half the country’s budget for its submarine programme, 30 per cent of the military’s operations expenditure and one-third of the funding for a drone industry park. It also cut 60 per cent of the defence ministry’s publicity budget.\n\nTaiwanese government officials and ruling party lawmakers accused the Kuomintang, the largest opposition party, of helping China by undermining President Lai Ching-te’s minority government.\n\nBlocking parts of the defence budget “shows the world that Taiwan’s determination to defend itself has been significantly compromised”, premier Cho Jung-tai told reporters.\n\nPo Horng-huei, vice-minister of defence, said that the freeze on the operations budget would impede the military’s daily efforts to counter “grey zone” provocations from China, while the drone funding restrictions would set Taiwan further back in an area where it already “lags far behind” the People’s Liberation Army, and that has become a crucial weapons category since the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe slashing of the publicity budget would hinder efforts to fight Chinese cognitive warfare, he added.\n\n“Our defence will move backwards this year,” Po said.\n\nThe draft budget submitted by Lai’s government in August included NT$647bn (US$20bn) in defence spending. While that was a 7.7 per cent increase over the 2024 budget, it amounts to only 2.45 per cent of GDP, down from 2.5 per cent last year and short of the 3 per cent target US officials and defence experts have urged for Taiwan.\n\nElbridge Colby, Trump’s nominee for under-secretary of defence for policy, has repeatedly criticised Taiwan over its “meagre” defence spending, and has suggested US support would be moot unless Taipei strengthened its defences against the threat from China.\n\nBeijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and threatens to annex it by force if Taipei refuses unification indefinitely. Over the past few years, it has stepped up military operations around Taiwan.\n\nCounter to Trump’s claims, Taipei is one of the largest paying customers for US defence companies.\n\nBut Washington maintains a policy of “strategic ambiguity” on whether it would come to Taiwan’s defence. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the US considers any effort to determine Taiwan’s future by non-peaceful means as of grave concern to the US, and commits to providing Taiwan with defensive weapons and to maintaining its own capacity to resist coercion that would jeopardise Taiwan’s security.\n\nFormer president Joe Biden said on multiple occasions that the US would deploy forces to defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, but Trump has said it would be “very, very difficult” to do so.\n\nTaiwan’s military will be able to access the frozen funds only if parliament agrees to unblock them following a report from the defence ministry at a plenary session.\n\nAlthough the KMT advocates for closer ties across the Taiwan Strait, it denies being pro-Beijing and has previously pledged to support increased defence spending.\n\nBut opposition lawmakers attacked government spending plans as “wasteful”, echoing some voters’ criticism about the ruling party.",

    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The US share of global cross-border investment projects has soared to its highest level on record, underscoring the country’s stronger economic momentum than Europe or China as Donald Trump starts his second term in the Oval Office.\n\nThe figures for announced greenfield projects — where companies build or expand new facilities and operations in a foreign country — come as political and business leaders gather in Davos to debate how the Trump presidency might reshape the global economic order through steep tariffs and reshored production.\n\nThe proportion of new FDI projects announced in the US rose from 11.6 per cent in 2023, to 14.3 per cent in the 12 months to November 2024, according to the Financial Times’ analysis of data collected by fDI Markets, an FT-owned company that has tracked cross-border investments from 2003.\n\nThe increase has been driven by buoyant consumer demand and government incentives in the world’s largest economy, according to economists.\n\n“The US is pulling in more and more global investment projects and this reflects the strong demand outlook and much stronger productivity growth than elsewhere,” said Innes McFee, global economist at Oxford Economics.\n\n“We expect that US exceptionalism to continue,” he said, adding that while the Trump policies were creating uncertainty, a looser budget would drive demand and “add to reasons for investing in the US in the short term. Protectionist policies might do the same”.\n\nTrump will address the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday via video link, with delegates in the Swiss resort keen to hear his economic plans. The president did not immediately impose higher import levies in the executive orders he issued during his inauguration on Monday.\n\nThe US attracted more than 2,100 new FDI greenfield projects in the 12 months to November, preliminary 2024 data showed. By contrast, China secured just under 400 projects, close to a record low and a fraction of the 1,000 plus investments received each year in the decade up to the mid-2010s.\n\nNew projects in Germany plunged to 470 in the 12 months to November 2024, the lowest figure in 18 years in Europe’s largest economy and a big decline from 1,100 greenfield investments a year earlier.\n\nNathan Sheets, chief economist at US bank Citi, said the American surge was partly because of the country’s importance as a hub for AI innovation, lower energy costs and investment incentives as part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips Act.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s share of inward FDI has fallen due to “geopolitics”, Sheets said, referring to the west’s attempts to “de-risk” from China.\n\nEurope’s share has fallen even more sharply. Energy prices surged on the continent following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. “Cheap energy is attractive to investors,” said Sheets.\n\nThe estimated value of new greenfield FDI projects in the US announced in the 12 months to November 2024 rose by more than $100bn to $227bn, according to fDi. The data is based on corporate announcements, press reports and fDI estimates for the lifetime of the project, rather than annual capital spending.\n\nThe rise in US greenfield investment is spread across several sectors. Record 12-month totals were recorded for semiconductor projects — which have benefited from the Chips Act’s grants and credits — and in industrial equipment, construction, electronic components, renewable energy and aerospace.\n\nUS growth is forecast to continue outpacing the rates in other advanced nations, according to IMF figures released last week. The US is now expected to grow by 2.7 per cent in 2025, compared with an expansion of just 1 per cent in the Eurozone.\n\nThe shifting geopolitical landscape, with rising trade tensions between the US and China, is contributing to recent FDI trends as multinationals try to hedge supply chain risks.\n\n“Global trade is more fragmented and securing supply chains becomes the name of the game,” said Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier. “This means a trend towards friendshoring for goods you do not intend to produce and reshoring for strategic industries such as microchips and healthcare.”\n\nSixty-two per cent of FDI projects in the US last year were from western Europe, up from an average of 58 per cent in the 10 years to 2019, the last year before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn contrast with the inward FDI surge, the number of overseas projects from the US shrank to 2,600 in the 12 months to November, the lowest in two decades, excluding the height of the pandemic. The Biden administration’s industrial policies have incentivised US companies to keep production in the country, experts said.\n\nWhile uncertainty over Trump’s trade and taxation plans has hung over big corporations since November’s election, economists do not expect his agenda to deter projects in the short term.\n\nTrump’s election “doesn’t change the investment incentives and the economic picture” for investors, said Richard Bolwijn, head of investment research at UN trade body Unctad’s investment and enterprise division. “From that perspective, the attractiveness of the US for world investment will continue to go up.”",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has said that tariffs on China could hinge on a deal over TikTok’s ownership, as he signed an executive order to keep the popular short-form video platform online in the US for 75 days.\n\nWithin hours of his inauguration on Monday, Trump postponed a deadline requiring TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell its stake in the app or face a ban in the country.\n\nTrump said the US “should be entitled to get half of TikTok” if the app continued operating beyond that cut-off and that he could “certainly” put tariffs on China if it rejected a deal, which he said would be a “hostile act”.\n\nHe said the tariffs could be as high as 100 per cent. “Ultimately [Beijing] would approve it because we’d put tariffs on China,” Trump said on signing the order. “I’m not saying I would, but you certainly could do that.”\n\nChina was one of three countries Trump threatened to hit with tariffs on his first day in office. On Monday, he said he could impose levies of 25 per cent on Canada and Mexico from February 1.\n\nBut he did not enact sweeping 60 per cent levies on Chinese imports as he had promised during the campaign, in what would have marked a new stage in the trade war with Beijing during his first term.\n\nThe move to hold off on tariffs against China appeared to offer a bargaining chip for a TikTok deal. Trump spoke to Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday and said he had raised the TikTok issue, although Beijing did not confirm the discussion.\n\nTikTok became temporarily unavailable for about 170mn US users at midnight on Sunday following the initial deadline under the “divest or ban” law, but it resumed service hours later.\n\nThe executive order said companies that distribute and host TikTok — which include Apple and Google as well as cloud provider Oracle — would not be held liable for violating the law during the 75-day extension. Under the law, service providers risked fines of $5,000 per user.\n\nBut Tom Cotton, Republican head of the Senate intelligence committee, warned the companies on Sunday that they risked “ruinous bankruptcy” by violating the law.\n\nTikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew had gone on a charm offensive after Trump had indicated during his campaign that he hoped to “save” the app.\n\nChew attended the inauguration alongside tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg and was seated beside Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence, drawing criticism from some observers.\n\nMany US politicians and security officials believe China’s government could use TikTok to access Americans’ personal information, which could facilitate espionage, and wield the app’s algorithm to spread propaganda. TikTok denies that Beijing has any control over the app.\n\nTikTok has also said that divestment was not technologically feasible within the law’s timeframe. Beijing has indicated that it opposed a sale.\n\nNevertheless, Trump suggested that if the app was to continue operating, the US should be paid “half of the value of TikTok”, adding: “If I don’t do the deal it’s worthless. If I do the deal, it’s worth maybe a trillion dollars.”\n\nLast week, the Financial Times reported that Chinese officials were discussing using Musk, a close confidant of Trump, as a broker in a potential sale of TikTok’s US operations. Musk on Monday met China’s vice-president Han Zheng, who attended Trump’s inauguration.\n\nHe also called out TikTok’s presence in the US — while western platforms such as his social media site X are banned in China — as “unbalanced”, adding “something needs to change”.\n\nBeijing did not immediately respond to Trump’s remarks threatening tariffs if it did not agree to a TikTok deal.\n\nOn Monday, China’s foreign ministry had said that any decision regarding TikTok’s ownership should be taken “according to market principles and be determined by the companies themselves”.\n\nAdditional reporting by Aime Williams in Washington",

    "blurb": "Austria-based, London-listed RHI Magnesita says ingredient needs strategic designation to protect European industry",
    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The EU urgently needs to classify a substance used to line furnaces and kilns for making cement, glass and steel as a critical raw material or supplies will become hostage to China, the world’s biggest producer of high-end industrial ceramics has warned.\n\nStefan Borgas, chief executive of London-listed RHI Magnesita, told the Financial Times that while magnesite was essential to basic chemical processes underlying Europe’s industrial base, its absence from a list of strategically important materials had disincentivised homegrown production.\n\nMagnesite is used to make refractories, materials that allow furnaces to handle extremely high temperatures above 1,200C. Europe imports most of its magnesite from China, which controls two-thirds of global production.\n\n“We have enough magnesite in Europe that we could secure supply to the European heavy industries,” Borgas said, adding that EU critical materials designation was helping to boost investment in the mining and processing of lithium, nickel and other metals where China also dominated supply.\n\n“For sure it gives a boost to the European production of these materials,” Borgas said. “We have natural resources [but] Europe has neglected its mining capabilities over the last 50 years.”\n\nThe call by Vienna-based RHI Magnesita is a sign of how far China’s global surge in industrial exports in response to faltering domestic demand is extending beyond steel and other widely used metals to lesser known but equally critical materials.\n\nThe company, which has a listed subsidiary in India and a market value of about £1.5bn, is battling falling prices for refractories as Chinese producers turn to exports to absorb excess capacity. Factories in India are also investing in new refractory production as the country pursues its steelmaking ambitions.\n\nIn an effort to boost its supplies of the commodities required to make clean technologies such as batteries and wind turbines, the EU has listed 16 products including nickel, lithium and cobalt as “strategic” as part of a Critical Raw Materials Act that sets targets for their domestic extraction, processing and recycling.\n\nBorgas argued that magnesite should be added to this list because it also underpinned the processing and recycling of more than half of these “strategic” minerals.\n\nHe said that including it on the list would also help companies cluster together to invest in decarbonising high-emitting processes. The production of one tonne of magnesia from magnesite emitted about 1.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide, Borgas said.\n\n“Being on the strategic raw material list helps to support investment in totally new technologies. [This is] uncharted territory, which for any single company would be very risky. But as a cluster, this could become very interesting.”\n\nThe global supply of refractories is running at about 40 per cent above demand but the supply chains for raw materials, such as magnesite, were becoming precarious, according to RHI Magnesita.\n\n“For every building material for modern society . . . you need refractories,” Borgas said. “You need this ceramic insulation layer inside the furnace in order to protect the plants and the people from this hot material.\n\n“The Chinese have invested into this based on their resources and — very reliably, actually — supply the world . . . Europe and every other continent should take care that they at least use what they have,” he said.\n\nThe EU should update the critical raw materials list by May 24 2027, according to the act. Any material must be assessed before it can be added, an EU official said.",

    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Huawei is seeking to grab a larger share of the Chinese market for artificial intelligence chips that is dominated by Nvidia, by encouraging local companies to adopt its rival processors for “inference” tasks.\n\nLeading AI companies in China rely on graphic processing units (GPUs) made by Nvidia to “train” large language models, with the $3.4tn US chipmaker’s products seen as vital to developing the technology.\n\nInstead of challenging Nvidia in training, Huawei is positioning its latest Ascend AI processors as the hardware of choice for Chinese groups running “inference”, the computation undertaken by LLMs to generate a response to a prompt. The Chinese tech giant is betting that inference will be a bigger future source of demand if the pace of model training slows and AI applications such as chatbots become more widespread.\n\n“Training is important, but it only occurs a few times,” said Georgios Zacharopoulos, a senior AI researcher working on inference acceleration at Huawei’s Zurich lab. “Huawei is mostly focused on inference, which ultimately will serve more customers.”\n\nIt is focused on the technically less challenging but potentially lucrative path of retrofitting AI models trained on Nvidia products to run on Ascend chips, according to company employees and Ascend customers. Since Nvidia GPUs and Ascend operate on different software, Huawei is helping companies use another software tool to make the two systems compatible.\n\nHuawei’s push comes with top-down government support. Chinese officials have urged local tech giants to buy more of Huawei’s AI chips and shift away from Nvidia.\n\nOne person familiar with Nvidia’s operations in China said Huawei was seen internally as the most serious competitor in the country, adding that its chip design capability was “advanced”.\n\nWashington has sought to curb Beijing’s development of AI with export controls aimed at hampering the development of sensitive technologies in China. Unlike their US rivals such as OpenAI and Google, companies are unable to access the most cutting-edge GPUs in China. But even though Chinese groups are only able to acquire Nvidia’s less-powerful H20 chips, which are tailored to meet export controls, the GPUs remain in high demand as they are considered better than local alternatives.\n\nAnalysts and Huawei researchers said Ascend was not yet ready to replace Nvidia for model training because of technical issues, such as a breakdown in the ways the chips interact with each other inside a wider “cluster” of AI chips when training ever larger models.“While the Ascend chips perform well on a per-chip basis, there is a bottleneck with the inter-chip connectivity,” said Lin Qingyuan, Bernstein’s China semiconductor analyst. “When training a big model, you must break it into smaller tasks. If one chip fails, the software needs to figure out a way for the other chips to take over without delay.”\n\nThe other challenge for Huawei is convincing developers to switch from Nvidia’s Cuda software, renowned as the company’s “secret sauce” for being easy to use for developers and capable of vastly accelerating data processing.\n\nBut Huawei’s soon-to-be-released and updated version of its AI chip, the Ascend 910C, is also expected to address these concerns. “We’re expecting this new generation of hardware to come with improved software that makes it more accessible for developers,” said a Huawei employee, who declined to be named.\n\nHuawei and Nvidia face stiff competition. Chinese internet group Baidu and chip designer Cambricon have made strides in AI chip development. Meanwhile, in the US, Amazon and Microsoft are also betting they can grab more market share in chips for inference as AI applications become more widespread.\n\nEstimates from SemiAnalysis, a chip consultancy, suggest Nvidia made $12bn on sales in China last year by delivering 1mn of its H20 chips in the country, selling twice as many AI chips as Huawei with its Ascend 910B.\n\n“Nvidia’s China-specific H20 GPUs make up the majority of AI chips sold in China. But the lead is narrowing quickly as Huawei increases manufacturing capacity,” said Dylan Patel, chief analyst at SemiAnalysis.\n\nIndustry insiders cautioned that Huawei’s AI chip push was also being constrained by insufficient supply, with two prospective customers telling the Financial Times that they were unable to secure the chips.\n\nHuawei did not respond to a request for comment. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nAnalysts have said that Huawei’s manufacturing is likely to be facing challenges due to US export controls that have left Chinese fabs dependent on outdated chip manufacturing equipment.\n\nThe focus on inference also points to an evolving dynamic in Chinese AI that differs from the US. Washington’s export controls mean Chinese AI players are not engaged in the same race as Silicon Valley rivals Meta, Elon Musk’s x.AI and OpenAI to build large mega-clusters of Nvidia’s most advanced GPUs.\n\n“Chinese companies are playing a different game. They are paying much more attention to inference than the US because it is possible to make big efficiency gains even with less powerful chips, which also means they can achieve commercialisation faster,” said Bernstein analyst Lin.\n\nChinese companies were betting they could stay competitive on AI by driving down the cost of inference, which in turn made it cheaper to run AI applications, he said.\n\nLast month, Hangzhou and Beijing-based start-up DeepSeek released its V3 model, which garnered attention because of its low training and inference costs compared with comparative models in the US.\n\nThe company proposed a new way for an AI model to selectively focus on specific parts of input data as a way of reducing the costs of running the model. It also used the “mixture of experts” technique popular with other Chinese AI start-ups, which also helps to speed up inference because only part of the model is used to generate a response.\n\nDeepSeek said that Huawei had successfully adapted V3 to Ascend, providing detailed instructions for developers on how to use the chip. The FT has previously reported that Huawei had dispatched engineers to help customers migrate from Nvidia to Ascend.\n\nAdditional reporting by Zijing Wu in Hong Kong",

    "body": "Elon Musk has objected to a lack of reciprocity in the US-China tech relationship, a rare criticism from the billionaire on issues sensitive to Beijing after US president-elect Donald Trump prepared to offer a reprieve to TikTok on a ban in the US.\n\nMusk, who has long sought to maintain close ties with Communist party officials in China, a core market and production centre for his electric-car company Tesla, has for years been careful in his statements about Beijing.\n\nBut he said on Sunday that “something needs to change” after Trump said he would “most likely” extend a deadline for Chinese tech group ByteDance to divest from TikTok, which faced a ban under a US law that briefly forced it offline.\n\nMusk said that while he opposed banning the short-form video app on free-speech grounds, “the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China, is unbalanced”.\n\n“Something needs to change,” he said in a post on X.\n\nAsked about Musk’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Monday that Beijing welcomed any company that abided by its laws and Chinese groups abroad were obliged to follow local rules.\n\nResponding to Trump’s proposal to push TikTok, which began restoring service in the US on Sunday, into a joint venture, Mao said Chinese groups should “decide independently” on operations and deals.\n\nMusk’s criticism was mild compared with some of his fierce attacks on western politicians and recent intrusions into the domestic politics of countries such as Germany, the UK and Italy.\n\nBut it highlighted the Tesla chief’s potential conflicts of interest between protecting his business interests in China and serving as a confidant to the incoming president and a government efficiency tsar.\n\nTesla earned almost a quarter of its sales in the third quarter from China and exported even more vehicles from its Shanghai plant to third countries.\n\nSome analysts believe Beijing is pinning its hopes on Musk as a potential intermediary with Trump, who has vowed to increase tariffs on imports from China. Chinese officials had previously discussed using Musk as a broker to resolve TikTok’s fate in the US.\n\nMusk on Sunday also met Chinese vice-president Han Zheng, who will represent President Xi Jinping at Trump’s inauguration. The presence of a Chinese official as senior as Han is unprecedented at US presidential inaugurations, where Beijing is normally represented by its ambassador in Washington.\n\n“Han met . . . Elon Musk, and welcomed US companies including Tesla to seize opportunities and share the fruits of China’s development,” China’s state-run news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nHan also met business leaders from the US-China Business Council and the US Chamber of Commerce on Sunday, as well as Trump’s incoming vice-president JD Vance.\n\nHan and Vance discussed the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, which successive US administrations have pushed Beijing to crack down on, as well as regional stability and balancing trade, the Trump-Vance transition team said in a statement.\n\nUS business leaders in the past have sought to play a moderating influence in often-volatile Sino-US relations, a role Beijing seems eager to encourage ahead of the second Trump administration.\n\nHan described US business as a “backbone” of relations between the countries, and urged businesses to “play an active role as a bridge” in US-China relations, Xinhua said.",

    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "For the past four years, Alan Estevez has been finding new obstacles to place in China’s path as it tries to use US technology to develop cutting-edge chips and artificial intelligence.\n\n“We’re running down the alley throwing garbage cans,” Estevez told the Financial Times on his penultimate day as under-secretary of commerce for industry and security in Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nEstevez and Tarun Chhabra, a White House official, have been responsible for policies designed to slow China’s semiconductor and AI industries by severing access to critical US technology.\n\nIn their final week, the commerce department unveiled several significant rules, including a global licensing regime for AI data centre chips that garnered resistance from industry and criticism from the European Commission.\n\nEstevez conceded that US policy could do no more than slow China since it had smart engineers, money to invest and government support. But he said Washington had been successful, pointing to statements from Chinese AI groups identifying US export controls as their main obstacle.\n\n“We’ve definitely impeded the People’s Republic of China’s ability to produce those chips and ergo have impacted their ability to develop large language models,” said Estevez, referring to the models that power AI products.\n\nThe outgoing under-secretary has straddled two forces: American companies and some allies who believe the US went too far, and critics who wanted the administration to take even harsher, quicker action against China and its military.\n\nHe pushed back against criticism of the recent AI rule, which puts countries into three tiers in terms of ease of access to US chips. Estevez said it appeared to spark more criticism because the companies complaining, such as Nvidia, were household names, unlike the chipmaking equipment producers that opposed other export controls.\n\nOver the past four years, Estevez and Chhabra have held long and often contentious talks with allies, particularly Japan and the Netherlands, to build a seamless export control regime for chipmaking tools.\n\nTokyo and The Hague eventually agreed to many actions pushed by Washington — in some cases after threats of extraterritorial action — but the talks highlighted a problem for the US and allies: Chinese retaliation. Beijing threatened to restrict exports of two critical minerals, gallium and germanium, to Japan if it went along with Washington.\n\n“We do need to think harder about how we are going to wean ourselves off adversarial supply chains,” said Estevez, explaining the need to reduce Beijing’s ability to create choke points that make it harder for the US and allies to take actions against China.\n\n“What I wish we had done sooner . . . is sharing our intelligence [with allies] and where we see threats,” he said. “When we do that, they actually say: ‘Yeah, you’re right’, and that makes it easier to dialogue.”\n\nEstevez noted some companies struggled to understand the national security implications of selling technology to China, particularly because they had focused on that market for decades before Washington became more hawkish on Beijing.\n\n“For American business, it was like ‘gung ho’ until suddenly it’s not. I don’t think everyone has got that in their strategic mindset of where those lines are,” said Estevez, adding that the US government needed to do a better job explaining the risks to companies who did not have security clearances.\n\nWhile the administration has been criticised by industry, others have questioned why the government did not take quicker action against efforts by Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei to move into the chip sector.\n\nEstevez said the US was “really successful” in using controls to target equipment going to fabrication plants linked to Huawei.\n\nBut he said the US could not take immediate action when it discovered in 2023 that Huawei was building chip fabrication plants, partly because unilateral moves would not have been effective and also because it needed more intelligence to explain the threat to allies to seek their co-operation.\n\nAs Estevez leaves office, he stressed that the Bureau of Industry and Security, which he runs, needed more resources to deal with the expanding threat. It also needs more modern technology, including AI, to boost efficiency in order to, for example, stay on top of Chinese companies that change their name to avoid scrutiny from the US.\n\n“I wish I could have made the inter-agency process a little more agile and a little more strategic,” he said, noting that he and Chhabra would normally “cut a deal” but then have to grapple with the whole government.\n\nEstevez said his biggest concern as he prepared to hand over the reins to Donald Trump’s team was China’s technology sector, particularly AI, which he described as the “future of warfare”.\n\n“It’s going to be the good side of that future, too,” he said, “and we’re just going to impede the bad side of that future.”",

    "blurb": "Biden’s parting gift throws down the gauntlet to the incoming president on industrial policy",
    "date": "2025-01-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The first Trump administration reversed America’s stance on global trade. Joe Biden then doubled down on Donald Trump’s tariffs, while adding industrial policy to the mix. Now his parting gift to Trump is a new trade verdict that argues for US government support for the maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors in the face of Chinese competition. It will be the first big test of whether Trump’s second term will be focused on the economic desires of his base, or the “tech-industrial complex” decried by Biden in his parting speech.\n\nThe timing is no accident. The investigation, issued by the US trade representative under Section 301 of the Trade Act, lays out how China has used non-market practices to dominate the global maritime industry. While Biden has supported pushing back against such practices, not everyone in the Democratic party has been eager to make the shift. By releasing the case four days before Trump’s inauguration, the departing administration has made sure it didn’t get derailed by Democrats who would prefer to tip-toe away from the issue of Chinese mercantilism. It also threw down a gauntlet for Trump. Will tariffs be his only tool? Or will he support industrial policy and US workers in more effective and durable ways?\n\nWhether or not you support Section 301 action, it’s tough to read the case and argue that China’s behaviour in shipbuilding isn’t discriminatory. There are the usual problems, like massive state loans and access to non-market excess capacity in raw materials. Then there are the distortions in the Chinese labour market that make it nearly impossible for market economies to compete in the maritime sector, where China now has a market share of more than 50 per cent.\n\nOne of the most interesting sections of the report dives deep into the hukou system. In this, Chinese citizens are classified as rural or urban residents, and can’t receive state benefits such as education, housing, or healthcare outside the jurisdiction in which they were born. Since many rural residents migrate to coastal areas to work, the result is that half of the population resides in urban areas, but only a third have an urban classification.\n\nThat has a hugely distorting effect on Chinese and global labour markets. As one scholar quoted in the report notes, the hukou system creates a “huge class of super-exploitable, yet highly mobile or flexible industrial workers for China’s new economy, now closely integrated into global trade networks”. It is essentially a massive state transfer from labour to the owners of capital, which is one of the reasons why Chinese economists concerned about bolstering domestic consumption would like to get rid of it (hukou reform is happening, though not as fast as many would like).\n\nIt’s also one of many ways in which China’s system is incompatible with the Bretton Woods trading system as it exists today. “There’s no question that China’s very different economic model makes it difficult to have a system of globalisation based on WTO rules,” notes economist and Nobel laureate Michael Spence. Indeed, that’s the reason that Biden’s trade representative, Katherine Tai, pushed (albeit unsuccessfully) for a new model of trade based on setting a floor, rather than a ceiling, on environmental and labour standards.\n\nTrump certainly won’t care much about the former, but politically, he will need to care about the latter. The fractures between the Maga base and billionaire class populating the top ranks of his administration are already showing. If he chooses not to take on the shipbuilding support recommendations left by his predecessor, unions and Maga hardliners alike will pitch a fit, which could sow major discontent in his first 100 days.\n\nBut I’m betting that the Trump administration will take up the issue, and perhaps even offer up more vigorous support than Democrats might have done. Trump loves bright shiny objects, and nothing is brighter and shinier than a new aircraft carrier.\n\nMore importantly, there are legitimate national security and commercial supply chain reasons to build more non-Chinese maritime capacity. Nearly half of US goods and 80 per cent of global trade is transported by ship. China can significantly influence the pricing and availability of ships given its share of the market. It’s hard to imagine that this power wouldn’t be weaponised in the event of any US-China conflict. Trump has already suggested the US build ships with allies like South Korea.\n\nOf course, increasing maritime capacity is a long-term, heavy lift. And yet, the success of the Chips Act, which has rebooted US semiconductor production in less than two and a half years, shows that it is possible to create more resiliency and redundancy in critical industries when there is political will. The question is whether Trump will have any. Slapping tariffs on adversaries and allies alike is much easier than actually crafting a multifaceted industrial policy.\n\nThat said, the political pull towards it will be pressing. Much of the Biden administration’s stimulus went into red states. The Chips Act is supporting construction of new semiconductor plants in Ohio, Texas and Arizona, all of which voted for Trump. The bipartisan Ships Act introduced last month provides a road map for maritime industrial policy. Whether Trump follows it will say much about the direction of his second term.\n\nrana.foroohar@ft.com",

    "body": "Welcome back. Donald Trump will be inaugurated as US president on Monday. What better time to stir the pot with a contrarian take on his team’s plans to squeeze China in trade, manufacturing and technology?\n\nUnderstandably, many reckon that additional tariffs and restrictions on China will be bad for its economy. But Trump’s protectionist efforts could cause less harm than expected. In fact, Chinese industry could prosper in spite (or even because) of them. Here are the counterarguments.\n\nLet’s begin with the immediate, direct economic impact of tariffs. China has diversified away from the US market since Trump’s first term. Total American demand for Chinese goods now accounts for about 2.8 per cent of China’s GDP, according to Capital Economics.\n\nIts calculations suggest that an increase in the effective tariff from around 15 per cent to 60 per cent (in extremis) — as Trump has threatened — could shrink the Chinese economy by a mere 1 per cent. (Other economists end up in the same ballpark.)\n\nThat’s perhaps smaller than many thought, and it is also before considering other offsetting factors.\n\nChina can divert exports to other destinations where there is rising demand. After tariffs hit the country in Trump’s first term, Beijing’s exports to fast-growing emerging markets soared. Demand for Chinese goods in the developed world excluding the US also picked up. Other nations — particularly those in the Belt and Road Initiative whom China has spent decades strengthening economic ties with — will want to maintain low-cost trade with Beijing.\n\nNext, Chinese goods could still find their way to the US via trans-shipment — export through a third country — which would allow producers to avoid the levies. Trump has cottoned on, and is looking to clamp down on countries such as Mexico and Vietnam. That won’t be easy or fast. Chinese companies are already hedging this risk by setting up factories across the world.\n\nThe renminbi is also likely to weaken when tariffs are announced. That will keep Chinese exports competitive. (Depreciation in the renminbi offset the impact of levies in Trump’s first term.)\n\nAll things considered, the direct economic hit could be well below 1 per cent.\n\nCost of living pressures and the urgency of climate change mean the economic rationale to import cheaply from China (at least beyond the US) remains strong.\n\nChina’s price competitiveness comes from its specialism in sourcing, refining and producing goods that align with global growth sectors. A decades-long, state-led industrial strategy has given China vertical dominance of the supply chains for electric vehicles, batteries and renewables, from rare earth commodities to finished products.\n\nThe country commands close to a third of global manufacturing output (exceeding the output share of the next nine largest producers combined). It has a revealed comparative advantage across a broad range of goods: not just the old-school “Made in China” toys and clothing, but high-end, sophisticated products too.\n\nIndeed, efforts to restrain China’s industrial prowess often underestimate just how dominant it is and Beijing’s ability to use state apparatus to support its producers. Goldman Sachs’ China economist Lisheng Wang has suggested “continued policy support for high-tech manufacturing” and “fiscal easing” would help mitigate the impact of tariffs.\n\nBeijing could use rising US protectionism around the world as an opportunity to improve trade ties with America’s frustrated allies. It could also retaliate by blocking access to vital raw materials. China has 36 per cent of the world’s rare earth reserves, but controls 70 per cent of the global supply (hence Trump’s obsession with Greenland).\n\nFinally, though the west has advantages in artificial intelligence, semiconductors and quantum computing, protectionism in these areas may not hinder China’s development of advanced technologies as much as some might expect.\n\nBNP Paribas Asset Management’s Chi Lo argued in a note last year that “restrictions can only bolster China’s resolve to become tech self-sufficient”. Lo’s view brings the proverb “necessity is the mother of invention” — popularised by 20th-century Danish economist Ester Boserup — to mind.\n\nWith national control over its private sector, Beijing is using subsidies, directives and incentives to meet President Xi Jinping’s objective to be world-leading in scientific and technological innovation. State-driven industrial strategy has its flaws, but China is better than any other at doing it well.\n\nThat means US export controls can incentivise Chinese companies — supported by Beijing — to redouble efforts on import substitution and tech independence through innovative workarounds, domestic collaboration and even black markets. Manufacturers face “fierce competition” with one another for state support.\n\n“On net, American restrictions have accelerated China’s innovation drive,” said Dan Wang, a fellow at the Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center. “Before, Huawei and BYD would buy the best components on the market, but now their incentives are aligned to the Chinese government’s. Huawei’s money now goes to local semiconductor firms.”\n\nAccording to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, China led in just three of 64 critical technologies between 2003 and 2007, but had become the lead country in 57 of those technologies between 2019 and 2023.\n\nDespite being cut from western semiconductor supply chains, Huawei and SMIC developed a smartphone with cutting-edge chips in 2023. Last year, Huawei unveiled plans to mass produce an AI chip.\n\nBeijing has developed a domestic engine to power scientific innovation. It has the world’s largest number of STEM graduates, and provides long-term capital for research and development (which, as a share of GDP, is closing in on the US). This has undermined the restrictions put in place in Trump’s first term and under Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nStill, things may not go China’s way. For instance, Trump’s protectionist agenda could drive wider global uncertainty, depressing demand and amplifying the hit from tariffs on Beijing’s economy. The rest of the world may get tougher on Chinese imports too. Plus, the country’s state-led innovation model is no panacea. It relies on the government making the right calls when allocating (and pulling) funds. That can be wasteful.\n\nChina also has significant structural economic issues. Its growth trajectory has weakened, and it is struggling to revive animal spirits and boost consumption levels following the property market crash. That leaves it too reliant on export- and investment-led growth.\n\nBut the point remains. Trump’s tariffs may not be as harmful to China’s manufacturing and technological supremacy as anticipated. Beijing has bigger challenges to worry about.\n\nThoughts? Rebuttals?

    "body": "The writer is chief executive of the New America think-tank and an FT contributing editor\n\nFor almost two decades, China adhered to the doctrine of “peaceful rise”, a concept developed by state counsellor and intellectual Zheng Bijan. It emphasised China’s desire to grow in power and prosperity by integrating into the international system, without posing a threat to other nations.\n\nThe strategy succeeded: from the 1990s to the mid-2010s, China’s GDP and global influence rose spectacularly. Xi Jinping, however, changed course. Beginning in 2017, he launched a set of tactics that became known as “wolf warrior diplomacy”. Chinese diplomats became more assertive in defending China’s interests. And in a few short years the Chinese government succeeded in undoing much of the goodwill that years of peaceful rise had engendered.\n\nIn 2023, Xi backed off. But this aggressive advance of China’s interests had made it worse off in the world, creating lasting distrust and convincing many of China’s partners to hedge their bets by strengthening relations with the US.\n\nNow, US president-elect Donald Trump and his merry band of tech titans are embracing their own brand of Wild West diplomacy, amplified with a dose of Silicon Valley swagger. Its hallmarks are supreme self-confidence, a disregard for rules of any kind and a willingness to make deals with anyone anywhere as long as they advance immediate self-interest.\n\nTrump himself lives in a world of self-bestowed superlatives, which find a ready echo in his new friends from California. Many of the men who have risen to power and unimaginable riches on the back of technological innovation assume that American superiority over other countries is as evident as the superiority of the tech sector over the rest of the US economy. It is the future, and they control it.\n\nSuch attitudes seem certain to create a regular stream of incidents and mini-crises with other countries. Yet based on the Chinese experience, the issue will not be this or that outrage, but the steady accumulation of statements and actions that gradually permeate the domestic politics of other nations, shifting coalitions in consequential ways.\n\nAs Xi discovered, Beijing’s truculence and bald assertion of entitlement strengthened the hand of China hawks in both the US and the EU, and sowed doubt among former China supporters. Long-term damage to the relationship between Washington and Beijing was the result not only of Trump’s actions during his last term in office, but also a deep shift in the views of former Obama officials who entered the Biden administration and built on many of Trump’s anti-China policies.\n\nPushing US technological supremacy, in particular, will embolden those in other countries who are already seeking to challenge the grip of big American tech companies. The EU has been fighting the power and reach of those companies for over a decade. The new Trump administration, following Meta’s refusal to deploy its artificial intelligence in the EU, is likely to force showdowns that will provide a needed spur to the creation of integrated European technology and defence markets.\n\nIn countries such as Mexico, India, Brazil, Turkey, South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia and Indonesia, even where current leaders are friendly to Trump, the constant push from Washington to open markets and improve terms of trade in favour of US companies will alienate local entrepreneurs and exporters.\n\nThe US, like China in the wolf warrior years, will increasingly be known for breaking and circumventing domestic and international rules. Demands that everyone else “pay up” for American military protection could look ever more like a global extortion racket.\n\nRising middle powers, now able to play a much more independent role on the global stage than in the 20th century, are not willing to be pawns in a US-China competition. They will insist instead on asserting their own national interests in the same way that Trump wishes to put America first.\n\nThe George W Bush administration eschewed international rules and processes in favour of “coalitions of the willing”. Since then, Republican unilateralists have been followed by Democratic multilateralists who spent years repairing damage to the US’s global relationships and creating new informal alliances and coalitions.\n\nThis cycle, however, has worn away trust and confidence in the US’s reliability as a partner and ally. Add a heavy dose of arrogance and insult, and the damage caused by the next era of American wolf warrior diplomacy could be permanent.",

The question is, what tool do you use?” Källenius told the Financial Times in an interview. “Don’t accelerate protectionism because . . . we have much to lose.”\n\nIn October, Brussels imposed tariffs of up to 45 per cent on Chinese EV imports after a big surge in sales, alleging they received unfair subsidies, and opened several anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. Beijing responded with anti-dumping tariffs on brandy and investigations into pork and dairy products.\n\nGerman carmakers have been the most vocal opponents of protectionist measures as they fear retaliatory moves from Beijing and weakened interest from the country’s consumers at a time when they have already suffered a sharp decline in sales due to the rise of Chinese brands.\n\nThey have also struggled to compete against more affordable and advanced Chinese EVs from companies such as BYD.\n\nWhen German carmakers sought to establish themselves in the emerging Asian economy in the 1980s they agreed to form joint ventures with Chinese partners. Källenius said it was a decision for EU policymakers whether to come up with a reciprocal arrangement.\n\n“When we came to China . . . there was a call upon us by the policymakers: industrialise here if you want to capture the market. From my understanding, European policymakers have said the same, vis-à-vis the Chinese,” he said.\n\n“I think those are legitimate conversations, but that means that you would actually open up markets and create as much as possible a level playing field and then let the best market actor win.”\n\nBrussels is also planning to impose criteria requiring Chinese businesses to have factories in Europe and share technological knowhow. BYD plans to build vehicles in Hungary, while CATL has recently agreed to build a €4.1bn lithium battery factory in Spain with Stellantis.\n\nKallenius said tariffs would hurt the industry and Brussels should compromise with Beijing on a deal to remove them, adding that China had become an integral part of the global automotive supply chain, including raw materials, advanced chips and components.\n\n“We just want to caution policymakers to say, don’t forget what made us so successful in this complicated world,” he said.\n\nLast week Acea sent a letter to EU leaders urging them not to retaliate against US president-elect Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs.\n\nMercedes-Benz is one of Germany’s top three carmakers alongside VW and BMW, with significant operations in both China and the US. Geely and BAIC, which is controlled by the Chinese state, own a fifth of shares in Mercedes-Benz. The carmaker also relies on the Chinese market for about 30 per cent of its global sales.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has held his first call with China’s President Xi Jinping since leaving the White House in 2021, with the two leaders discussing the fate of TikTok just before the Supreme Court upheld a law to ban the app in the US.\n\nThe conversation between the leaders was their first in four years and came just two days before the law is due to take effect, forcing app stores to stop offering it to users.\n\n“I just spoke to Chairman Xi Jinping of China. The call was a very good one for both China and the U.S.A.,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform on Friday. “We discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects. President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!”\n\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the two leaders agreed to “set up a channel of strategic communication to keep in regular touch on major issues of shared interest”.\n\nWhile it painted a positive picture of the call, the ministry said Xi warned Trump that the US should approach the “Taiwan question” with “prudence”.\n\nBeijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has refused to rule out using force to occupy the island.\n\nTrump’s incoming national security team has been in contact with Beijing, but the call between the Chinese leader and incoming US president marks the first direct conversation between the men in four years.\n\nThe call comes three days before Trump is inaugurated at a ceremony that will be attended by China’s vice-president Han Zheng, marking the first time a top Chinese official has attended a US inauguration.\n\nThe Financial Times reported last week that Xi would send an envoy to Washington after Trump invited the Chinese leader to attend the event.\n\nSome Trump advisers had hoped Beijing would send Cai Qi, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee who is very close to Xi and wields much more power than Han, who sometimes stands in for Xi in ceremonial roles.\n\nWashington and Beijing are waiting to see what kind of China policy Trump will unveil at the start of his administration. He has threatened to impose tariffs on imports from China and many other countries but it is unclear whether he will do so to gain leverage for negotiations with Beijing or whether he will start negotiations over a possible trade deal with China and apply tariffs if the talks are not successful.\n\nThe conversation comes two days before US app stores are obliged to stop carrying TikTok, the video-sharing app that has been downloaded by more than 170mn Americans. The law — upheld in a Supreme Court ruling on Friday morning — bans the app unless its Chinese owner ByteDance sells the platform.\n\nTrump has expressed support for TikTok, raising questions about whether his administration will prosecute companies that violate the law.\n\nUS-China relations plummeted to their lowest point since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979 during the Biden administration over issues ranging from US export controls to differences over Taiwan.\n\nWhile Biden and Xi succeeded in partially stabilising relations over the past year, the countries remain at loggerheads over a range of issues, including Chinese support for Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrump has named several vocal China hawks to serve in his administration, including Mike Waltz as US national security adviser and Marco Rubio as secretary of state.\n\nScott Bessent, the nominee for Treasury secretary, this week said Trump would push China to buy more US agricultural produce, such as corn and soyabeans which were part of a narrow trade deal he did with China last time.\n\nBessent said Trump would also be aggressive in imposing export controls that would affect China. Beijing has frequently slammed the Biden administration for introducing tough export controls on chips and technology related to artificial intelligence in an effort to slow down the modernisation of the People’s Liberation Army.\n\nBut China experts are watching closely to see if some of the technology billionaires in Trump’s orbit, such as Elon Musk, will attempt to convince the incoming president to take a less tough stance on the issue.\n\nAdditional reporting by Joe Leahy in Beijing",

    "date": "2025-01-1800:00:00.0",
    "body": "TikTok on Friday warned of an imminent blackout for its 170mn US users after the Supreme Court upheld a divest-or-ban law targeting the video app.\n\nThe law compels TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the platform by January 19 — the day before Donald Trump returns as US president — or face a nationwide ban.\n\n“There is no doubt that, for more than 170mn Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,” the Supreme Court wrote in a unanimous opinion published on Friday.\n\n“But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,” it added.\n\nFollowing the ruling, Joe Biden’s administration said the outgoing president would not enforce the ban during his remaining days in office.\n\n“Given the sheer fact of timing, this administration recognises that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next administration, which takes office on Monday,” the White House said.\n\nBut TikTok late on Friday said statements from the White House as well as from the Department of Justice had “failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok’s availability” in the US.\n\nIt added: “Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.”\n\nUnder the terms of the law, without a sale, it will be unlawful for companies to provide services to distribute or host the video app, or they will face fines of $5,000 per user.\n\nIt remains unclear whether tech groups such as Apple, Google and Oracle, which offer such services to TikTok in the US, would take the risk of continuing to partner with the company over the weekend. It is also unclear whether the app could also take itself offline deliberately, to protect its partners.\n\nApple, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social after the ruling that his “decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation”, adding that the court’s decision was “expected, and everyone must respect it”.\n\nIn a video posted on TikTok following the court’s decision, the group’s chief executive Shou Zi Chew gave no reassurances on whether the app would continue to function in the US on Sunday, but lavished Trump with praise.\n\n“I want to thank president Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,” he said, adding the president-elect “truly understands” the platform.\n\nUS attorney-general Merrick Garland said the court’s decision “enables the justice department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponising TikTok to undermine America’s national security”.\n\nDeputy US attorney-general Lisa Monaco said the “next phase of this effort — implementing and ensuring compliance with the law after it goes into effect on January 19 — will be a process that plays out over time”.\n\nTikTok has said any spin-off would be technologically unfeasible, while Beijing has indicated it would oppose any sale.\n\nThe court’s ruling was handed down shortly after Trump on Friday said he had discussed TikTok on a call with China’s President Xi Jinping. It was the first call between the leaders in four years.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling upholds one of the boldest legislative moves of Biden’s term just days before the Democratic president leaves the White House.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump’s incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz said the legislation “allows for an extension as long as a viable deal is on the table. Essentially that buys president Trump time to keep TikTok going”.\n\nChinese officials have held preliminary discussions about whether billionaire Elon Musk — now a close ally of Trump — could broker a deal for the app’s sale, the Financial Times reported this week.\n\nSome potential buyers and partners have been circling and lobbying Trump. These include Frank McCourt, an American media and sports businessman, who has established a consortium of investors that would bid for TikTok through his non-profit entity, Project Liberty.\n\nTikTok chief Chew has mounted a charm offensive to cement Trump’s backing, including plans to attend a “victory rally” for the president-elect in Washington on Sunday and his inauguration on Monday, said two people familiar with the matter.\n\nConcerns Beijing could use the app for espionage or to spread propaganda spurred the law, which was passed with strong bipartisan support last year.\n\nEven though China “has not yet leveraged its relationship with ByteDance Ltd to access US TikTok users’ data”, the top court said, there was “no basis for concluding that the government’s determination that China might do so is not at least a ‘reasonable inferenc[e] based on substantial evidence’.”\n\nTikTok asked the Supreme Court to hear its case after a US appeals court rejected its challenge to the law, as well as its subsequent request to halt the measure pending further court proceedings.\n\nThe company sought to throw out the law by arguing it was unconstitutional and it violated First Amendment protections for free speech.\n\nAdditional reporting by Aime Williams in Washington and Stephen Morris and Michael Acton in San Francisco",

    "body": "Good morning. Another strong retail sales report landed yesterday. Will aggregate consumption ever notice higher interest rates? Unhedged will take off Martin Luther King day and be back in your inbox on Tuesday, at which point there will be a new president and a new collegiate football Champion, the Ohio State Buckeyes. Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.\n\nJudging by the volume of chatter and research reports, Donald Trump’s policy that markets care the most about is tariffs. This makes sense: it could have a direct impact on equities (through prices) and bonds (through currencies). And tariff policy is susceptible, in theory, to the numerical — or pseudo-numerical — analysis Wall Street runs on.\n\nBut because the president-elect has said so much about tariffs, not all of it consistent, investors are left to speculate what the policy will be. In hopes of alleviating some of this uncertainty, we summarise below the public statements of Trump’s key economic appointees on the topic. We leave it to readers to decide which advisers, if any, will have the president’s ear, and which proposals will become policy.\n\nScott Bessent: In interviews, opinion pieces, and in a Senate hearing yesterday, Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary lamented that “free” trade has undermined US competitiveness and created an unbalanced global economy. This is because of “deliberate policy choices of foreign governments”.\n\nHoward Lutnick: Lutnick, Trump’s pick for commerce, is pro-tariff in a similar vein to Bessent.\n\nStephen Miran: Miran, tapped to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, argues the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency is the cause of our global economic imbalances. Normally, the currency of a country that runs a big trade deficit would weaken, making its exports more competitive. But with global demand for the dollar as a reserve, this can’t happen. So the US manufacturing base is being hollowed out and US debts are ballooning. To counter this, he believes:\n\nJamieson Greer: Trump picked Greer, Robert Lighthizer’s former deputy, as US trade representative. Greer’s paper trail is much shorter than the others on this list. That said:\n\nPeter Navarro: Trump named Navarro, a former trade adviser during Trump’s first term, as senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing. Navarro wrote the trade section of Project 2025, the conservative policy playbook written by the Heritage Foundation for the next administration.\n\nKevin Hassett. Kevin Hasset, soon to be director of the National Economic Council, is, like Navarro, a staunch supporter of the RTA.\n\nAll love tariffs. All are interested in using them as leverage. Most are heavily critical of China. All of this fits with Trump’s comments. At the same time, though, they are mostly against blanket tariffs applied at the same level to all countries and all products at the same rate — which is what Trump, at times, sounds like he wants. The market seems to think the advisers, who generally endorse fiddly policies, will have an influence on Trump, who is more of a sledgehammer guy. We’ll see.\n\nSubsidising disaster?\n\nCorrection: This story has been amended to reflect that Peter Navarro was a trade adviser during Donald Trump’s first term, not US Trade Representative as previously stated.",

    "body": "AstraZeneca has overhauled its local management in China in a bid to move on from recent scandals and revive sales after the arrest of its president in the country.\n\nThe FTSE 100 group has appointed new executives to lead its Chinese oncology business, which has come under intense scrutiny over two incidents including alleged illegal sales practices for cancer drugs.\n\nThe scandal ensnared the China president Leon Wang, who the company announced in November had been detained, along with several other employees. AstraZeneca shed more than £15bn off its market capitalisation after reports about an investigation by local authorities.\n\nAlex Lin is replacing Michael Lai as country general manager, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. Lai was one of Wang’s senior managers. Lai has moved to the US to be in charge of a key cancer drug for AstraZeneca and report to the head of oncology, according to people close to the company. Lai did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nThe drugmaker has promoted Mary Guan, who was previously at its Chinese general medicines unit, to lead oncology in China as part of a move to deal with the department, according to one person familiar with the matter.\n\nAstraZeneca declined to comment. It has previously said that it would fully co-operate with the Chinese authorities, and also that Wang was co-operating with the investigation.\n\nThe drugmaker — the largest foreign pharmaceutical group in China by revenues in 2023 — is trying reboot its business in China where insiders report they are expecting a dip in sales due to hospitals being unwilling to deal with the company. The new management will be pivotal to putting AstraZeneca back on course in what was once its most important growth market. China contributed 13 per cent of global sales in 2023.\n\nThe company wants to “show that there has been a clean cut with the old management,” said one person familiar with its position.\n\nAnother person said there are “a lot of changes expected in the China Leadership team but they have not yet been announced”.\n\nAstraZeneca executive Iskra Reic was appointed in early December to take over from Wang, who also ran the international region that includes other emerging markets.\n\n“AstraZeneca has distanced itself from Leon and the other affected employees,” said one person close to the company.\n\nThey added that Wang had been under “a lot of pressure to rejuvenate growth” after China revenues declined in 2022.\n\nAstraZeneca leadership has received no formal explanation from Chinese authorities and has not been able to contact Wang, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has concluded that the probe is about the alleged illegal importation of cancer drug Imjudo through Hong Kong to China — where the drug is not approved — because authorities also detained AstraZeneca’s former head of oncology, Yin Min, who was in charge of the department during the alleged offences.\n\nSeparately, scores of salespeople were convicted over the past two years for medical insurance fraud after the courts found they tampered with genetic test results to ensure lung cancer patients qualified for their drug Tagrisso under a national reimbursement scheme.\n\nThe drugmaker is pinning much of its hopes in China on its breast cancer drug Enhertu, which authorities recently said would be included in the state health insurance scheme.",

    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "China recorded its third consecutive year of population decline in 2024, despite the country’s first increase in births in almost a decade in a year traditionally regarded as auspicious.\n\nFigures released on Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics showed the country recorded 9.54mn births in 2024, compared with 10.93mn deaths. The births figure was up from 9.02mn in 2023 as Chinese families marked the year of the dragon, believed to be an auspicious zodiac sign. Birth rates hit a record low in 2023.\n\nThe increase was the first rise in births since 2016 and left the country with a total population of 1.408bn. India overtook China in 2023 as the world’s most populous country.\n\nChina’s declining population, which fell in 2022 for the first time in six decades, stems from a 1980s policy — ended in 2016 — that limited most couples to having only one child, below the average of 2.1 needed for populations to remain stable.\n\nAnalysts say birth rates have also been depressed by economic pressures as the country grapples with slowing growth.\n\nThe declining population has wide-reaching implications for the economy, with the working-age population shrinking, piling pressure on labour productivity. The UN forecasts that China’s population could decline to just over 1.3bn by 2050, while the number of people aged 65 or over is predicted to nearly double.\n\n“[The data] just reinforces the new demographic paradigm that China finds itself in,” said Stuart Gietel-Basten, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “Population decline is not a blip, this is the new normal.”\n\nPolicymakers are pursuing alternatives such as automation and robotics to maintain high levels of productivity, as well as seeking to encourage couples to have more children through a mix of subsidies, tax breaks and cajoling.\n\nWith more than a fifth of the country’s population aged 60 or older, according to official figures, a vibrant “silver economy” has emerged of products and services aimed at the growing elderly population.\n\nBeijing last year unveiled guidelines for the promotion of a market estimated to be worth trillions of renminbi, with a focus on the development of food and healthcare services.\n\nThe state council, China’s cabinet, also announced in October that it was formulating a plan for “birth-friendly society” as one part of wider efforts to stimulate the slowing economy.\n\n“I think that adapting to this new demographic paradigm is a real priority [for policymakers],” said Gietel-Basten. “A lot of policies have already been brought in and they do recognise that this is a challenge but it’s a matter of how far and how fast you can go.”\n\nSteve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute in London, said the high costs of raising children also contributed to China’s demographic decline.\n\nUnless factors such as these change, “the government’s policy to encourage more births is unlikely to have much effect”, he added. “In other words, the prospect is that China’s population will continue to shrink for years, indeed decades, to come.”",

    "blurb": "Analysts and officials warn of threat from tariffs and weak consumer demand",
    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s economy grew 5 per cent last year on the back of surging manufacturing, official data showed, as companies front-loaded exports in anticipation of higher US tariffs and as Beijing stepped up stimulus efforts.\n\nThe economy “recovered remarkably” in the fourth quarter of 2024, said the National Bureau of Statistics, growing 5.4 per cent year on year and rebounding from slower growth in the third quarter.\n\n“With a package of incremental [stimulus] policies . . . confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,” the NBS said in its 2024 GDP data release on Friday.\n\nThe annual figure, which slightly exceeded economists’ forecasts of 4.9 per cent, trailed last year’s growth of 5.2 per cent and was the lowest since 1990, excluding years distorted by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe data comes as Beijing is trying to revive strong growth in a two-speed economy, in which strong exports and manufacturing are offsetting weak household sentiment.\n\nIn September, the central bank announced monetary easing and support for the stock market. Beijing has also launched a programme to refinance local government debt and speed up stimulus spending targeting infrastructure and other areas.\n\nBut economists worry that China is at risk of entrenched deflation. Producer prices have been in negative territory for more than two years, and consumer prices managed growth of just 0.1 per cent in December.\n\nNBS director Kang Yi told a press conference that 2024 could be “described as highly turbulent, marked by intensified geopolitical conflicts and escalating trade protectionism”.\n\nAnalysts expect Beijing to set its official growth target for 2025 at about 5 per cent for the third year in a row when its rubber-stamp parliament meets in March, though trade is expected to face challenges given incoming US president Donald Trump’s threats of higher tariffs.\n\n“The adverse effects of the external environment are deepening. Domestically, insufficient demand persists,” said Kang, adding that “employment and income growth” were under pressure.\n\nRetail sales grew 3.5 per cent last year as consumer confidence remained weak amid a prolonged housing downturn, while industrial output rose 5.8 per cent thanks to strong growth in manufacturing.\n\nResidential property prices slid across China’s largest cities, but new home prices rose in Shanghai.\n\nIn another sign of the country’s long-term structural challenges, China’s population shrank by almost 1.4mn in 2024, the third consecutive year of decline, as a slight rise in births from the previous year to 9.54mn was outstripped by 10.93mn deaths.\n\nWhile China’s economic growth beat expectations, the headline figure “masks some underlying vulnerabilities”, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC.\n\n“The surge in growth was really driven by industrial production, which hints at the support from frontal loading of exports in anticipation of US import restrictions,” said Neumann. “That will inevitably lead to a payback as US import restrictions begin to bite.”\n\nChina’s trade surplus with the rest of the world reached a record of almost $1tn in 2024, customs figures showed last week, thanks to strong export growth as Chinese manufacturers stoked output to make up for sluggish domestic demand. Import growth has remained more modest.\n\n“The current Achilles heel in the Chinese economy is really the hesitant consumer,” Neumann added. “All this points to the need for more stimulus, particularly the need to support consumer spending power.”\n\nThe release also underlined doubts about China’s official data, which some analysts increasingly worry does not reflect underlying weakness in the economy.\n\n“The Chinese government’s ostensible attainment of its growth target is a Pyrrhic victory that further erodes credibility in official data and, at best, reflects an economy still beset by underlying fragilities and loss of confidence in government policymaking,” said Eswar Prasad, professor at Cornell University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley said the better than expected growth in the fourth quarter “could be shortlived”, and could soften from the second quarter due to export front-loading and insufficient stimulus measures.\n\n“We think better data has likely reduced Beijing’s sense of urgency, and policy may continue to undershoot on the housing and social welfare front,” they wrote in a note.\n\nChina’s CSI 300 index of mainland-listed blue-chip companies rose 0.5 per cent in morning trading following the data release, after opening lower earlier in the day.\n\nThe benchmark is still down about 14 per cent from its October 8 peak, when stimulus policy announcements stoked a stock rally.",

    "blurb": "Europeans have come and gone from China’s most populous city, but their food has gone local",
    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "In a private dining room at the Deda, head chef Lu Xiaozhou is chatting enthusiastically about sous-vide cooking and molecular gastronomy. An earnest, bespectacled man of 32, he’s been working in this Shanghai restaurant since he was 18 years old. But while he’s au fait with contemporary culinary trends, Lu is a specialist in a unique local genre: Shanghainese “western food”. The restaurant’s full name is Deda Western Food Society, a reference to the German entrepreneur who founded it in 1897, combined with a 19th-century Shanghainese term for western cooking, “great cuisine”. We meet over cups of milky tea in the private dining room on the top floor, which is decked out in vintage European style with an elaborate mantelpiece and a wind-up gramophone.\n\nYou can eat practically anything in Shanghai these days, from authentic Spanish tapas and Italian pizza, to modernist cuisine by the likes of Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Paul Pairet. Yet locals have an enduring affection for their own “western food”, the legacy of dishes brought to the city by foreigners in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Deda signature dishes include a local version of borscht (luosong tang, “Russian soup”) made with tomatoes rather than beetroot; pork schnitzel with a dip of “hot soy sauce”, a Shanghainese homage to Worcestershire sauce which bears no relation to actual soy sauce; “Portuguese chicken” in curried cheese béchamel; and a Russian-style potato salad made with mayonnaise and dotted with morsels of sausage, carrot and peas. A hefty platter of cured pork and sausages with gherkins harks back to the tastes of the restaurant’s German founder.\n\nThe food recalls an era when foreigners swanned around in extraterritorial concessions that had been extracted at gunpoint from the Qing Dynasty government in the treaties that followed the opium wars. The city was a free port so visas were not required. There were British, Americans, French, Japanese and Germans, among others. Impoverished White Russians fled here after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Later, the rise of Hitler saw an influx of European Jews. The foreigners recreated the west around them, with dance halls and cocktail bars, delicatessens and restaurants, European-style mansions and the grand riverfront buildings of the Bund.\n\nMany did their utmost to avoid Chinese food. Chinese domestic staff were taught how to cook western dishes. The Anglo-Chinese Cook Book, published in Shanghai in 1916 in two volumes (one in English for the employer, one in Chinese for the cook), includes a few Anglo-Indian recipes but not a single Chinese one. Delicatessens sold imported luxury products from Fortnum & Mason and tinned foods that foreigners could take with them on journeys to the interior, so they didn’t have to eat Chinese food there either.\n\nDeda is one of a couple of restaurants that survive from that era (another is the Red House, a favourite of the author Eileen Chang, which is known for its French onion soup and snails or clams in garlic butter). It began as a wholesale shop selling fresh and cured meats and western-style beef dishes, with a German restaurant upstairs that became renowned for its steaks (the Shanghainese themselves traditionally didn’t eat beef because the cow was seen as the farmer’s loyal assistant in the fields).\n\nWhen its original owner returned to Germany in 1910, a Chinese entrepreneur took over and the restaurant continued to flourish. By the late 1940s, it was the largest western restaurant in Shanghai, with a pan-western menu that included not only German, but French, Italian and other western dishes, as well as, at one point, Japanese sukiyaki. It was frequented by celebrities such as the sons of the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek and the businessman and hotelier Victor Sassoon.\n\nThe first western restaurants in Shanghai were designed to cater to the tastes of homesick foreigners, but the Chinese liked them too. Soon they were opening their own establishments, known as fancaiguan (“foreign” or “barbarian” restaurants). By the late 19th century, according to historian Mark Swislocki, author of Culinary Nostalgia: Regional Food Culture and the Urban Experience in Shanghai, they were numerous, and often run by Cantonese businessmen who had encountered western food in Canton (Guangzhou), the first international trading port in China. The term “great cuisine” (da cai), writes Swislocki, seems to have been coined to distinguish the big chunks of meat eaten by foreigners from daintily cut Chinese dishes, although it later came to mean something like “major cuisine”.\n\nEventually, the foreigners left Shanghai, driven out by the Japanese invasion or the 1949 communist takeover. But some of their culinary habits had taken permanent root in the city. Certain dishes, such as the pork schnitzel with “hot soy sauce”, Russian soup and potato salad, had become part of the regular Shanghainese repertoire, while Deda and the Red House had become fixtures of the local dining scene. During the cultural revolution, when foreign culture was banned, Deda was obliged to ditch the western food in favour of Chinese fried buns and noodles. At one point it even became a workshop packaging pills for a local medicine factory. In 1973, having somehow survived the worst years of extremism, it resumed trading as the quintessential Shanghainese western restaurant and Russian soup was back on the menu. When the reforms began in the 1980s, locals used it as a place to entertain foreign guests. It moved to its current location on Nanjing West Road in 2008.\n\nAs a child, chef Lu Xiaozhou dined at Deda with his parents and loved the western dishes. Later, they took him on holiday to Europe, where he enjoyed fish and chips in England and a whole lot of cheeses in France. (“Unlike most Chinese,” he says, “I adore the strong smell and flavour of blue cheese.”) He decided to take a job at Deda because his Cantonese girlfriend (now his wife) was a fan of its food. The then head chef, Lao Jianrong, had worked at the restaurant for 45 years and was a life-long specialist in Shanghainese western cuisine. When he retired in 2022, Lu took over: “This is my platform, and it was a great opportunity to run a restaurant,” he says.\n\nThe kitchen is studiously free of Chinese influences. There is no ginger, regular soy sauce or Shaoxing wine, Lu says, and the chefs ignore Chinese procedures for treating meat and poultry with rice wine and aromatics to refine their flavours. They use western chefs’ knives instead of Chinese cleavers. Outside in the dining room, the tables are laid with knives, forks and spoons rather than chopsticks. In his spare time, Lu has done some modernist cooking experiments, but at work he is more conservative: “As a chef, I like to try new methods and skills, but my guests here won’t accept these kinds of innovations.”\n\nThe first time I visited Deda, I expected it to be a cultural fossil serving a ghastly pastiche of western cooking. Instead, I was charmed. The dining room was buzzy with Shanghainese families having a great time. And while, for a real westerner like me, the menu was a curiosity that would have made no sense in London, or indeed anywhere but Shanghai, the Russian soup, grilled crabmeat in béchamel and potato salad were freshly made and delicious. On subsequent visits I tasted other dishes and chatted to customers. They included elders who had been dining there for decades and young professionals eager for a bit of culinary nostalgia. Sometimes I would sit in the café downstairs, drinking coffee with retirees who spent hours there every day and eating cakes from the in-house bakery. I never saw another foreigner.\n\nIn one sense, Shanghainese western is the equivalent of American and British Chinese food, a resolutely inauthentic cuisine curated to suit the tastes of those outside its original cultural sphere. But while Chinese food in the west is still largely made and marketed by Chinese immigrants, the chefs preparing vintage Shanghainese western are invariably Chinese. Most, like Lu Xiaozhou, have devoted their entire careers to this particular style and have no professional training in the Chinese culinary arts.\n\nThe Shanghainese, long famed for their “Shanghai style” (haipai) culture, an eclectic mix of influences from all over China and abroad, have made these old, classic dishes part of their own culinary tradition. Local bakeries sell palmiers (known in Chinese as “butterfly crisps”, hudie su) alongside Chinese pork-stuffed mooncakes. Sometimes, the palmiers are filled with black sesame seeds or Ningbo seaweed. Shanghainese steamed soup dumpling shops offer pork chops with “hot soy sauce” as a side dish, although here they cut the meat into chopstickable pieces, so it can be eaten with Chinese food. Potato salad and Russian soup are served alongside local braised pork and stir-fried ricecakes with shepherd’s purse.\n\nShanghainese western is not the only version of western cuisines that has been adopted and adapted by Chinese eaters and cooks. The Russians left their culinary footprints in Harbin, near the border with Siberia, in the form of bread and sausages. People in Qingdao have brewed beer since the city was a German treaty port. Best known is Hong Kong’s “soy sauce western cuisine”, a local fusion born from the collision of Chinese and western tastes, with classic dishes including chicken wings in so-called “Swiss” sauce (the name supposedly based on a misapprehension of the English word “sweet”). Casual “tea restaurants” or cha chaan teng in Hong Kong offer a fabulous assembly of localised western dishes, from French toast drizzled with condensed milk to macaroni in tinned chicken soup. Many Cantonese dim sum restaurants serve English-style custard tarts and offer Worcestershire-style sauce as a dip for deep-fried dumplings.\n\nThe opening up of China to foreign influences in the 1990s has also provided new ground for mash-ups of western culinary ideas with Chinese tastes. Outside the contemporary western restaurants, often run by foreigners, you can find pizzas topped with durian, strawberries or chocolate and crisps flavoured with cucumber or steamed garlic shrimp. Unforgettably, a waiter in a small town in Sichuan once brought me a perfect espresso with a side dish of chilli-spiked pickled radish instead of a biscuit.\n\nBut Chinese, like most cuisines, has always been multicultural. Noodles emerged after the adoption from central Asia of the rotary mill for grinding flour some two millennia ago. The sesame-sprinkled flatbreads and syrup-drenched pastries of Beijing are the legacy of ancient Silk Road contacts, while modern Sichuanese cuisine was born of the meeting of an ancient native spice (Sichuan pepper) with a relatively modern American import, the chilli. Each generation adds its own layer of culinary influences.\n\nShanghainese western food is another reminder that the notional borders between cuisines are arbitrary, fragile and porous, and cultural appropriation is the human condition. Humans are like magpies, attracted by bright shiny trinkets and exciting tastes. We steal ideas, whether from our slaves or our oppressors. The politics of the exchange may vary depending on who is doing the appropriating, but the compulsion is always there.\n\nIn ancient China, the people of the central plains despised the hairy barbarians beyond their own cultural pale but couldn’t resist some of their food. In Shanghai and the other treaty ports, the snooty behaviour of colonials may have rankled, but it didn’t stop local people developing a taste for their chunks of meat and buttery pastries. Similarly, in contemporary America, China may be seen as a rival and a possible enemy, but Chinese food is stitched into the nation’s culinary ecosystem and its affections (the enraged slogan “Love our people like you love our food” went viral during protests against anti-Asian racism at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic).\n\nAppropriation happens in all directions, unpredictable and chaotic. The Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce that inspired Shanghainese “hot soy sauce” was, in turn, derived from an Indian recipe that may have incorporated a Chinese condiment: actual soy sauce. The tomato ketchup that appears with some dishes at Deda may be an American import, but its true origins lie in the fermented fish sauces of south-eastern China and their name (ke-tschup) in old Hokkien dialect.\n\nIn 2013, two Americans, one of them of Chinese heritage, opened a restaurant in Shanghai called Fortune Cookie serving something exotic to local palates: American Chinese food, including orange chicken and crab rangoon. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, the restaurant 1908 British Chinese (named for the date when the first Chinese restaurant opened in central London) specialises in dishes inspired by British Chinese menus.\n\nDespite all the evidence, we like to see cuisines as fixed anchors of our identities. Over time, even things that were once novel are viewed as fixed and immutable. People go to Deda for a taste of the past and a sense of continuity between generations. While the menu has evolved, with the addition of chocolate fondant pudding and other more contemporary offerings, Lu Xiaozhou says his job is to preserve the restaurant’s roots in its classic dishes, “which cannot be changed”. “I have a duty to pass these dishes on to my apprentices,” he says. “This is a tradition that has been handed down, and we must certainly preserve it.”\n\nFuchsia Dunlop is the author of “Invitation to a Banquet”, Fortnum & Mason Food Book of 2024\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow FT Weekend Magazine on X and FT Weekend on Instagram",

    "body": "European carmakers led by Volkswagen could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of euros to Chinese electric-vehicle rivals to buy carbon credits, as the auto sector tries to avoid potential fines for failing to meet 2025 pollution rules set by Brussels.\n\nUnder EU rules requiring carmakers to cut emissions, manufacturers lagging behind in the electric transition face the choice of paying billions of euros in fines, boosting EV sales by slashing prices or buying credits from less polluting competitors.\n\nEurope is the fastest warming continent on earth, estimated at twice the global average since the 1980s, in large part because of its proximity to the melting Arctic where exposed dark ground amplifies the effect.\n\nThe European Commission plans to fine carmakers €95 per car for every gramme of CO₂ per km above a 93.6g limit, based on average emissions across a company’s vehicle sales in 2025.\n\nMany carmakers in the EU are looking to use the “pooling” option, where manufacturers average out the greenhouse gas emissions of their fleets with other companies that sell in the bloc.\n\nAnalysts estimate that some European groups may be forced to buy hundreds of millions of euros worth of carbon credits from Chinese rivals such as BYD, which has one of the largest pools of credits to sell thanks to high EV sales in the EU.\n\nAccording to recent EU filings, Tesla expects to pool credits with companies including Stellantis, Ford and Toyota. The US EV maker has already made more than $2bn in the first nine months of last year from selling credits into emission pooling systems globally. In another pool, Mercedes-Benz has teamed up with Polestar and Volvo — both owned by China’s Geely.\n\nGeely’s founder Li Shufu holds about 10 per cent of Mercedes, while Beijing owned BAIC holds another 10 per cent.\n\nMercedes said it continued to “invest billions into electric vehicles”. “However, the pace of the transformation of our industry is determined by market conditions and our customers,” it added.\n\nVW and Renault, which analysts say look likely to struggle to meet targets through their own sales, have few pooling alternatives other than Chinese manufacturers MG-SAIC and BYD. Renault could potentially also pool with strategic partners Nissan and Mitsubishi.\n\nPooling is controversial. Some executives warn that the arrangement will make the European industry less competitive by empowering rivals in China at a time when Brussels has imposed higher tariffs on Chinese EVs to protect the continent’s carmakers.\n\nJens Gieseke, a centre-right lawmaker in the European parliament, said the EU had made a “mistake” in allowing pooling with US and Chinese carmakers as this could benefit European carmakers’ rivals.\n\nIndustry players are reluctant to put numbers on expected payments publicly, as carmakers trade credits behind closed doors in groupings based on a web of alliances linked to their equity stakes and brand tie-ups.\n\nThe German state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 per cent stake in VW while Renault is 15 per cent government owned, making the groups’ pooling with Chinese carmakers a politically sensitive topic, according to UBS analyst Patrick Hummel.\n\nHe added that if VW chose to pool, it would probably need to do so with a number of Chinese companies, as BYD might not have enough EV sales in Europe to fill the German group’s gap alone.\n\nThe German group would need to almost double its EV sales in just one year if it were to meet EU targets itself, according to UBS. The company does not have a new mass-model EV launch planned in 2025. Renault is hoping to boost its EV sales with the launch of a €25,000 model.\n\nVW said it would aim to avoid the penalties through “its own efforts”, pointing to a series of fully-electric models that were launched last year.\n\n“Only in a second step would other measures such as pooling come into play, naturally weighing up costs and benefits,” the company said. “Every euro invested in possible penalties would be a poorly invested euro.”\n\nRenault has said that it was too early to decide on pooling, but added the arrangements with Chinese manufacturers risked weakening the European car industry further.\n\nBrussels is under pressure from the sector to make emissions rules more flexible as sales of electric vehicles in Germany and France fell last year after governments pulled back purchase subsidies for EVs.\n\nThe bloc’s climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra met car industry representatives on Wednesday and a “strategic dialogue” between officials and the sector is due to start this month.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ian Johnston and Patricia Nilsson",

    "event_name": "Is TikTok pushing Taiwan’s young people closer to China?",
    "blurb": "A growing number of researchers fear that the controversial app is promoting pro-China content and softening attitudes towards the People’s Republic",
    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Last spring, pupils at National Chia-Yi Girls’ Senior High School in southern Taiwan were set an unusual topic for their annual essay exam: “How to negotiate with a dictator”.\n\nThe students had to choose the best survival strategy for a small country facing a powerful neighbour — prevent war at all costs, or deter through strength? The exam paper mentioned Russia’s assault on Ukraine, but the unspoken parallels with China’s threat to their own country were obvious.\n\nTeachers say they were stunned when they got the scripts back: nearly all the teenagers argued that Taiwan must do everything to avoid provoking China into attacking it. “Almost without exception, they wrote that, being small and weak, Taiwan must avoid appearing as a threat to China,” says Chu Yi-chun, who teaches Mandarin. “No matter how they harass us, we must tolerate it.”\n\nSuch submissive sentiments are in sharp contrast to those held in Taiwan’s society at large — and young people have traditionally been among the most passionately patriotic and pro-independence citizens in the country.\n\nAccording to data published by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation polling organisation last year, people between 20 and 24 are no longer the age group who feel their Taiwanese identity the strongest, bucking a long-established pattern. And there are indications that, among young people, Taiwan’s decades-old trend towards ever stronger support for independence might also be going into reverse.\n\nThere are many potential reasons for these changes. But for a number of Taiwanese social scientists and ruling party politicians, one of the main causes is TikTok, the controversial Chinese social media app that has amassed more than 1bn monthly active users worldwide.\n\nThe app “cannot necessarily make Taiwanese youth identify with the Chinese nation or agree to unification with China”, says Eric Hsu, a researcher at the Taiwanese think-tank Doublethink Lab who is working on the first systematic survey of TikTok’s impact on Taiwanese society. “But it can probably lower their apprehension towards China and their will to resist.”\n\nIn the US, TikTok is fighting for its survival after a law was passed last year requiring its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, either to sell its stake in the app or face a ban. The deadline is this coming Sunday.\n\nOfficials in Washington have said the platform poses a national security risk because China might coerce TikTok to manipulate information published every day to millions of people in the US through control of the platform’s algorithm. They have also argued that the app allows Beijing to “weaponise America’s data against us” — allegations that ByteDance has insistently and repeatedly denied.\n\nOfficials and researchers in other countries, especially western ones, have raised many concerns about the app, ranging from its addictive effects on children to the ways in which it could be used to sow disinformation.\n\nBut nowhere is the question of whether TikTok is a tool of Chinese political influence as vital as in Taiwan. Beijing claims the island, home to some 23mn people and the world’s largest producer of advanced semiconductors, as part of its territory and misses no opportunity to reiterate its determination to bring it under control — a scenario that the vast majority of Taiwanese people vigorously reject. Ever since the country democratised in the 1990s, its identity separate from China and the determination to preserve its independence has grown more deep-rooted.\n\nTaiwanese educators and researchers fear that the ever greater numbers of children using the app risk being exposed to content that seems innocent, but causes them to look more favourably upon the People’s Republic and feel more negative towards their own nation — something they suspect is a deliberate strategy by Beijing.\n\n“TikTok remains committed to complying with local laws and regulations,” a company spokesperson says in a statement.\n\nThe country’s high school and university students, the first generation of TikTok users, are less politically engaged than earlier generations, says Lin Thung-hong, a research fellow at the institute of sociology at Taiwan’s top research institution Academia Sinica. “Over the past few years, young adults are much less willing to vote,” he says. “We worry that they might turn cold on politics and retreat, and that would have an immense impact on Taiwan’s political future.”\n\n“They are not prepared to fight against China,” says Chu, the teacher. “They don’t feel that we must protect this land.”\n\nAt first glance, TikTok seems an unlikely threat. According to the 2024 Taiwan Internet Report, an annual independent survey, just under 22 per cent of the population use the app, either in its international form, branded as TikTok, or the original version available in China, called Douyin.\n\nThat is the second-lowest proportion in Asia after Japan and little more than a quarter of the percentage in Malaysia, where TikTok has a dominant position. It is also markedly lower than in western countries like the US, Spain, France or the UK.\n\nBut, among young people, the picture changes radically. According to the government-backed Taiwan Communication Survey, 44 per cent of primary school pupils in Taiwan use TikTok, and among junior high school students (typically aged 13-15) usage is close to 60 per cent. The figure levels off only slightly among senior high school students.\n\nWhile a majority of Taiwanese TikTok users are male, among schoolchildren girls are massively heavier users. For many of them, dance is the way in. Yi-an, a 14-year-old from Shih-ting near Taipei, started watching self-recorded dance videos on the platform about two years ago.\n\n“My friends and I all really like these, and at some point I started making my own,” she says. Yi-an now posts short dance routines every few days and is building a following of her own.\n\n“It becomes a key avenue through which they can express themselves and also the main channel through which they build their social lives,” says Chu.\n\nBoth TikTok and Douyin offer content in Mandarin, the national language of both Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. TV dramas, songs, dance styles and celebrities from China, whose population dwarfs that of Taiwan, have a heavy presence.\n\n“Even if they consume American, Japanese, Korean or whatever else on TikTok, they absorb Chinese content most easily,” says Chu. “They include Chinese cultural references and lingo from that content in their speech and writing.”\n\nInitial work done by the Doublethink study suggests this seemingly innocuous content can act as a gateway to less anodyne material. Researchers who set up TikTok accounts imitating Taiwanese schoolgirls discovered that, after a few days of them being served dance video clips, the app’s algorithm started to suggest soft political content. Some were street interviews conducted in Taipei’s trendy Ximending district in which Taiwanese teenagers were prompted to compare Chinese “democracy” with the weaknesses of their own political system.\n\nA study conducted by Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman in Malaysia spotted a similar pattern on RedNote, also known as Xiaohongshu, another rapidly spreading Chinese social media app, on which users test and recommend make-up, restaurants and travel destinations or teach cooking and other skills. Xiaohongshu did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe findings also echo international research on TikTok. A series of studies conducted last year and led by Lee Jussim, a social psychologist at Rutgers University in the US, found that, when compared to other platforms such as Instagram or YouTube, TikTok offered a “disproportionately high ratio” of content favourable to China’s Communist party. Their results indicated that people who used TikTok heavily viewed China’s human rights record in a significantly better light and felt more positive about visiting China.\n\nAs in many countries, observers worry that, because of the way the algorithm works, TikTok users increasingly inhabit echo chambers — but in Taiwan this has an added political charge. “Among our students, TikTok has the effect that everyone retreats into their bubble and is increasingly unable and unwilling to hear what others think,” says Chu.\n\nIt may influence teenage behaviour in other ways. Smaller-scale studies have found that many Chinese slang words have entered Taiwan’s youth lexicon in the past three years. The northern Chinese term “niu” (meaning “awesome”) was unheard of in Taiwan until recently, but now appears commonly on teenagers’ social media feeds and in real life. Other Chinese-influenced memes and games have become commonplace, teachers say.\n\nCashbox, one of Taiwan’s largest chains of Karaoke lounges, now offers a large and growing “TikTok songs” category. Kemusan, a twist-like dance set to an electronic version of a traditional Chinese tune that went viral on TikTok last year, triggered a huge craze in Taiwan.\n\nAll this seems a long way from politics, but seemingly harmless content can have political undertones, say researchers. “There are a lot of people selling agricultural products on Douyin who display their lifestyle of honest, hard work,” says Hsu, adding that young Taiwanese people “think when they see this that, while the Chinese government may not be good, the Chinese people are simple and kind, so I don’t need to feel animosity [towards Beijing].”\n\nTeenagers the FT spoke to acknowledge that the app has an effect on them, but dismiss any suggestion that they are being influenced politically. Several admit that, after using TikTok, they had trouble concentrating and finishing longer assignments. “I know I spend too much time on there, it kind of sucks you in,” says Yi-an with a laugh.\n\nBut she and several friends said it was “nonsense” that they might become more China-friendly.\n\nFor Taiwan, building a sense of national pride took years after the end of one-party rule by the Kuomintang (KMT) in 1991, which had suppressed Taiwanese culture and study of the island’s distinct history.\n\nBut that identification eventually became strong, especially among young Taiwanese. According to the Taiwan Social Change Survey, a multiyear research project run by Academia Sinica, the youngest age cohort consistently had the highest percentage of people identifying as “Taiwanese only”, as opposed to Chinese or both Taiwanese and Chinese: over 80 per cent.\n\nUntil a few years ago, Taiwanese youth frequently described themselves as “naturally pro-independence”. In 2014, during the so-called Sunflower Movement, tens of thousands of students occupied parliament to protest against what they saw as the then-government’s cosy relationship with China. The pro-independence Democratic Progressive party came to power two years later.\n\nBut Taiwan’s political make-up has become more complex recently. Although last year’s elections kept the DPP in power, the opposition took control of parliament, creating political deadlock. Some worry that this makes Taiwan especially susceptible to political polarisation.\n\nA 2022 survey conducted by Austin Wang at the University of Nevada suggested that TikTok had no marked influence on supporters of the DPP or the KMT opposition, which supports closer ties with China. But among people who supported the smaller Taiwan People’s party, which benefited from younger swing voters’ distaste for traditional partisan politics, “whether or not they use Douyin has a significant impact on political attitudes”, Wang wrote.\n\nThe research suggested that opposition to Taiwanese independence was sharply higher among TikTok-using TPP supporters and neutral voters compared with non-TikTok users of the same group.\n\nSigns of growing Chinese influence are all the more noteworthy given that Taiwan’s real-world exchanges with China are shrinking as relations between the two countries have become increasingly hostile.\n\nIn contrast to the 1990s and 2000s, when Taiwanese companies set up tens of thousands of factories in China, investment has been falling for over a decade. Meanwhile, tourism and student exchanges have slowed to a trickle, and the number of Taiwanese people living and working in China has fallen from a peak of over 400,000 a decade ago to half that.\n\nLin of Academia Sinica believes that TikTok and other platforms have filled the information vacuum. “As so many ties are cut, China tries to reach our young people through social media. That leads our youngsters who have never been in China and know nothing about it [to] develop illusions about it, and then they project the dissatisfactions they have with Taiwan on to that illusionary China.”\n\nThe generational divide has been emphasised because many younger Taiwanese people feel at an economic and social disadvantage. During the 2010s, entry-level salaries were stagnant, while house prices have soared, partly as a result of Taiwan’s extended technology export boom. Meanwhile, the country has one of the world’s most rapidly ageing populations, threatening public healthcare and pensions. Younger people are also frustrated with what they see as unsustainable environmental and energy policies.\n\nThese misgivings have already led to disaffection with the two main parties, which they feel have failed to address their concerns, say pollsters.\n\nGovernment officials and experts fret that TikTok is exploiting these cleavages. “We still know very little,” says Lin, “but what we can say for sure is that among Taiwanese users, TikTok heightens feelings of economic dissatisfaction, intensifies tendencies towards depression and undermines people’s confidence that they can participate and make a difference politically.”\n\nEnoch Wu, an activist affiliated with the DPP, suggests a simple solution, popular in party circles, echoing the approach taken in the US: the Taiwanese government should ban the app as a national security threat.\n\nEducators and parents interviewed for this story who are critical of the ruling party supported that view, but opposition politicians have argued that the government must not interfere with free speech.\n\nIn theory, Taiwan has a case. TikTok has not set up a subsidiary in the country but operates only through external marketing companies, an arrangement DPP officials say violates laws requiring media organisations to create a legal entity in Taiwan if they operate there.\n\nAccording to lawyers, Taipei could demand internet service providers and other business counterparts stop working with it. “But it is just impossible politically,” says Puma Shen, a DPP lawmaker and expert in disinformation. “The very moment a DPP government [moved] on this, we’d have the opposition at our throat accusing us of restricting free speech.”\n\nThis debate matters, of course, far beyond Taiwan’s borders. Officials in Taipei question how Washington will actually enforce a ban on TikTok: even if it is blocked or taken off app stores, determined users could easily get access via a VPN. They point to India, where TikTok user numbers have actually increased after the government banned it in June 2020.\n\nOne of the few levers for governments could be barring server companies from working with TikTok, thus denying it the bandwidth needed for smooth livestreaming and video loading, says Shen.\n\nHow Taiwan tackles these dilemmas will be a valuable case study for many other countries. Above and beyond a single app, there are existential questions at stake, insists Hsu. “We need to find an effective way of communicating with our young people,” he says, arguing that banning TikTok would “only shatter their trust in our democracy.”\n\n“Once our society is divided and our democratic system no longer trusted, Taiwan will lose its ability to resist China.”",

    "body": "Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of the interior has warned the US will lose the “AI arms race” to China unless it boosts electricity generation from fossil fuels and stabilises its power grid.\n\nDoug Burgum, a billionaire businessman and former governor of North Dakota, told US senators on Thursday that the country had an “electricity crisis” due to weaknesses in the grid and “roadblocks” stopping companies from building fossil fuel plants that can supply round-the-clock power.\n\nHe added that the Trump administration would allocate more public land to drilling for oil and slash tax breaks favouring renewables companies that produce “intermittent and unreliable power”.\n\n“The sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow,” Burgum said in his senate confirmation hearing, adding that the balance was “out of whack”.\n\nDemand for electricity is growing at unprecedented rates in the US, driven by soaring demand from data centres for artificial intelligence processing — which the Department of Energy predicts will triple in the next three years.\n\n“Without baseload, we’re going to lose the AI arms race to China, and if we lose the AI arms race to China, then that’s got direct impacts on our national security,” Burgum said.\n\n“Right now, we’ve stacked a deck, where we are creating roadblocks for people who want to do baseload [electricity], and we’ve got massive tax incentives for people who want to do intermittent and unreliable.”\n\nBurgum, who endorsed Trump after ending his own 2024 presidential bid, is also tipped to lead the National Energy Council. If confirmed as Trump’s “energy tsar”, he will have sweeping powers to push through the president-elect’s vision to “drill, baby, drill”.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to open up federal land for AI infrastructure with the proviso that power would be drawn from clean electricity sources — part of the Democratic leader’s effort to curb emissions and counter climate change.\n\nBurgum said new technologies such as carbon capture storage could eliminate the emissions produced by fossil fuels — although there are questions around the commercial and technical feasibility of the technology.\n\nThe former governor added that restricting US fossil fuel production would not produce any environmental benefit, as less scrupulous governments would fill the supply gap.\n\n“America produces energy cleaner, smarter and safer than anywhere in the world,” he said. “When energy production is restricted in America, it doesn’t reduce demand, it just shifts production to countries like Russia, Venezuela and Iran — whose autocratic leaders don’t care about the environment.”\n\nThe US is already poised for a boom in natural gas-fired power plants to boost baseload power, with as many as 80 facilities expected to come online by 2030, according to Enverus.\n\nBiden’s landmark climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, tied offshore oil and gas lease sales to new offshore wind leases. When asked whether he would protect offshore wind projects in development, Burgum declined to comment.\n\nTrump has vowed to end offshore wind projects on “day one”.",

    "body": "Washington has blacklisted Zhipu, China’s most prominent start-up developing large language models for artificial intelligence, as the Biden administration looks to consolidate its legacy of getting tough on Chinese tech.\n\nThe Beijing-based company was singled out among China’s leading LLM start-ups as it was added on Wednesday to the entity list, a compilation of companies deemed to be of national security concern and subject to trade restrictions.\n\nWashington alleged that Zhipu was advancing Chinese military capabilities through the integration of AI research. The start-up said it “strongly disagreed” with the US move, which it said “lacked factual basis”.\n\nZhipu, founded by Tsinghua computer science professor Tang Jie, has developed LLMs similar to the ones that power OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It has been working with local governments to deploy services, including chatbots for residents to ask administrative questions about rubbish collection and parking times.\n\nThe start-up has also worked with Chinese and foreign companies with operations in China to deploy their LLMs for products such as tailored AI assistants.\n\nThe addition of Zhipu and several affiliated companies to the list in effect bars them from purchasing most US technology.\n\n“These rules will further target and strengthen our controls to help ensure that [China] and others who seek to circumvent our laws and undermine US national security fail in their efforts,” said commerce secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\nBeijing hit back on Thursday, with the commerce ministry opening an anti-dumping investigation into US semiconductors after local industry pointed out that the Biden administration had given the chip industry “huge subsidies”.\n\nIt also announced a preliminary finding that American clothing maker PVH had engaged in anti-Xinjiang region behaviour, demanding that its representatives come in for further questioning.\n\nOne Zhipu investor said the US move “should not impact Zhipu’s existing operations, and most of its core tech is in-house and has little business overseas”. The investor added that Zhipu being singled out by Washington could conversely “strengthen their positioning within China”, as the government would have a stronger incentive to support its growth.\n\nChinese state groups have stepped in with funding for companies under US sanctions, including AI start-up SenseTime and national champion Huawei.\n\nZhipu is already backed by the state-run National Social Security Fund, Tencent, Alibaba Cloud, the venture capital groups HongShan and Hillhouse and Saudi Arabian fund P7. It received $400mn during a funding round in December.\n\nWhile many of China’s LLM start-ups want to expand overseas, the investor said Zhipu could consolidate its lead by focusing solely on the domestic market.\n\nWashington’s latest action also broadened the range of advanced chips that require licences in order to be shipped to China and introduced export controls on some scientific instruments used by drug developers, such as spectral flow cytometers and some liquid chromatography mass spectrometers.\n\nChinese companies have already been banned from buying Nvidia’s highest-end AI chips critical for model training and deployment, and the US this week introduced new geographical restrictions on the processors in an attempt to stem the black market flow of Nvidia chips to China.\n\nAlso added to the entity list on Wednesday was Chinese chip designer Sophgo, under scrutiny last year for possibly supplying Huawei with processors made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, circumventing US sanctions.\n\nWashington alleged the company was “acting at the behest of Beijing to further [China’s] goals of indigenous advanced chip production”.",

    "date": "2025-01-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK foreign secretary and home secretary have intervened on China’s planning application for an enormous new London embassy, signalling their support while outlining conditions for the proposed site.\n\nIn a joint letter to the Planning Inspectorate for England on Tuesday, David Lammy and Yvette Cooper stressed the “importance of countries having functioning diplomatic premises in each other’s capitals”.\n\nThe intervention came after Rachel Reeves visited Beijing and Shanghai last week to boost economic ties, the first such trip to the Chinese mainland by a British chancellor since 2017. Lammy visited China last year.\n\nLammy and Cooper revealed in the letter that the Metropolitan Police had “withdrawn their objection” to Beijing’s proposal to build the diplomatic complex at Royal Mint Court, near the edge of the City of London.\n\n“On balance, the Metropolitan Police’s public order experts are content that there is sufficient space for future protests without significantly impacting the adjacent road network,” the two senior cabinet ministers said in the letter seen by the Financial Times.\n\nBut the ministers also demanded China agree to changing a “small element of the design” and to giving up diplomatic accreditation of seven other premises spread across London.\n\nHousing secretary Angela Rayner, who will decide whether the embassy is approved, “should not make a decision on this application until a firm plan is agreed on the consolidation of the Chinese diplomatic premises”, they said.\n\nThe Chinese government has emphasised its desire for the new embassy, which would be China’s largest diplomatic mission in Europe, in discussions with London after its initial attempt to gain planning permission was blocked by a local council in 2022.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping raised the matter directly with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, after Beijing launched a new application last summer. The Tower Hamlets local authority previously refused to approve the proposal on both security grounds and because of the impact on local residents.\n\nThe new complex would occupy more than 20,000 square metres of land and far outstrip the size of China’s current embassy in Marylebone, which is built on an 830 sq m plot.\n\nLammy and Cooper’s letter acknowledged that the Metropolitan Police “previously raised concerns regarding the ability of the site to accommodate protests” and that “there remain differences of opinion on where protests would most likely congregate”.\n\nThe letter demanded the removal of plans for “unregulated public access” to Cistercian ruins within the complex, arguing that the diplomatic status of the site could delay authorities responding to a security incident or health emergency, who would need permission to enter.\n\nInstead, Lammy and Cooper said a hard perimeter to the area was needed, with “occasional controlled public access” negotiated between the Chinese embassy and relevant UK authorities.\n\nThe Financial Times revealed in October that Rayner had called in the decision, taking it out of the hands of Tower Hamlets council, and last month that Chinese state enterprises had entered submissions of support for the application to the government.\n\nRayner will decide whether to approve the embassy after receiving a recommendation from the planning inspector. The UK is also seeking to rebuild its embassy in China, which requires approval from Beijing.\n\nLuke de Pulford, executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac), a cross-party group of lawmakers concerned about Beijing, said: “The mask has slipped and it’s now painfully clear that the government is desperate to approve the Chinese application, under pressure from Beijing.\n\n“The national security concerns alone ought to be enough to put a stop to this, but the unanimous will of the local council and residents also matter.”\n\nThe UK’s Labour administration has said it is pursuing a “three Cs” approach to Beijing, vowing to co-operate on global issues, such as climate and health, challenge on subjects like human rights, and compete where appropriate.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: “National security is the first duty of government. It has been our core priority throughout this process.\n\n“That is why the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Home Office submitted written representations to reflect these considerations and to note the importance of all states having functioning diplomatic premises in each other’s capitals.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said the resubmitted planning application had “taken into full consideration the UK’s planning policy and guidance as well as views of all relevant parties. It is a high-quality development scheme”.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “Host countries have the international obligation to support and facilitate the building of the premises of diplomatic missions.”\n\nThe Metropolitan Police declined to comment.",

    "blurb": "Mainland competition mounts as US tech group struggles to introduce AI features on its flagship product",
    "date": "2025-01-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Local smartphone makers Vivo and Huawei leapfrogged Apple to become the top two sellers in the Chinese market last year, dealing a blow to the iPhone maker as it struggles to introduce AI features on the mainland and fight competition from domestic rivals.\n\nApple’s China smartphone shipments slipped to 42.9mn in 2024, 17 per cent lower than the year before, according to market research firm Canalys. That cut its market share by 4 percentage points to 15 per cent. Shipments in the final quarter dropped 25 per cent year on year.\n\nVivo and Huawei’s shipments increased 11 per cent and 37 per cent for market shares of 17 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. The overall smartphone market grew 4 per cent on 2023, with 285mn units shipped.\n\nThe figures come as the US technology company faces growing pressure from local premium smartphone brands, particularly Huawei, which have benefited from patriotic buying and the ability to roll out artificial intelligence-powered features to their devices. The Apple Intelligence service is not available on the Chinese mainland.\n\n“Apple and its iPhone 16 series . . . faced growing competitive pressure from domestic flagship devices,” said Amber Liu, a research manager at Canalys, adding that Vivo had “shown strong momentum” by strengthening tie-ups with operators and employing effective marketing and product strategies “to solidify its position in entry-level to mid-to-high-end segments”.\n\nHaving developed its own chips in recent years, Huawei had resolved some of its earlier supply chain issues and in 2024 upgraded and refreshed its flagship phone series, adding the $2,800 trifold Mate XT, “bringing them traction and attention from high-end customers based in China”, she added.\n\nApple’s overall Greater China revenues fell nearly 8 per cent in its year ending in September. Chief executive Tim Cook visited China three times last year, with the company seeking to navigate the country’s complex regulatory regime and roll out the artificial intelligence features introduced with the iPhone 16.\n\nAnalysts expect a subsidy programme — unveiled this month by the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s state planner — to boost demand for smartphones. As part of the $11bn programme, China will grant subsidies of 15 per cent to people who trade-in old smartphones, tablets and other devices to buy consumer electronics worth less than Rmb6,000 ($818). The basic model iPhone 16 retails at Rmb5,999 in China, though the company has offered rare promotional discounts for its phones in recent months.\n\n“Among the major [manufacturers], we think companies with exposure to Huawei, Honor, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi (by rank) are well-positioned to benefit,” HSBC analyst Frank He wrote in a note last week, adding that the structure of the subsidies meant that owners of phones worth between Rmb3,333 and Rmb6,000 stood to benefit the most. “We see a limited impact on Apple’s supply chain.”\n\nWill Wong, an analyst at the IDC research firm, said Apple’s core challenges in 2024 were driven by its difficulties rolling out AI features, as well as weakened consumer sentiment in China, where buyers sought to save money by looking to brands offering phones for a wider range of prices.\n\n“Consumers have changed after Covid, they are being more cautious,” he said. “The ‘fear of missing out’ sentiment is not that strong any more.”\n\nApple’s performance in 2025, he added, would depend on whether it could navigate China’s regulatory environment to roll out AI features with a “wow factor” and lure buyers away from innovative offerings from Chinese competitors.",

    "blurb": "Government expected to announce GDP expanded about 5% in 2024 but many feel economy is in recession",
    "date": "2025-01-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "China is expected to release economic data on Friday showing the world’s second-largest economy expanded at a brisk pace of about 5 per cent in 2024. Many Chinese are, to put it mildly, unconvinced.\n\n“I don’t know where this growth is supposed to be coming from,” said Hao, owner of a printing and advertising company in Beijing, who asked to be identified only by his surname.\n\n“The authorities can say whatever they want,” he said, suggesting the official data was “blind to reality”. “For me, 2024 has been the worst year in my 20-plus years of running this business.”\n\nEconomists, and even senior officials, have long questioned the accuracy of China’s GDP numbers, which are released by the National Bureau of Statistics and almost always hit annual government targets with uncanny accuracy.\n\nWhile Beijing’s goal of expanding GDP by about 5 per cent year on year for the second year running was modest compared with past decades, such levels would thrill most large countries — particularly if, as in China, they were suffering a deep property sector crisis.\n\nBut for most Chinese people, their experience does not match the growth figures. Many who work in sectors from banking and local government to restaurants and ride-hailing say current conditions feel more like a recession.\n\n“They said 5 per cent growth year after year, but do people feel this growth? For ordinary people, I’m telling you, it’s just about earning enough to get by and not starve,” said a driver for the ride-hailing company Didi in Beijing. “Forget about growth or development.”\n\nAn economist at a Beijing university said many scholars believed the official GDP growth data was often inaccurate by up to plus or minus two percentage points, but in the past two years, the distortion had grown.\n\nHe pointed to China’s consumer price inflation, which has been running at less than 1 per cent for months, and producer price growth, which has been negative for more than two years, as signalling weak demand.\n\n“Middle-class people are losing their jobs for the first time,” said the economist, who declined to be named. “In 45 years, this never happened.”\n\nQuestioning official economic data and discussing negative economic trends has become increasingly sensitive in China. Gao Shanwen, chief economist at state-owned SDIC Securities, said last month that China’s economy might have grown at an average of only about 2 per cent in the past two to three years.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Gao had been banned from public speaking for the comments. People familiar with the matter said Chinese financial authorities had launched an audit of Gao following the remarks.\n\nMany foreign economists also question the official figures. Analysts at US think-tank Rhodium Group said in a research note that growth last year was probably about half the official target, or 2.4-2.8 per cent.\n\nThe collapse of China’s property sector had “sidelined” local government investment and consumption — two important economic engines — in 2024, leading Beijing to announce a series of urgent stimulus measures, they said.\n\nChina’s official data probably exaggerated household and government consumption, as well as gross capital formation, or investment, which they estimated as negative last year compared with a year earlier, the analysts added. These areas have been hit by the property downturn.\n\nThe picture chimes with the experiences of people working in China.\n\nA credit officer at a bank in central Anhui province said the value of the portfolio of outstanding loans he managed had fallen 20 per cent this year. On a recent trip to Hangzhou, capital of the wealthy neighbouring province Zhejiang, he found that a client’s factory, which a year earlier had employed 1,700 people, now had 1,100.\n\n“More people are repaying their loans in advance,” said the credit officer, adding that they found it “more cost-effective” to reduce debt than to invest. He and his wife had also cut back on their own “unnecessary” spending, such as dining out.\n\nEven state-owned companies are not immune. An employee at one state-owned group in southern Fujian province said authorities in Beijing had asked it to expand investment to support the economy in the fourth quarter. In response, the company brought forward spending on a 25-year project.\n\nBut at the same time, it cut salaries — by more than 20 per cent compared with three years ago. “I got promoted at the beginning of ‘24 and my monthly income was still Rmb1,000 ($136) less than in ‘23,” said the employee.\n\nFor many families, the lunar new year holiday this month might bring at least some short-term relief from the tough conditions, as relatives reunite in their hometowns, bringing gifts and red envelopes stuffed with money.\n\nBut not for Hao, whose printing and advertising company suffered a 40 per cent decline in revenues last year and saw profits fall even more. He plans to skip this year’s festivities in his hometown in eastern Shandong province.\n\n“At my age, going back means giving red envelopes to the younger generation, and I simply don’t have the money to do that,” he said.",

    "blurb": "The country’s demand for crude seems to be plateauing sooner than expected. The implications are huge",
    "date": "2025-01-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Amin Nasser, the head of Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, has always had one special customer: China.\n\nIn his 10 years in charge, Nasser has seen the value of Saudi oil exports to China more than triple, to a record $56bn in 2022, a year in which almost one in six barrels that Saudi Arabia pumped was shipped to Chinese refineries.\n\nForeign oil has underpinned China’s economic rise, as the country built the world’s largest car industry from scratch, new railways and air travel networks, and thousands of skyscrapers. In 2022, 72 per cent of its total crude oil supply was imported, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\n“I have no doubt that elevating our relationship to undreamed-of heights would help turbo-charge China’s efforts to meet the hopes and dreams of its people,” said Nasser at last year’s China Development Forum in Beijing.\n\nBut there are now signs that China’s thirst for crude is reaching a peak sooner than expected, a development that has sent shockwaves through the oil market.\n\nThis week, China said its oil imports had fallen nearly 2 per cent, or 240,000 barrels a day, to just over 11mn b/d in 2024 compared with the year before, the first decline in two decades barring the disruption during the Covid pandemic.\n\nChina’s stuttering economy is partly to blame. The country’s ongoing property crisis led to a slowdown in construction, which hit demand for diesel to run heavy machinery, as well as for the petrochemicals used in paint, pipes and insulation.\n\nBut the decline stems from longer-term trends too. There was a boom in trucks switching from diesel to liquefied natural gas, and, most importantly, the rising number of electric vehicles helped to depress sales of petrol and diesel.\n\nSales of both road fuels peaked in 2023, according to China National Petroleum Corp, and will now fall by 25-40 per cent over the next decade.\n\nIn December, Sinopec, China’s biggest refiner, brought forward its forecast for crude oil consumption to reach a peak to 2027, compared with the range it previously gave of between 2026 and 2030.\n\nThe implications of China hitting peak oil are enormous. If Chinese demand is reaching a plateau that would fulfil projections by the IEA of global oil demand peaking before 2030. The forecast sustains hope for the world to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nThe milestone would also shake the global economy. Over the past three decades, China has accounted for half of all growth in the world’s oil demand — some 600,000 b/d.\n\nIf that rate continues to level off, the $500bn that oil companies are spending every year on finding new sources of oil and gas may be far too high. “The jury is out on whether the demand will be there to absorb it or not,” says Martijn Rats, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “The answer may be that it is not.”\n\nIn the markets, the anxiety over China’s weak oil demand last year kept crude prices within their narrowest trading range in over two decades in real terms.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude ended the year at just over $74 a barrel, a few dollars down from the beginning of the year, despite crises in the Middle East, the ongoing war in Ukraine, a shutdown of oil production in Libya, and a more than 20 per cent drop in Middle Eastern crude shipments to Europe because of attacks on tankers in the Red Sea.\n\nIf Chinese oil imports continue to slow, it would fundamentally change the market, says Rats. “If you have slower growth for six months or a year, then you have softer oil prices and supply slows down a bit.\n\n“But if you truly have very little oil demand growth then that is a different oil market in the future than it has been in the past.”\n\nMany oil producers are loath to call this moment a turning point, sceptical that China is fading as an engine of growth.\n\n“It is too early to claim peak oil,” says Meg O’Neill, the chief executive of Woodside, Australia’s largest oil and gas company. She points to the fact that China’s economy still has a long way to go to reach western levels of per capita wealth.\n\n“If you go back over the last 20 years, there have been proclamations of peak oil at points of economic softness, and it’s proven to be incorrect,” she adds. “China still aspires to grow its economy and lift the standard of living and often that has a direct correlation to energy consumption.”\n\nOpec, the oil cartel, has a bullish outlook for China despite last year’s decline in imports, forecasting that consumption will continue to grow, by 2.5mn b/d, from 2023 to 2050. Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern producers tend to rely on Opec’s data when making policy.\n\nSaudi Aramco has also rejected the idea that China is slowing down. “When people talk about China, they are always trying to maximise the downside and ignore the upside,” said Nasser last October at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh. “In general, there is still growth in China.”\n\nNasser insisted there was stronger and more durable demand than official imports data implied, noting that the country’s surging solar and wind power industries still required large amounts of oil.\n\n“For 5 megawatts of wind-generated power you need 50 tonnes of plastics. For every electric vehicle you need 200-230kg of plastic. Even in solar panels, 10 per cent comes from fibre and so on. So for the transition to happen you need more oil,” he said.\n\nSaudi Aramco has said the public information on China’s oil consumption is unreliable. Since the country does not officially report oil consumption statistics, analysts estimate it from a range of sources, including import and export data, the changes in stockpiles and the outflow from refineries. There have been a wide range of estimates, with differences of up to 1mn b/d, even for historical data.\n\nZiad al-Murshed, the company’s chief financial officer, told analysts at the end of last year that significant upwards revisions to 2023’s oil data “makes 2024 growth look less than it actually is. That kind of distorts the picture.”\n\nAt the IEA, analysts acknowledge that assessing China’s oil consumption is “quite challenging”. “It has been a very noisy period for Chinese demand between lockdowns and the return from lockdowns and chasing high growth,” says Ciarán Healy, an oil market analyst.\n\nNevertheless, the IEA continues to forecast that China will hit peak oil by the end of the decade. This is based on two huge, and opposing, structural trends, Healy says.\n\nThe first is the strong rise in the amount of crude oil flowing into China’s rapidly growing petrochemical industry. The second is the more precipitous fall in the amount of oil needed for road transport.\n\n“In the run-up to Covid, the growth [in oil use] was quite broad based; petrochemicals, road transport, jet fuel, everything grew,” says Healy. “Since 2019, petrochemical production has become a bigger factor. On a net basis, all of the growth in oil consumption globally between 2019 and 2023 is actually the growth of petrochemicals in China.”\n\nChina has been steadily building more petrochemical plants in order to become self-sufficient in the plastics, solvents and fibres that its factories depend on.\n\n“Chinese imports of polymers are still really big, but were enormous,” says Healy, referring to the class of chemicals that includes nylon, polyester, polyethylene and Teflon, among others. “The statistic that blows my mind is that the [country’s] imports of polymers are something like 2 to 3 per cent of the world’s oil demand. That’s Germany’s [oil use] in demand terms.”\n\nEchoing Nasser’s remarks, the IEA’s Healy says “probably about a quarter” of China’s increase in petrochemical demand over the past five years has come from wind turbines and solar panels, and says “essentially all” of the growth in China’s oil use going forward will be from the petrochemical sector.\n\nBut the IEA believes that the fall in oil use for road transport will be more significant. “By 2030, three-quarters of cars being sold will be electric, and while you have growth in petrochemical demand, that’s nowhere near strong enough to offset that decrease in road transport,” says Healy. “It will plateau for a while and then start to fall a bit more sharply.”\n\nIn its base case scenario, which extends all of the policies currently in place, Healy says the IEA believes China’s oil consumption will fall from 16mn to 17mn b/d at present to about 12mn b/d by 2050.\n\nChina’s electric vehicles boom, helped by government incentives to trade-in old cars for new, shows little sign of slowing down. The market for pure battery and plug-in hybrids is growing about 20 per cent year on year, compared with a similar contraction in petrol and diesel cars.\n\nBut some question whether the Chinese state will sit back and let peak oil happen. While the “revolution” in electric vehicles is both “profound” and “mind-boggling”, says Victor Gao, chair of the China Energy Security Institute, the government will be gauging the potential impact on its huge, state-owned, oil refining industry.\n\nHe suggests that the country’s state-owned refineries are unlikely to be suddenly deprived of business, but perhaps there would have to be a change in strategy.\n\n“China’s refining capacity is huge. Until now, China has refined petroleum for its domestic use, it does not export refined products. But if China succeeds in this EV revolution, it may decide to refine crude oil into different products for export. That means China’s consumption of crude oil may not necessarily go down, it may hold steady,” he says.\n\nIt is also much easier now for China to line up crude oil supplies, Gao notes, pointing to its deepening energy ties with Russia, which has been a dependable source of cheaper oil and gas since western countries imposed sanctions relating to the Ukraine war.\n\n“This is changing China’s mentality,” he says. “It may be much easier, if the geopolitical risks can be managed, to expand its co-operation with Russia.” In 2023, Russia overtook Saudi to become China’s top oil supplier.\n\nIf China’s oil demand is indeed passing its peak, the consensus is that India’s growth will become the main driver of growth in global oil consumption.\n\nWhile India’s thirst for oil still lags far behind China, Opec believes that the country’s oil use will grow by 1.5mn b/d, roughly three-quarters of China’s additional demand, between 2023 and 2029, while the IEA forecasts Indian oil growth to be 1.2mn b/d by 2030.\n\nThough India has far smaller manufacturing, construction and petrochemicals sectors than China, diesel and petrol car sales have yet to be significantly displaced by electric vehicles.\n\nAccording to JMK Research, a renewables research agency, there were just under 100,000 electric cars sold in India last year, roughly 5 per cent of an electric vehicle market that is led by mopeds and e-bikes.\n\nYet analysts say that rising demand in emerging markets will not come close to matching that seen in China over the past decades. While there is likely to be material growth elsewhere in south-east Asia, the IEA said the performance of these economies would be affected if China’s economic slowdown continued.\n\nOil consumption is growing across Africa and the Middle East, but remains only a tiny fraction of China’s growth in absolute terms. Latin America’s oil use was essentially flat, said the IEA.\n\nIn short, an end to China’s oil boom would be a tectonic shift that is unlikely to be reversed, according to analysts.\n\n“You can say other countries can pick up the slack, and India’s oil demand is still growing, but there was something quite oil intensive about the growth that China has pursued over the last 30 years,” says Rats of Morgan Stanley.\n\nSome may disagree on the exact moment when China’s appetite for oil peaks, but the IEA’s Healy says long-term demand is only going in one direction — and producers and oil-exporting countries need to be prepared.\n\n“It may still be profitable for them to extract oil and gas from the ground and sell it but it will be a huge reduction in their overall income,” he says. “Given how dependent those countries are on oil and gas exports, that would have massive implications.”",

    "body": "Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Australian miner, has pointed to “signs of stabilisation” in the Chinese property market after weak demand from the country’s construction sector hit the price of iron ore last year.\n\nDemand from Chinese steel mills has driven growth for global miners over the past decade, but weakness in the housing market over the past year has triggered volatility in the iron ore price, which dropped 8 per cent during the fourth quarter, according to Rio.\n\nMiners including Rio and BHP have said commodity demand in China has shifted towards manufacturing, renewable energy and electric vehicles.\n\nRio said in a production update on Thursday that the Chinese economy provided “mixed signals” during the period due partly to “headwinds” from the property market.\n\nHowever, the report pointed to November data on home sales and prices as showing “signs of stabilisation” and said there were further improvements in demand from the manufacturing and consumer sectors following government stimulus programmes to boost consumption.\n\nThe company said China’s crude steel production recovered as exports partly offset weak domestic demand.\n\nThe outlook comes ahead of the release of Chinese economic data on Friday.\n\nMore broadly, Rio said the outlook for the US economy remained stable, in contrast to Europe, where the economic outlook continued to be uncertain due to uneven growth and subdued consumption.\n\n“Persistent manufacturing weakness and cross-country divergence make a strong recovery unlikely,” said Rio.\n\nRio is the first of the large global miners to update the market in 2025. Jakob Stausholm, chief executive, said there had been strong progress in delivering organic growth from the company’s major projects, including its Mongolian copper mine Oyu Tolgoi, its Rincon lithium project in Argentina and the Simandou, an iron ore deposit in Guinea.\n\nRio’s iron ore production dropped 1 per cent year on year to 85.7mn tonnes in the fourth quarter. The company warned of higher costs across its Pilbara operations in Western Australia. Copper production grew 26 per cent on the back of its Mongolian project.\n\nRBC Capital Markets said the fourth-quarter update provided a “solid” end to the year, with bauxite and aluminium production ahead of expectations.\n\nRio said in December its investments in new projects would drive compound annual growth of 3 per cent in the production of copper, iron ore and lithium over the next decade.\n\nThe world’s largest miners have been in a race to boost their exposure to metals and minerals needed for the energy transition, including copper and lithium.\n\nRio paid $6.7bn in cash to acquire lithium group Arcadium in October.\n\nMeanwhile, BHP — which tried to buy Anglo American last year to boost its copper exposure — said on Thursday it had completed the acquisition of Filo Corp, a Canada-listed miner with copper projects in South America.\n\nBHP, which paid $2bn for its share of Filo in a joint deal with Canada’s Lundin Mining, said it was “an exciting new copper growth opportunity”.",

    "blurb": "Chinese demand for steel and iron ore has finally peaked. The industry hopes the energy transition will spark a new boom, but it will be shaped by geopolitical competition",
    "date": "2025-01-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Waking from a nap at his desk, Xiao, a steel trader from Wuhan in central China, reflects on how, at the end of one of the greatest booms in recent economic history, he is a lucky survivor.\n\nAbout half of his competitors in this gritty office park, built near the site of China’s first iron works, have gone bust during the country’s three-year-long property crisis. The park itself is overshadowed by the enormous concrete skeleton of an unfinished real estate project.\n\n“The decline was quite severe in the first half of [last] year,” says Xiao, referring to the price of rebar, a steel product used in construction to reinforce concrete. A government pivot towards economic stimulus which began in the autumn has yet to reignite real estate construction, he says. “Demand is still poor.”\n\nWuhan is the birthplace of China’s steel industry, which rode the country’s meteoric development in recent decades to become the biggest in the world.\n\nThe scale of Chinese appetite for steel has been epic. As China built up its cities, according to government data, the country consumed twice as much of the metal in the two decades from 2000 to 2020 as the US did during the entire 20th century.\n\nThis massive industrialisation and urbanisation, at a pace the world had never seen before, drove a huge commodities supercycle. It sent prices of raw materials like iron ore and steelmaking coal skyrocketing, and profoundly reshaped the global mining and energy industries.\n\nBut that supercycle, which started to wane during the Covid-19 pandemic, has now finally come to an end. Last year China’s steel production fell to a four-year low, and is expected to shrink again this year. The country’s consumption of iron ore, a key ingredient for making steel and iron, declined last year after peaking in 2023, according to Macquarie. There are even some indications that Chinese demand for oil is starting to peak — well before most forecasts said it would.\n\nSteele Li, vice-chair of mining company CMOC, says that the real estate boom that drove the Chinese economy has ended. “That engine is over, and I don’t think it will come back, ever. So China’s economy needs to find a new engine, with similar size,” says Li.\n\nWhile Chinese demand has been limping along for several years, especially since the pandemic, some had hoped that the government stimulus measures would lead to a new spurt. But the resources industry has now given up hope of another construction boom, like the ones that accompanied earlier stimulus packages.\n\nExperts quibble about the exact timing of the peak in Chinese demand. But as Tom Price, head of commodities strategy at Panmure Liberum, puts it: “The China commodities supercycle is definitely over.”\n\nFor the countries and companies that rode the wave of the Chinese supercycle for the past 20 years, it is a profound and at times painful shift.\n\n“Is it the end of an era? It does seem like it,” reflects James Campbell, steel analyst at CRU, a commodity data firm. Even with the recent stimulus measures, he says, “there is not really a way to supercharge steel demand further”.\n\nWithin the industry, some executives are hopeful that the end of the China boom is coinciding with the start of a new cycle. Huge investments in clean energy, in China and around the world, have laid the foundation for another, very different kind of commodities boom.\n\nThis next phase will require lots of copper for building out electricity grids, data centres, and renewable power — as well as metals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel for electric vehicle batteries.\n\n“We are between supercycles,” says Peter Toth, chief strategy officer at Newmont, a US-listed gold miner, who previously worked at BHP and Rio Tinto. “We are coming out of the China supercycle and we are still on the edge of the next supercycle, which will be driven by electrification, the energy transition and artificial intelligence.”\n\nHowever, if there is a new boom in commodities, it will take place in a very different global economy — one that is being shaped by competition between Beijing and Washington.\n\nThe China cycle was in many ways the apogee of the era of globalisation: Beijing was able to access open markets to feed its economy with iron ore from Brazil, copper from DRC and oil from Saudi Arabia. The demand in the next cycle, however, is more spread out geographically, with dozens of countries vying for the raw materials to build out their own renewable energy and electricity infrastructure.\n\nThat dynamic means competition over scarce resources will play a much greater role. Already western countries are racing to build their own supply chains, outside of Chinese control, for critical materials such as cobalt, lithium and copper.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the US government has started to intervene in certain mining deals in Africa, in an effort to steer control of crucial commodities towards US-allied companies. The political tensions around the new boom in commodities could become even sharper in Donald Trump’s new term.\n\n“The biggest challenge in the future is the geopolitics,” says Li, of CMOC. “The world is becoming more divided . . . That’s the fundamental issue.”\n\nBack when the last supercycle started, around 2000, the scale of the demand caught everyone by surprise. “China came along and completely changed everything,” recalls Toth, the mining executive, who joined BHP in 1994.\n\nMining giants BHP and Rio Tinto each reported more than $100bn in operating profits from iron ore during the 2000-20 period. Some in the mining industry joke that they were scooping money out of the ground.\n\nBut now the structural and demographic factors that underpinned that boom — China’s rapid urbanisation and industrialisation — have become much less powerful. On a per capita basis, China has already passed the level of annual steel consumption of the US and other developed countries. The vast migration to cities, in which half a billion people moved from rural to urban settings during the boom years, is starting to slow down.\n\n“Peak steel in China has been reached: structurally there is no realistic growth [in steel demand],” says Marcus Garvey, head of commodities strategy at Macquarie Group. Going forward, he expects China’s steel production will “cycle around” current levels of 1bn tonnes annually, with exports helping to compensate for slack domestic demand.\n\nChina’s previous rounds of economic stimulus — including those in 2009, 2013 and 2016 — pumped money into heavy industry and construction, bolstering the steel industry again and again.\n\nBut this time is different. Starting in late September, Beijing announced a series of stimulus measures aimed at helping local governments reduce their debt, rescuing the property market, and loosening monetary policy. While some of these are directed at infrastructure or stimulating consumption to stave off an economic downturn, none of them will have the same big impact on steel. Indeed, most economists argue China needs to rebalance its economy towards household consumption and services. Another steel-heavy construction stimulus is the exact opposite of what is needed at this point in its development, they say.\n\n“There have been a lot of stimulus packages over the years that have kept steel demand going,” says Campbell, the CRU analyst. “But what we see now is that they have reached that limit.”\n\nMany Chinese steel mills have turned to exports to try to compensate for weaker demand at home. Last year China’s steel exports reached 111mn tonnes, a nine-year high. But mounting trade tensions, including with the US, mean there is little room to increase exports further.\n\nOthers have shifted to produce more flat steel products, which are used in the automotive and manufacturing sectors, and fewer of the long steel products used in construction. Manufacturing, including cars, has grown to account for nearly half of Chinese steel demand.\n\n“This year, the manufacturing sector will remain the major driver to prop up China’s overall steel demand,” says Vivian Yang, head of editorial at MySteel, a Shanghai-based commodity data provider. “But still the property sector will be a major drag.” She forecasts China’s steel consumption will fall 2-3 per cent this year, after dropping 3 per cent last year.\n\nSome steel mills have had to close their doors entirely — and about 50 per cent of Chinese steel mills are losing money, according to a MySteel survey this month.\n\nIn the town of Ezhou, near Wuhan, a large privately owned steelmaker, Hongtai Steel, stopped production last year. When the FT tried to visit the plant, a receptionist said “there are no plans to resume production”.\n\nThe company’s slogan, written in huge letters on top of its office block, still harks back to happier times — Gang De Shi Li, Tie De Xin Yu, meaning “Steel-like Strength, Iron-clad Integrity”.\n\nFor the global steel industry, the rest of the world is not able to pick up the slack left by the decline in China. Although demand is growing in India, the world’s second-largest steel producer, its annual domestic output is still just one-eighth of China’s.\n\n“The world has got to get used to slower growth,” says Campbell, the analyst at CRU. He expects global steel demand growth to slow to 0.6 per cent per annum between now and 2050, compared with an average of 2 per cent annual growth over the past 20 years.\n\nIron ore prices, which have been trending down, are expected to keep falling. Macquarie’s Garvey expects iron ore to fall to an average of $80 per tonne next year, from around $140 per tonne at the start of 2024.\n\nThere is a future for iron ore, but it will look different: demand is expected to shift to the higher grades of iron ore used in steelmaking processes that have significantly lower carbon emissions. Within the Chinese steel industry, the downturn could finally provide the impetus to reduce the overcapacity that has plagued the industry for decades, and speed up the retirement of older, more polluting mills.\n\n“Now there will be a process of supply and demand equilibrium, finding a new level,” says Toth, the mining executive at Newmont. “The low-grade seaborne [iron ore] will come out of the market, and you’ll be left with the high-grade.”\n\nEven as steel mills struggle, there are signs of hope for those in the resources sector more generally — particularly when it comes to copper, the metal that is central to the energy transition.\n\nNear Wuhan, in the town of Huangshi, which literally means “yellow stone”, producers of copper products are busier than ever.\n\nHuangshi claims a long pedigree in copper production — with evidence of mining and smelting dating back to the Bronze Age — and is home to several major smelters today. On a recent visit, a warehouse belonging to Youhe Copper was busy with trucks loading huge coils of copper sheet, coming and going late into the evening. “Business is good this year,” says a staff member.\n\nOutside China, the mining companies that made their fortunes selling materials into the Chinese real estate boom have rapidly been reorientating themselves towards what they hope to be a new copper boom. Last year BHP launched a £39bn bid for Anglo American, primarily to get access to its copper assets. And Rio Tinto splashed out nearly $7bn to scoop up a lithium company, Arcadium, to tap into demand for electric vehicle batteries.\n\nAs the energy transition requires more electrical cables, more electric vehicles, and more solar and wind farms, the resulting surge in demand will be huge. Copper demand is expected to increase 50 per cent by 2040, and lithium demand is expected to surge seven-fold by that time, according to the International Energy Agency Net Zero Scenario.\n\n“The only reason these guys are coming up with these strategies is because they know China’s iron ore demand has peaked, and the sector that the iron and steel went into — property and real estate — has also peaked,” says Price of Panmure Liberum.\n\nThe new cycle does not revolve around China, but the country is still one of the driving forces. China remains the world’s largest buyer of many raw materials — and will be the world’s biggest steel producer for decades to come. Its dominance in battery materials is even greater: it controls two-thirds of global lithium and cobalt processing.\n\nThe critical minerals needed for the energy transition are often more niche than the commodities that drove the real estate boom, and lower value in terms of market size. And the trade war between the US and China is encompassing a widening circle of niche metals. After the US introduced export controls aimed at the Chinese semiconductor industry, China recently restricted its exports of gallium and germanium — which are used in certain semiconductor and defence applications.\n\nSome executives fear that the competition over resources could escalate in a dangerous manner.\n\n“I personally think the next war is going to be a war of metals,” says Hugo Schumann, a mining entrepreneur and chief executive of EverMetal, a Denver-based recycling investment firm. “China has so much power, because they have consolidated all the downstream production of these metals.”\n\nEven if few would go that far, there is a growing recognition that competition over resources will shape the new era for commodities.\n\n“There is this collision between the upcoming critical minerals boom and heightened geopolitical tension in almost every part of the world,” says Thijs Van de Graaf, energy fellow at the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics.\n\nVan de Graaf adds that Trump’s recent comments on Greenland and Canada have big implications for critical minerals. “Under Trump, I expect critical raw materials to become part of a more transactional type of geopolitics.”\n\nWhile mining companies see grounds for optimism, many executives are a touch nostalgic for the China boom years.\n\n“At its height, the China supercycle in iron ore was something I’ve never seen,” says Toth. “And will never see again in my career.”\n\nData visualisation by Steven Bernard",

    "body": "Intel will spin off its venture capital unit as the troubled US chipmaker seeks to cut costs and faces more scrutiny over its investments in China.\n\nIntel said on Tuesday it would separate Intel Capital, a prominent Silicon Valley investor that has ploughed more than $20bn into about 1,800 companies since it launched in 1990, into a new, standalone fund.\n\nThe move would bring Intel Capital’s corporate structure “into alignment with other leading venture firms”, the company said. Intel would remain an anchor investor in the new venture fund, which would begin operations under a new name in the second half of the year, it said.\n\nThe fund will now be able to raise capital from external sources for the first time. It had previously relied on a yearly budget allocation from Intel.\n\nIntel’s interim co-chief executive, David Zinsner, said spinning off its venture arm was a “win-win scenario as it provides the fund with access to new sources of capital to expand its franchise while allowing both companies to continue benefiting from a productive long-term strategic partnership”.\n\nThe decision follows a series of cost-cutting measures at Intel after a nightmare year for the company in 2024. Intel shares are down about 60 per cent on a year ago as the company has fallen behind on manufacturing and designing leading-edge chips.\n\nIn December, Zinsner told a Barclays conference that Intel would be constantly “scrutinising where we are spending money and making sure we get the appropriate return”, as the company’s board pushed for “focus” on its core business.\n\nFormer chief executive Pat Gelsinger was ousted by the board in December as tensions rose over his five-year capital-intensive plan to turn the company into a manufacturing powerhouse to rival Taiwan’s TSMC. The multibillion-dollar plan came amid pressure on its core chip design business from competitors such as AMD and Nvidia.\n\nGelsinger was replaced by two interim co-CEOs: chief financial officer Zinsner and product chief Michelle Johnston Holthaus.\n\nIntel Capital has faced scrutiny in Washington over its exposure to Chinese technology companies. The US has sought to restrict flows of capital to Chinese groups, including this month effectively banning investment in companies producing technology such as AI, quantum computing and semiconductors.\n\nSequoia Capital and GGV Capital, formerly two of the largest US venture investors in China, spun out their Chinese businesses in 2023 under mounting political pressure.\n\nIntel Capital has continued to invest in China, owning stakes in 43 China-based technology start-ups as recently as last year, the Financial Times reported. Since the venture fund was launched in the 1990s, it has invested in more than 120 Chinese groups, according to data provider Crunchbase. Its investments have included chipmaker Horizon Robotics and Eeasy Tech, which designs AI chips for facial recognition.\n\nZinsner was the architect of a big cost-cutting initiative announced in September, which paused major manufacturing plans in Germany and Poland and aimed to drastically cut the company’s real estate footprint. It followed an earlier move in August to axe 15,000 jobs.\n\nGelsinger’s departure came just days after the Biden administration threw its weight behind Intel by finalising a nearly $8bn direct subsidy for its manufacturing in the US under the 2022 Chips Act.\n\nIntel is still seeking a permanent chief executive, who will have to confront difficult questions about how turn around the company, including pressure to spin off its manufacturing business.",

    "body": "The EU has threatened to restrict access to Chinese medical devices after finding Beijing has been discriminating against the bloc’s manufacturers in bids for public contracts in the same field.\n\nThe findings, which say Chinese policies force hospitals to choose domestic suppliers, follow a months-long investigation under new EU legislation seeking to prise open overseas procurement markets.\n\nMaroš Šefčovič, EU trade commissioner, said he was seeking talks with Beijing over the issue. But a failure to resolve the issue could lead to Brussels restricting access to EU contracts for Chinese companies for five years.\n\n“While we continue to prioritise dialogue as a first step to finding solutions, we stand ready to take decisive action to defend the level playing field, and support fair competition,” he said.\n\nThe report risks increasing trade tensions between Brussels and Beijing, In October, the EU levied tariffs of up to 45 per cent on Chinese electric vehicles and opened several anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. China responded with anti-dumping tariffs on brandy and investigations into pork and dairy products.\n\nWhile EU imports of Chinese-made devices doubled between 2015-23, the commission said Chinese policies forced hospitals to choose domestic suppliers.\n\nFor the first time Brussels used its International Procurement Instrument, a legislative measure adopted in 2022, in pursuing the probe. If talks proposed by Šefčovič fail to reach an agreement it could reduce or deny access to its own market.\n\n“Any measure adopted under the IPI has to be specific and based on the principles of proportionality and efficiency, while considering any possible supply issues,” a commission statement said.\n\nIts report said high-performance medical devices were one of the 10 core industries identified in Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” strategy.\n\nThere are specific targets for the share of domestically produced high-end medical devices procured by Chinese hospitals, of 50 per cent by 2020, 70 per cent by 2025 and 95 per cent by 2030, the report found.\n\nIt also cited a lack of transparency, with less than a tenth of 380,000 procurement tenders on medical devices between January 2017 and May 31 2024 giving eligibility criteria in accessible form.\n\nOf those, 87 per cent contained “direct and indirect discrimination” including prohibiting imported medical devices.\n\nAfter consultations with Beijing, the commission said it had to act. But Šefčovič added that it “strongly wishes to maintain open, fair and mutually beneficial trade relations with China, including on public procurement”.\n\nCommission officials said China had offered to negotiate a bilateral procurement agreement giving mutual access, but it was not a solution to the problem being investigated.\n\nIn an effort to improve bilateral ties, António Costa, president of the European Council, spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday.\n\n“While agreeing that co-operation is preferable to competition, Costa stressed the need to ensure a level playing field and to rebalance the existing trade and economic imbalances,” an EU official said about the leaders’ telephone call.\n\nAccording to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Xi said “both sides serve as defenders of the multilateral trading system”.\n\n“The two sides should expand mutual openness [and] consolidate existing co-operation mechanisms,” he added.",

    "blurb": "President Claudia Sheinbaum unveils plan to boost domestic manufacturing and cut imports",
    "date": "2025-01-1400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Mexico’s government on Monday launched a plan to shrink its yawning trade deficit with China and attract investment, in an olive branch to Donald Trump’s incoming US administration.\n\nLeftwing President Claudia Sheinbaum outlined “Plan Mexico” to try to boost national production in sectors from textiles to cars and reduce its trade deficit with China, which grew to $105bn in 2023.\n\nThe plan comes as Mexico tries to push back against claims by some American politicians that it is allowing Chinese goods to pass through the country into the US, as Sheinbaum tries to ease trade tensions with the president-elect as he prepares to return to the White House next week.\n\nTrump last year threatened Mexico and Canada with tariffs of 25 per cent on their exports, accusing them of permitting illegal migration and drug trafficking across their borders.\n\nThe two countries have also been moving to align their trade rules with the US to try to limit Chinese imports and investment, as they try to preserve the three-nation USMCA agreement.\n\n“It’s been demonstrated to be one of the best trade deals in history, it benefited the three countries,” Sheinbaum told business leaders at an event in the National Anthropology Museum. “It’s the only way that we can compete with Asian countries, in particular with China.”\n\nMembers of Trump’s team have expressed concern about China’s growing role in Mexico’s economy. Just in the past few weeks, Sheinbaum’s government has imposed new tariffs on imports of clothing and other textiles as well as couriered packages from China.\n\nMonday’s plan includes specific targets such as substituting 15 per cent of sewing thread imports with domestic supplies and promises a development programme for Mexican companies making polymers and wire harnesses for autos and aerospace sectors.\n\nThe USMCA, which was negotiated in Trump’s first term, underpins much of Mexico‘s $36bn annual foreign investment and is up for a scheduled review in 2026. China’s role in the region is among fundamental issues expected to be up for discussion.\n\nAsked about the Mexico plan, China’s foreign affairs ministry responded that it advocated “inclusive economic globalisation” and “win-win results” in trade. It said it was ready to “work with all parties to safeguard” global trade.\n\nCanada has also moved to tighten China’s role in its economy in recent years, including tariffs on the country’s electric vehicles, steel and aluminium that aligned with the steep levies imposed by the US.\n\nMexico had little public debate about China’s role in its economy until recently, with investment and trade growing faster since the Covid-19 pandemic. Its trade deficit with Beijing has also widened to 38 per cent from 2018 to 2023, with large imports in the electronic equipment, vehicle and machinery sectors.\n\nTo counter this, Sheinbaum will need to attract investment by overcoming uncertainty created both by Trump and by her government’s domestic agenda to overhaul the country’s institutions.\n\nOn Monday, she committed to resolving two big question marks in February by publishing the rules for energy investment and for public-private investment in infrastructure.\n\nAlthough she had raised the prospect last year of retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump’s threats, in recent days she has tried to stress that Mexico will have a “good” relationship with the next US president.\n\n“Facing any uncertainty in the near future, Mexico has a plan,” she said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Joe Leahy in Beijing\n\nThis story was updated on January 14 to correct a detail concerning Mexico’s trade deficit with Beijing",

    "body": "The UK and China will study the feasibility of establishing exchange traded fund and wealth management connect schemes to link the capital markets of the two countries.\n\nThe announcement by the UK government follows UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ visit to Beijing last week.\n\nAs part of efforts to improve economic ties with China, the UK government said that both sides had “committed to further their financial services relationship” and would “deepen co-operation” in wealth management by studying the feasibility of establishing a UK-China Wealth Connect.\n\nIt added that the governments would also assess the feasibility of setting up an UK-China ETF Connect scheme to improve capital market co-operation, and welcomed the increased number of UK subsidiaries of Chinese asset managers listing ETFs in London, including those dominated in renminbi.\n\nThe UK government said it welcomed recent licences and quota allocations China had granted to UK companies, including HSBC, Schroders, Abrdn and Aspect Capital.\n\nAspect Capital secured a private fund management licence in December, while Schroders won the final go-ahead to commence its wholly owned fund management business in China in 2023.\n\nThe UK delegation to Beijing included representatives from Abrdn, Fidelity, HSBC, London Stock Exchange Group, Prudential, Schroders, and Standard Chartered, a source familiar with matter told Ignites Asia.\n\nThe announcement also outlined plans to further enhance the UK-China Stock Connect and for the launch of a UK-China over-the-counter bond business.\n\nA Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme was launched in 2019, allowing investors to conduct trades in different time zones across the two bourses but has not garnered the size of cross-border flows that many might have hoped.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference with China’s vice-premier He Lifeng on January 11, Reeves said the two countries had signed agreements worth £600mn that represented “pragmatic co-operation” on financial services, trade, investment and the climate.\n\nReeves added that London was a “natural home” for China’s financial services companies to raise capital, and as a “launch pad” for Chinese companies to build a global footprint.\n\n“Across capital markets, we have opportunities to deepen connections between the UK and China,” Reeves said. “However, as we continue to strengthen our financial relationship, it is crucial that we work together even closer on regulatory co-operation,” she added.\n\nVice-premier He told reporters during the press conference that China would issue an inaugural renminbi-denominated sovereign green bond in 2025.\n\nHe added that China welcomed more qualified UK banks to join the renminbi cross-border payment system and invited qualified UK institutions to apply for licences and businesses in areas such as Treasury bond and futures asset management, over-the-counter derivatives, and pension and wealth management.\n\nThe UK government announced that a joint task force would be established to support the advancement of China’s capital market reforms and opening up, and enhance market attractiveness to international investors.\n\nThe task force will consist of FTSE Russell, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, with support from the China Securities Regulatory Commission.\n\nIn a Treasury policy document on the 2025 UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue that Reeves introduced in Beijing, the UK government highlighted the “essential role” that asset management had to play in “promoting the efficient allocation of capital and supporting growth”.\n\nIn the document, the UK government highlighted a reform from 2020, saying that in recognition of the diversification and risk management private fund managers offered to investors, China had allowed foreign institutional investors to invest in private funds through the qualified foreign institutional investor scheme.\n\nThe policy document also said the two governments would conduct consultations on eligible UK fund service institutions providing services to private fund managers registered with the Asset Management Association of China.\n\nThe consultations will also cover the possible use of a master-feeder fund structure, which will be in line with domestic asset management regulations.\n\nThe UK Treasury said that both parties had agreed that portfolio delegation was an “integral norm” of a financial ecosystem that enabled asset managers to promote efficiency and economies of scale.\n\n“To that end, both sides support deepening co-operation between their respective mutual fund industries and welcome their respective fund management companies to entrust the other party’s financial institutions to manage their overseas investment portfolios or use their services in accordance with regulations,” it read.\n\nChina has been quickly expanding its ETF connect link-ups with other markets over the past few years.\n\nAside from existing agreements with Hong Kong and Singapore, China is also reportedly looking at talks with Saudi Arabia to establish an ETF cross-listing scheme.\n\nThree large Chinese asset managers have paired up with Brazilian counterparts to plan cross-listing ETFs in each other’s market, sources told Ignites Asia last year.\n\nThe Shenzhen Stock Exchange and Dubai Financial Market stock exchange last year signed a memorandum of understanding to promote cross-border investing in China and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n*Ignites

    "blurb": "Shanghai-based Xiaohongshu tops Apple download charts ahead of potential ban on rival this week ",
    "date": "2025-01-1400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Social media start-up Xiaohongshu has seen its Chinese app go to the top of the iPhone’s US download charts, in an unexpected reaction to short-form video app TikTok facing a ban at the end of this week.\n\nXiaohongshu, which translates as “Little Red Book” but is widely known in the US as RedNote, topped Apple’s free-app downloads this week as so-called TikTok refugees flocked to its platform.\n\nOne employee at the Shanghai-based company described the sudden download surge as a “surprise”, as it has no plans for growth through targeting American users and the start-up is focused on consolidating its popularity in China.\n\nMost of its content is in Mandarin, and the app does not have a translation feature to enable new US users to understand posts. The app does not have an official English name.\n\nThey added that the company was trying to capitalise on the sudden jump in traffic and may have to change content review mechanisms if American influencers start uploading posts.\n\n“Xiaohongshu now faces the unique challenge of managing a single platform with both Chinese and western users who have vastly different expectations around content moderation and free speech, while also maintaining compliance with Chinese internet regulations,” said Olivia Plotnick, founder of the social media agency Wai Social.“Rapidly adapting the platform to accommodate this influx of non-Mandarin-speaking users would require significant investment and infrastructure changes that may not align with Xiaohongshu’s current focus.”\n\nNew US users were initially focused on introducing themselves to a Chinese audience, identifying themselves as “TikTok refugees” or “TikTok nomads”. One user named Trini was posting her book recommendations, echoing the “BookTok” community within TikTok, while another user known as “SoCal Masker” wrote in English and Chinese that he was looking “forward to this new opportunity to share my content”.\n\nThe sudden influx of users is largely a symbolic shift led by influencers protesting against the US move to ban TikTok, with several viral posts joking that they were simply switching to another Chinese platform. It “points to rising dissatisfaction with Meta’s platforms, which people presumed would be the beneficiary of a TikTok ban”, said Plotnick.\n\nTikTok’s parent ByteDance is bracing for a potential ban if the US Supreme Court does not overturn a law to block the app unless a non-Chinese buyer is found before the January 19 deadline. The court indicated on Friday that it would uphold the ban because ByteDance has close ties to the Chinese government.For TikTok’s 170mn users in the US, this would not mean the platform immediately disappears, but ByteDance would be unable to update the app and performance would decline.\n\nXiaohongshu is an Instagram-like app hugely popular with young Chinese women, who use the platform for travel, dining and beauty tips. It is an important platform for fashion and beauty brands to reach affluent consumers in cities through promotions in posts or by paying influencers. It has also been steadily growing its male user base.\n\nThe company is profitable and has been one of the few success stories in a Chinese internet sector hit by bankruptcies and falling valuations. Xiaohongshu has been investing in its ecommerce business in China, trying to turn its traffic into new revenue streams. So far, it has struggled to make much of a dent in ecommerce, a heavily saturated market dominated by Alibaba’s Taobao and ByteDance’s Douyin, the Chinese sister version of TikTok.\n\nXiaohongshu did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the summer, Xiaohongshu was valued at $17bn in a secondary share sale in which venture capital firm DST Global bought shares from existing investors. At the peak of Chinese internet start-up valuations in 2021, the company was valued at $20bn in a funding round that included Singaporean state-backed investor Temasek.\n\nXiaohongshu is targeting an initial public offering in Hong Kong, but is waiting for Beijing to clarify its stance towards the overseas listing of large tech companies, the FT previously reported.\n\nThe start-up’s IPO plans are complicated by the wealth of information it holds about Chinese consumers, which could put it in the crosshairs of Beijing’s restrictions on cross-border data sharing.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hannah Murphy in San Francisco and Gavin Huang in Hong Kong",

    "blurb": "Authorities reluctant to clamp down on crucial source of central government revenue",
    "date": "2025-01-1400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Hiding under a parasol from the pouring rain, smoking a cheap cigarette outside the hair salon where he works in Guangzhou, Xu is a typical Chinese smoker: he is male, started young and does not think he can quit.\n\nThe 16-year-old began smoking in his first year of middle school and now gets through more than a pack a day. “At the time, I thought it was fun, really fun,” he said. “Now I’m addicted and there’s nothing to be done.”\n\nUnlike in much of the world, where strict tobacco controls have led to a sharp decline in smoking, research suggests cigarette sales in China have risen in recent years, with analysts pointing to patchy, loosely enforced regulations and authorities’ reluctance to clamp down on a crucial source of central government revenue.\n\nDespite a high-profile push nearly 10 years ago to reduce smoking rates from Xi Jinping, China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, that problem has become more acute as China’s economic growth has slowed, they added.\n\n“The first thing is: it’s a big revenue [generator]. So that’s why all the tobacco control measures are not very highly effective,” said Zhengming Chen, professor of epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford, adding that Chinese men were some of the heaviest smokers globally.\n\nChina produced 2.4tn cigarettes in 2023, with the number having risen in each of the previous five years and gained more than 35 per cent compared with 2003, according to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nFigures from Euromonitor show that the country’s share of global sales rose to about 47 per cent last year from less than 38 per cent in 2009, echoing the findings of other studies tracking tobacco in China. The World Health Organization estimates the proportion of the population aged over 15 that use tobacco products excluding e-cigarettes falling by about four percentage points between 2000 and 2025, much slower than the global average.\n\nThe figures come as China’s economy grapples with a slowdown in growth following a years-long property sector crisis and persistent concerns about weak consumer demand and deflation.\n\n“When China’s economy is in decline, the best thing is to increase the tobacco tax very substantially,” said Chen, arguing that evidence from European markets showed that tripling the price of cigarettes could halve consumption and double revenues. “[But] with the economic downturn, tobacco is always considered as a necessary commodity.”\n\nDespite signing the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003, China has largely left local governments to issue and enforce smoking restrictions independently, leading to a piecemeal framework that is patchily enforced, said analysts.\n\nThey also point to China National Tobacco Corporation, which holds the country’s tobacco monopoly. In 2023, it generated Rmb1.5tn ($206bn) in tax revenue, according to official figures. That corresponds to about 7 per cent of central government revenue, analysts said.\n\nTogether with its regulatory arm, the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, it employs more than half a million people, according to figures from 2016.\n\nIn 2015, around the time Chinese media began reporting that Xi himself had quit smoking, Beijing enacted a citywide indoor smoking ban. Similar measures followed in Shanghai and Shenzhen in 2017.\n\nDespite a flurry of activity and a brief dip in cigarette sales at the time, a push for nationwide legislation has yet to bear fruit, partly due to pressure from the tobacco industry, said Judith Mackay, director of the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control and an adviser to the WHO.\n\n“A bunch of things have happened, but I have to say the tobacco industry was too strong for them,” she said. “It’s just massively powerful.”\n\nThe cost of a pack of cigarettes in China starts from well under Rmb10 and can rise to more than Rmb100. The country does not have laws on plain packaging and only relatively weak stipulations on health warnings. Smokers have a range of ornately packaged brands to choose from, including cigarettes associated with their hometowns or with famous national landmarks.\n\nCNTC’s contribution to government revenue, said Mackay, made it difficult for China to kick its cigarette habit. “It’s a massive amount of money,” she said.\n\nIn 2019, CNTC listed shares of its international affiliate in Hong Kong, using the funds to fuel its global expansion, she added. Those shares are up more than 230 per cent since the listing and about 140 per cent last year alone.\n\nChina’s National Health Commission said the government was promoting tobacco control, noting that 24 provinces and 254 cities had issued their own regulations to control smoking. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to a request for comment. CNTC was not reachable for comment.\n\nFor Fanny Huang, a finance worker in her 40s from Guangzhou who enjoys flavoured, slim cigarettes for Rmb15 a pack, the lack of public smoking bans means there are few incentives to stop smoking.\n\n“I know that overseas there are very few places where you can smoke. In China, there’s no such thing,” said Huang, who began smoking aged 14 and now gets through about half a pack a day. “I smoke whenever I have free time.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Wenjie Ding",

    "event_name": "Pain is coming for emerging markets from a Trump trade war ",
    "blurb": "Investors are still not pricing in enough risks from fallout of US-China tensions",
    "date": "2025-01-1400:00:00.0",
    "body": "The writer is head of emerging markets cross-asset strategy at UBS\n\nAmerican exceptionalism dominates markets, with equities outperforming the rest of the world by 20 per cent last year alone. Yet one indicator, close to Donald Trump’s heart, remains exceptionally weak: the trade balance. We expect this to motivate new, China-centric tariffs. But rather than in China itself, we see larger market moves playing out in the rest of the emerging world for five reasons.\n\nFirst, China is exporting its strongest disinflationary impulse in at least 30 years: its export prices are down 18 per cent from their post-Covid peak compared with a 5 per cent decline globally, according to our analysis of CPB World Trade Monitor data. This de facto real renminbi depreciation is helping exports dominate to a degree unseen since the early days of WTO accession. Chinese export volumes have risen 38 per cent over the past five years relative to a 3 per cent rise globally. This export surge is primarily being channelled into other emerging markets.\n\nThis goes beyond a simple rerouting of Chinese products destined for the US. That wouldn’t explain Chinese export dominance over the rest of the emerging markets world. Instead, it reflects a continued march up the manufacturing value chain and the export of excess capacity. New tariffs would deepen the latter, with consequences for production and capex across emerging markets. Tariffs may be inflationary for the US, but the opposite will be true for those economies.\n\nSecond, tariffs may accelerate a slowdown in Chinese imports that was already coming. Commodity imports have, thus far, decoupled from China’s slowdown amid robust infrastructure and manufacturing investment. New tariffs would exacerbate fiscal pressure and weaken profitability, challenging this resilience. As such, while manufacturing competitors to China have borne the brunt of its slowdown thus far, the next phase of growth deceleration will probably hit commodity exporters, too. Fiscal stimulus won’t compensate. That is tilting towards consumption — positive for the consumer and internet companies that dominate Chinese stocks — but with little spillover to broader emerging markets.\n\nThird, with growth now slowing in large parts of developing economies, markets are in a weak position to navigate a potential Trade War 2.0. Outside China, where we see tariffs driving GDP growth to 3 per cent next year, emerging markets investment is stuck at 2008 levels as a share of GDP. Exports also have flattened out and foreign direct investment is failing to accelerate despite hopes of “friendshoring”. Stronger support in the form of monetary policy easing is needed but persistently elevated US rates limit the ability of emerging markets to provide this without disturbing currencies and, in several cases, credit spreads.\n\nFourth, tariff-sensitive industries such as autos, steel, transport infrastructure and electrical equipment constitute a higher share of emerging markets equities, particularly outside China, than in developed economies. This vulnerability is arguably reflected in Chinese equity valuations, which haven’t recovered from Trade War 1.0 but not in the rest of emerging markets where valuations are 30 per cent higher despite flat return on equity.\n\nFinally, emerging markets outside China also face more challenging trade negotiations with Trump than ever before. US trade deficit composition has shifted dramatically such that China now accounts for “only” 27 per cent while the rest of the emerging markets world constitutes 55 per cent. Deficits with Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand have risen particularly quickly, bringing greater uncertainty.\n\nSome investors believe that valuations already price in such risks after recent underperformance. We disagree.\n\nThe UBS Emerging Markets Risk Appetite Index stands roughly halfway between risk neutrality and risk euphoria — atypically strong relative to the state of global growth. Analysts expect 14 per cent earnings growth in emerging markets in 2025-26 compared with 4 per cent realised during the 2018-19 trade spat. The cost of purchasing protection against even half the renminbi depreciation seen in 2018-19 is in the bottom quartile of a 10-year range. Emerging market credit spreads across all ratings buckets have now compressed to the 18th percentile or lower of their distribution after the financial crisis.The biggest draw for emerging markets is high real rates and disinflation. This provides opportunities in fixed income, particularly currency-hedged local debt. But growth-sensitive assets — equities and especially currency — look vulnerable.",

    "body": "The US is imposing expansive export controls on chips used for artificial intelligence in an effort to make it harder for China and other adversaries to get access to advanced technology with military applications.\n\nJoe Biden’s administration on Monday unveiled an export control regime that gives 20 close allies and partners uninhibited access to AI-related chips while placing licensing requirements on most other countries. The move faced immediate pushback from the US semiconductor industry.\n\nThe policy aims to make it harder for China to use other countries to circumvent existing US restrictions and get technology that can be used for everything from nuclear weapons modelling to hypersonic missiles.\n\nUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan said: “The rule both provides greater clarity to our international partners and to industry and counters the serious circumvention and related national security risks posed by countries of concern and malicious actors who may seek to use the advanced American technologies against us.”\n\nThe regime creates a three-tier licensing system for chips used to power data centres that process AI computations. The top tier, which includes G7 members in addition to countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Ireland, will face no restrictions.\n\nThe third tier includes nations such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea to which US groups can, in effect, not export. The middle tier of more than 100 countries will face caps and licences for export volumes over those limits.\n\nA person familiar with the plans said sales of Nvidia’s H20 series of chips for China — a less-powerful version of the company’s most advanced chips, modified to meet US export controls for Chinese customers — would not be affected by the new controls.\n\nCommerce secretary Gina Raimondo said the policy ensured the new controls did not “stifle innovation or US technological leadership”. But it has provoked a furious backlash from the US semiconductor industry, and the EU has also decried the new rules.\n\nIn a joint statement, European Commission executive vice-president Henna Virkkunen and commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said they were “concerned about the US measures adopted today restricting access to advanced AI chip exports for selected EU Member states and their companies”.\n\nThey added the EU represented “an economic opportunity for the US, not a security risk”, and they would engage “constructively” with the next US administration.\n\nJohn Neuffer, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said: “We’re deeply disappointed that a policy shift of this magnitude and impact is being rushed out the door days before a presidential transition and without any meaningful input from industry.”\n\n“The new rule risks causing unintended and lasting damage to America’s economy and global competitiveness in semiconductors and AI by ceding strategic markets to our competitors,” Neuffer added.\n\nIndustry sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity criticised the move, calling it an unprecedented step that showed Washington was trying to micromanage the global chip supply chain to the detriment of its allies and its own companies such as Nvidia, AMD, Dell and Supermicro.\n\nNvidia said in a blog post: “While cloaked in the guise of an ‘anti-China’ measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance US security. The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\n\n“The new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the US ahead.”\n\nBut Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser to the Rand Corporation, said the rules were an “important framework” that enhanced national security and did not give Chinese AI companies a competitive advantage over US groups.\n\n“Unchecked offshoring of massive AI data centres to countries with questionable ties to foreign adversaries presents clear national and economic security risks,” Goodrich said. “The framework still allows for millions of chips to continue flowing around the world, and concerns about Chinese competition in AI chips are presently overhyped.”\n\nThe industry sources questioned whether the US would be equipped to monitor such an extensive company-specific regime and expressed hope Donald Trump’s administration would roll back the controls.\n\nOne US official declined to comment on what the president-elect might do but stressed “time is really of the essence”.\n\n“We’re in a critical window right now, particularly vis-à-vis China. If you think about where our models are today relative to People’s Republic of China models, the estimates range from being six to 18 months ahead right now, and so every minute counts,” the official said.\n\nOne person familiar with the new regime said it was “nothing if not America First”, in a reference to the mantra frequently used by Trump. “The question is whether the new administration can stick to that, or falls victim to a policy of Petro-autocracies First.”\n\nTed Cruz, the Texas Republican and incoming chair of the Senate commerce committee, last week said the rules would “crush American semiconductor leadership”. He said he was prepared to trigger the Congressional Review Act, which could be used to overturn federal agency actions.\n\nCruz said they had been “drafted in secrecy without input from Congress or American companies”. But Raimondo said the administration had “taken pains and consulted with industry and civil society and experts on Capitol Hill”.",

The country’s trade surplus in December was $104.8bn, a record for a single month and up from $97.4bn in November.\n\nExports rose 10.7 per cent last month on a year earlier in dollar terms, the customs figures showed, while imports climbed 1 per cent, beating average analyst forecasts from Reuters of a 7.3 per cent rise and 1.5 per cent decline, respectively.\n\nIn November, exports rose 6.7 per cent year on year, while imports shrank 3.9 per cent.\n\nThanks to a big policy push from President Xi Jinping — who has vowed to invest in “new productive forces”, or cutting-edge industries — China has also been a leading producer of green-energy products such as solar panels and batteries for electric vehicles.\n\nIt has also grown within a few years to become a global automotive powerhouse, surpassing Japan as the world’s biggest car exporter.\n\nThe country’s trade surplus with the US increased 6.9 per cent in 2024 compared with a year earlier, to $361.03bn, Chinese customs figures showed.\n\nNomura analysts noted, however, that the share of US exports in China’s shipments was gradually declining, to 14.7 per cent in 2024 from 14.8 per cent a year earlier, boosted by the front-loading.\n\nMany manufacturers have also been diversifying production from China to friendly regional countries to avoid trade tariffs and other restrictions. The share of Chinese exports to south-east Asian countries rose 16.4 per cent in 2024, from 15.5 per cent a year earlier.\n\n“The decline in the share of exports to the US and significantly increased share to Asean could provide some buffers to China’s exports against the likely upcoming trade tension,” Nomura said. But it added that if the US targeted rerouting of exports to south-east Asia from China, the region’s share could also be hit.\n\nHSBC economists said the export boost could fade as tariffs set in, posing a challenge for Chinese policymakers wrestling with lagging domestic demand.\n\n“With global trade uncertainties likely to pick up, the front-loading boost may fade and more policy support will be needed to boost domestic demand,” they wrote in a note.\n\nAdditional reporting by Haohsiang Ko in Hong Kong",

    "body": "China is building a new class of mobile piers, satellite images reveal, which could bolster its ability to land an invading force in Taiwan, a major step in its preparations for a potential future attack.\n\nSatellite images captured on Friday and reviewed by the Financial Times show six barge-like vessels equipped with extendable ramps under construction at China’s state-owned Guangzhou Shipyard. The vessels could help the People’s Liberation Army transport heavy military equipment such as tanks and artillery across mudflats or seawalls on to firm ground.\n\nThe construction of the vessels, first reported by defence website Naval News, comes as the PLA is trying to close large gaps in the capabilities needed to launch an attack on Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory and has threatened to annex by force if Taipei resists unification indefinitely.\n\nLast month, China unveiled a new hybrid amphibious assault vessel, the largest of its kind in the world, which military commentators likened to a “light aircraft carrier”.\n\nCalls seeking comment from China’s defence ministry went unanswered on Monday.\n\nAccording to Chinese military academic papers, the PLA would target ports and airports in the event of an invasion of Taiwan to allow it to bring in troops and materiel. Amphibious beach landings would be necessary if that approach failed or fell short, as hundreds of thousands of soldiers would be needed to conquer and control the island.\n\nIn amphibious landing exercises since at least 2020, China’s military has experimented with floating docks and causeways for unloading armoured vehicles and other gear from ferries and other ships.\n\nBut the barges under construction in Guangzhou have several pairs of pylons resembling the legs of offshore oil rigs, suggesting they can be anchored in the coastal silt.\n\n“The PLA has probably come to the realisation that those floating systems are too vulnerable to attack because they take too long to assemble, and also just can’t handle heavy wind and waves as they have no stabilisation,” said Michael Dahm, senior resident fellow for aerospace and China studies at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Washington and a former naval intelligence officer.\n\nChinese military researchers have repeatedly highlighted the importance of stabilised landing gear and the weaknesses of floating systems in papers published in military logistics journals in recent years.\n\n“Such concerns were reinforced by the challenges the US had with its floating pier in Gaza,” Dahm said. The US plan to deliver humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory via a floating pier last summer collapsed after just 20 days, after waves damaged and then broke the specially built, $230mn structure.\n\nAnalysts believe that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan would be one of the most difficult operations in military history. Long stretches of the coast comprise cliffs, reefs and rocks, while the flatter western seaboard is lined with mudflats in which heavy equipment could easily become stuck.\n\nMost of the coastline is also separated from inland areas by concrete seawalls or wave-breaking concrete blocks.\n\nShore-based lifting equipment such as the new barges could help an invasion force overcome such obstacles, analysts said. The satellite images showed mobile piers of three different sizes. The largest, with eight pylons, was 183 metres long and had a ramp extending another 128 metres.\n\nBut military experts said a Chinese invasion force would still struggle to advance through Taiwan’s western plains, which are densely packed with paddy fields, fish ponds and urban sprawl, with wide roads often hard to reach from shore.\n\nTaiwanese observers said the PLA’s new capability reinforced the need for Taipei to target Chinese forces before they reached shore.\n\n“It is their large amphibious assault ships, their helicopters and airborne forces that we must be able to target,” said Lin Ying-yu, an assistant professor at the Graduate Institute for International Affairs and Strategic Studies at Taiwan’s Tamkang University.\n\n“It is like in baseball,” Lin added. “They may have chosen a very good closer, but if we fight well in the first wave, that skill will not come to bear.”",

    "body": "Porsche has revealed a drop of more than a quarter in its deliveries to Chinese customers, as a “challenging economic situation” in the country continues to bite.\n\nThe German sports-car maker said on Monday it had delivered 56,887 vehicles to China last year, down 28 per cent on 2023 and offsetting growth in all other regions, pushing Porsche’s total deliveries down 3 per cent to 310,718.\n\nSliding sales in the world’s largest car market come at a bad time for Porsche’s parent company Volkswagen, which is grappling with declining demand in Europe and lower than expected sales of its electric vehicles, which are facing growing competition from cheaper Chinese rivals.\n\nVW’s management last month backed down from plans to close several German factories following intense pushback from its powerful labour representatives.\n\nSales in China — long VW’s most profitable market — have continued to drop. VW’s eponymous flagship brand, which accounts for nearly half the group’s car sales, said last week that deliveries in China had fallen 8.3 per cent last year amid “intense competition”.\n\nThe poor performance in China came as the Chinese automotive market last year grew 5.5 per cent to almost 23mn new vehicles, according to the China Passenger Car Association.\n\nVW losing its claim to its position as a market leader in China, where consumers are increasingly buying EVs and hybrids from domestic brands such as BYD, Xpeng and Geely, is of growing concern to the company’s shareholders.\n\nThe holding company of VW’s majority owners, the Porsche-Piëch family, warned in December that it expected to write down its stake in Europe’s largest carmaker by up to €20bn — equivalent to 40 per cent — owing to the absence of a financial plan amid negotiations over cost cuts.\n\nPorsche’s lacklustre performance has prompted alarm at the carmaker’s Stuttgart headquarters, with growing concern over chief executive Oliver Blume’s dual role as the head of the sports car brand and VW.\n\nPorsche management has also faced questions from the family over the decision to launch an all-electric version of its Macan SUV, according to one person briefed on the conversations. Sales of the model slid 5 per cent in 2024 as the combustion engine version was gradually discontinued in some markets.\n\nRising competition in China has forced many foreign carmakers to engage in a price war — something Porsche has ruled out.\n\nThe brand reiterated on Monday that it valued profit margins over sales numbers and said it would stick to its “value-based sales approach”.\n\nAdditional reporting by Gloria Li in Hong Kong",

    "body": "Chinese corporate profits are set to show a third consecutive year of declines in 2024, with the trend expected to continue into this year as deflationary pressures weigh on the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nCorporate profits in China for companies with more than Rmb20mn ($2.7mn) in revenue fell by an average of 4.7 per cent year on year between January and November, according to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics. This is greater than the 4 per cent drop seen during the whole of 2022 when the country was under pandemic lockdowns.\n\nRevenue grew just 1.8 per cent year on year between January and November 2024 on the same period in 2023. This compares with 5.9 per cent growth in 2022 on the previous year.\n\nIn addition, 25 per cent of companies in China with revenue of more than Rmb20mn made outright losses between January and November 2024, compared with 16 per cent in the full year of 2019 before the pandemic, NBS data showed. The agency’s data covers 500,000 companies.\n\n“The biggest reason behind that slowdown, I would say, is deflation,” said Laura Wang, chief China equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nFourth-quarter GDP numbers on Friday will show whether the country reached an official economic growth target of about 5 per cent in 2024 amid concerns over a stagnant economy and low consumer confidence.\n\nChina is grappling with a two-speed economy, with strong exports offsetting weak domestic demand as households cope with a deep property slump.\n\nExports in December rose 10.7 per cent year on year in dollar terms, official data showed on Monday, beating average analyst forecasts from Reuters of a 7.3 per cent rise.\n\nBut China’s growing trade surplus — which expanded to nearly $1tn globally last year — has not been enough to offset oversupply among manufacturers, leading to intense competition that is undermining prices for their goods and hitting profits.\n\nThe NBS has reported 28 months of producer price deflation — the price at which factories sell their goods — with economists predicting the trend to continue this year.\n\n“Corporate profitability is wearing thin amid prolonged PPI deflation,” Citi analysts said in a note. “Sluggish end-demand and over-competition could only send profitability lower, weighing on private investment decisions.”\n\nChina’s giant state-owned enterprises were the worst performers in the NBS corporate profits data, despite being heavily promoted by the government of President Xi Jinping.\n\nTheir profits fell 8.4 per cent year on year between January and November, compared with 1 per cent or less for private or foreign companies, the best performers in the group.\n\nThe weakening performance of state-owned enterprises — which are often dragooned by the government into performing various social or geopolitical roles, from buying stocks to supporting Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative international infrastructure programme — was a burden on fiscal resources, analysts said.\n\n“At the current rate of decline, I don’t think they can sustain for many [more] years this kind of policy,” said Lixin Colin Xu, former lead economist in the World Bank’s Development Research Group and an expert on Chinese companies.\n\nChina Association for Public Companies data shows that of 5,368 listed companies in mainland China, 23 per cent reported a net loss year on year in the first nine months of 2024, while 40 per cent reported declining profits and 45 per cent had falling revenue.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Wang said she expected 5 per cent profit growth year on year in 2025 from companies in the MSCI China index, the benchmark followed by international investors, compared with 7 per cent a year earlier.\n\nIn a deflationary environment in which revenue growth was harder to achieve, companies would need to pay more attention to investor returns through mechanisms such as share buybacks and dividends, she said.\n\nPreviously, companies had focused more on reinvesting to capture growth opportunities. “For so many of the past 20 to 30 years, they’ve all been growing and operating under that mindset,” Wang said. “Now they need to change that.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Arjun Neil Alim in Shanghai",

    "blurb": "Washington and Beijing should conduct a joint intervention on the renminbi",
    "date": "2025-01-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The writer is a former US Treasury official and US chair of Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum\n\nThe tensions between US and China are palpable. Washington is filled with China hawks and talons will sharpen with the Trump 2.0 administration. Likewise, Beijing is hardening its posture against the US. Yet the economic and financial fates of the two nations, accounting for over 40 per cent of global GDP, are intertwined. Decoupling is nary impossible.\n\nCurrency feuds have long been a staple of US and China relations. They reached a feverish pitch in the US before the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when China was running a 10 per cent of GDP current account surplus and reserves soared on the back of heavy intervention and a persistently undervalued currency.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis, when its current account surplus came sharply down, Beijing still continued to amass reserves, reaching $4tn. After a period of economic weakness and growth scares in 2015-16 led China to make $1tn in dollar sales from reserves to prop up the renminbi, tensions temporarily quieted. But under Donald Trump in his first term as president, the US Treasury in 2019 designated China a currency manipulator after renminbi depreciation.\n\nThe dollar is now strong across the board. It’s largely a Made in the USA story, reflecting the firm US economy, relatively shallower prospective pace of interest rate cuts, tariff threats and probable fiscal action that will extend the already huge US deficit and supply of Treasuries coming on to the market, pushing up longer-term rates.\n\nTeam Trump believes the dollar is overvalued, as shown in its ham-fisted backing for “devaluation”. The reality is that their aspiration flies in the face of Trump 2.0’s likely macroeconomic and trade policies.\n\nChina also frets about a further weakening of the renminbi against the dollar. Such depreciation could threaten to trigger sharp capital account pressures, reminding authorities of those in 2015-16, an experience they do not wish to see replicated. A weakening renminbi could limit the ability of the central bank to further ease monetary policy in the face of China’s current deflationary pressures and deep-seated economic malaise. Meanwhile, the authorities recognise that Chinese exports hardly need to gain further competitiveness — the real trade-weighted renminbi fell nearly 15 per cent over the past three years. Export volumes are up strongly.\n\nOn balance, I believe China and the US want to see a stronger renminbi against the dollar. Accordingly, China and the US could undertake a joint operation on the currency. They could issue a statement, announcing the operation. At that moment, China’s central bank, which has eschewed direct intervention for years, would visibly enter the Asian markets on its own account with dollar sales/renminbi purchases. While Beijing would undertake the bulk of the intervention, Washington could carry on the operation in London and New York.\n\nWould such a project work? It would surely not tackle the underlying macroeconomic policy drivers and differing cyclical positions in the US and China. Foreign exchange market intervention in major floating currencies is largely ineffective, unless perhaps massive and repeated and/or signalling a change in underlying policies.\n\nBut the Chinese authorities retain significant control of the renminbi on foreign exchange markets. That reality and the effect of an announcement could have a potent impact on the exchange rate and market psychology. One might question whether the impact would endure, but that would need to be seen.\n\nRenminbi depreciation would offset the impact of any large US tariffs on Chinese goods. In contrast, appreciation should limit the need for tariffs. Interestingly, the US would acquire renminbi and might then need to hold reserves in the currency.\n\nSuch an operation is a far cry from fanciful discussions about a Mar-a-Lago Accord, modelled on the Plaza Accord which was premised on macroeconomic policy co-ordination and intervention. That might work in a financial crisis, but not when cyclical conditions vary. For example, Trump is hardly going to forgo extending his 2017 tax cuts to reduce US fiscal deficits and China isn’t going to hike interest rates to prop up the renminbi.\n\nBut despite bilateral tensions, Washington and Beijing have common economic and financial interests. Thinking about the idea could help promote a sliver of co-operation between Team Trump and the Chinese leadership and serve their mutual interests.",

    "blurb": "Cha chaan tengs — frenetic, no-frills eateries where bankers share tables with builders — bring together local dishes and western imports in a uniquely delicious mix",
    "date": "2025-01-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter’s guide to Hong Kong\n\nWhile Hong Kong has seen momentous changes since the handover in 1997, the blend of British and Chinese cultures is ingrained in the city’s DNA. The local identity is neither British nor Chinese, difficult to substitute or erase, and distinctively of its place.\n\nFew things symbolise Hong Kong’s fusion of flavours more than the local diners known as cha chaan tengs, or “tea restaurants”. These humble cafés serve a mix of western imports — French toast is popular — alongside Chinese dishes such as salted fish and chicken fried rice, and a wide array of local inventions combining the two that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else, such as the ubiquitous macaroni and ham soup. They are also characterised by their efficient, no-frills service and frenetic, chaotic atmosphere — typical attributes of Hong Kong life, where every minute is precious and counted.\n\nThe predecessor of the cha chaan teng is the bing sutt, or ice room. Originally from Guangzhou in the 1880s, they were places to enjoy chilled refreshments, their popularity largely attributed to the influx of western expats. The cha chaan teng was a product of that growing demand, offering an affordable alternative to the more opulent cuisine of the British colonial rulers. Today, the cha chaan teng is where blue-collar workers share tables with bankers and lawyers. Its fare has become what a full English is in England or a hamburger in the US: comfort food for the masses.\n\nOn a recent return to Hong Kong, my birthplace, I revisited a few of my favourite cha chaan tengs. Some were iconic eateries and old haunts when I was growing up, and others more recent discoveries. All are unique and delicious in their own ways.\n\nIt’s hard to talk about cha chaan tengs without mentioning what is arguably the most famous of them all: Lan Fong Yuen. Situated on one of the steep hillside lanes in Central, it opened in 1952 and is the oldest tea restaurant around today. Due to its history, long queues are to be expected at almost any time of day, and the crowds can be overwhelming.\n\nThe first thing you see is a rather dilapidated shack blocking the entrance, where waiters are busy pouring cans of evaporated and condensed milk into cups of black tea. What sets Hong Kong-style milk tea apart is its unique brewing method: black tea is repeatedly filtered through a stocking-like cloth bag up to eight times, creating an extra-strong brew, optimal for sweetening. As the owner Lam Chun-chung says: “Making milk tea is a profession.”\n\nI visited on a swelteringly hot April day but could not resist ordering the French toast: a cha chaan teng classic, deep fried and covered with a fat slab of melting butter. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, it’s the epitome of indulgence. I suggest washing it down with yuen yeung, another much-loved Canto-western beverage, which Lan Fong Yuen claims to have invented. This mix of brewed coffee with black tea, milk and sugar is a perfect breakfast pick-me-up.\n\nI grew up in the Tai Hang district, so naturally it holds a very dear place in my heart. Every time I return to the city, I walk along the neighbourhood’s narrow streets, looking for a hearty meal that brings me a feeling of home. I find it at Bing Kee. While the area is experiencing a gentrification-led resurgence, with new construction under way and the arrival of independent cafés and wine bars, Bing Kee has withstood the test of time for some 70 years.\n\nHere, food is prepared in a tin shack and brought out to tables that fill the alleyways, lined up against old and sometimes decaying buildings. Diners sit on plastic stools, slurping down Bing Kee’s signature pork ramen and drinking lemon or milk tea (among the best in town). On my visit, I ordered ramen with pork blood, curry squid and red sausage, a distinctly Cantonese delicacy that was a pungent and savoury reminder of home. I paired the noodles with a peanut butter and condensed-milk toast, another cha chaan teng staple and a personal favourite.\n\nNot far from Tai Hang is Causeway Bay, the premier shopping district in Hong Kong. Hidden between colossal malls and towering skyscrapers is Soul Kitchen, a modern-style cha chaan teng that opened just a few years ago. This is as local as it gets — well liked by Hongkongers in the know. It has become a regular stop for me whenever I am in the city.\n\nSoul Kitchen has won acclaim for its dish of scrambled eggs with XO sauce rice. It’s an ingenious combination of a Chinese way of preparing protein with a western topping. To the rich and creamy scrambled egg the chefs add prawns, an ample dose of sweet soy sauce and a scoop of XO sauce, umami-flavoured chilli paste made from dried shrimps, scallops and peppers. Poured on steamy rice, it’s a delight to behold and a sensation to savour.\n\nAnother highlight is the red bean ice, a dessert drink made of adzuki beans, light rock-sugar syrup and evaporated milk. Cool, sweet and very refreshing, it’s another must-try. But Soul Kitchen is also an excellent place to observe a cross-section of Hong Kong society. Attracting diners from all walks of life, it is where class converges, status dissolves and, for a brief moment, all that is relevant is the food before us that we grew up loving.\n\nWaso Cafe is a popular stop for cha chaan teng enthusiasts in the bustling neighbourhood of Wan Chai, where there is a high concentration of similar venues. Locals descend here for its star offering: pineapple buns. Inspired by Mexican concha, Japan’s melonpan and Portuguese pastries, they are soft on the bottom but crunchy on top, with a thick outer layer of sugar dough. Diners love to slather them with cold butter, which the bread’s warmth slowly melts away. Adding a pork chop or ham is another option.\n\nBut it’s not all about the buns. Waso also does tasty rice and noodle dishes, including pork barbecue with sunny-side-up rice, beef brisket rice with white radish, and beef and pork-liver rice noodles. All of them are great examples of hearty, authentic Hong Kong cuisine.\n\nFrenetic, dynamic and full of life, Waso is a good representation of Hong Kong at its most unvarnished. In a city constantly evolving and adapting, it perhaps most typifies the Hong Kong that I call home.\n\nDo you have a favourite cha chaan teng in Hong Kong? Tell us in the comments below.

    "blurb": "The west needs to co-operate, cautiously, with Beijing in the renewable energy trade",
    "date": "2025-01-1200:00:00.0",
    "body": "The world, it was confirmed last week, breached 1.5C of warming last year for the first time. Climate change is happening even faster than expected. In determining what happens next, China will play a pivotal role. It is now by far the largest greenhouse gas emitter. But it is far ahead, too, in the race for supremacy in green technology. The International Energy Agency expects a striking 60 per cent of all renewable energy capacity installed worldwide between now and 2030 to come from China. It is the leading manufacturer of wind turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries. It dominates the downstream supply chain, too, with its control of critical minerals.\n\nFor western democracies, Beijing’s green ascendance sparks two big concerns. One is that its price advantage — achieved with hefty state support — will drive western rivals out of business and leave governments dependent on a strategic competitor for key technology. The other is that “smart” tech embedded in everything from EVs to turbines could pose security risks. The debate around UK chancellor Rachel Reeves’ visit to Beijing this weekend, over green energy and broader business links, highlights the dilemmas for Europe and the US.\n\nChina’s green advantage has deep roots. It was an early investor in critical minerals. As the energy transition gained steam, it stepped up green subsidies, tax credits and investments. Its annual clean energy investment rose by 40 per cent in 2023 to $890bn, becoming its main growth driver. Its green tech is being heavily deployed at home. Beijing achieved its target of having 1,200 gigawatts of installed solar and wind capacity — enough to power hundreds of millions of homes — six years early. EVs are expected to outsell petrol and diesel cars in China this year, 10 years ahead of its target.\n\nSince China accounts for 30 per cent of global carbon emissions, the rest of the world clearly needs it to be ploughing ahead. But with global 2050 emission targets looking shaky — and the impact of warming becoming more evident, most recently in the devastating fires in Los Angeles — the rest of the world has little choice but to take advantage of low-cost Chinese wind and solar technologies. Limited access to critical minerals and a high cost of capital mean advanced economies cannot now meet their green goals without Beijing.\n\nGiven the risks of over-dependency, it makes sense for the US and Europe to continue developing and diversifying their own green supply chains. But trying to usurp China from behind protectionist walls is expensive and at odds with the urgency of climate change.\n\nChina has a surplus of green tech, so urging Beijing to share more intellectual property in exchange for market access is one approach. Rather than blocking Beijing’s green imports outright, national security concerns could be addressed by more robust tech inspections, ensuring local control over plants using Chinese products, and assessing whether vulnerable “smart” components can be isolated or removed.\n\nRemaining open to Chinese low-cost green tech would allow countries to allocate more resources to areas where they still have comparative advantages. America leads in carbon capture and storage, and has unrivalled climate financing infrastructure. The EU is competitive in high-end climate research and development; in 2020, it issued more patents for green tech than the US or China. Britain is ahead in offshore wind, and Brazil is an expert in biofuels. Trade in these will also expedite the global transition.\n\nChina may be the leader in green tech, but the more important race is the one the planet is running, against the clock, to curb climate change. If it is to win it, countries will need to find strategies to work with Beijing in green tech, while minimising the risks.",

    "body": "Global logistics groups are rushing to relocate Chinese staff as more manufacturers in the country prepare to expand overseas in anticipation of tougher trading conditions with the US under a second Donald Trump presidency.\n\nFrance’s CMA CGM, Switzerland’s Kuehne+Nagel and Germany’s DHL said they were redeploying Chinese staff to Europe, south-east Asia and Latin America, destinations that have been chosen for a “China-plus-one” diversification strategy, in order to better serve Chinese customers abroad.\n\nThe groups, who help clients manage their imports and exports, are responding to manufacturers’ moves to other low-cost production hubs as western buyers and politicians seek to cut imports from China amid rising trade tensions with the US.\n\nCEVA, the logistics arm of CMA CGM, said it recently set up “China desks” in Europe with Mandarin-speaking staff, including sales and customer service specialists. It planned to add more over the next few years.\n\nKuehne+Nagel said it had deployed Chinese staff to Hungary and Slovenia in recent years, mainly to support technology group Huawei with its European operations.\n\nThe logistics provider, which has also relocated staff from China to Vietnam, Malaysia and Brazil, added that it was arranging a “local abroad” event in Shanghai in the spring, bringing in managers from various countries to enable further relocations of Chinese employees and meetings with Chinese customers.\n\nDHL said it had been redeploying more Mandarin-speaking staff over the past few months, including salespeople. They had been sent to south-east Asian countries including Vietnam and Indonesia, with plans on the way to expand the programme to markets such as Hungary, Germany and Mexico.\n\n“We have . . . [identified] a number of countries in the world that benefit from supply chain diversity, China plus one or nervousness about Trump,” said John Pearson, global CEO at DHL Express, adding that employing more Chinese staff overseas would “make sure we are getting our fair share of the [business] in these countries”.\n\nJoanna Zhu, greater China managing director at CEVA Logistics, said employing such staff overseas could help Chinese clients in better “communicating and understanding local politics”.\n\nKuehne+Nagel added that Chinese companies operating abroad “need logistics specialists [who] speak the same language, who have a more proficient understanding of doing business with Chinese customers”.\n\nThe moves by logistics groups come as emerging production hubs such as Vietnam and Thailand are attracting a significant number of Chinese manufacturers, especially those with labour-intensive businesses, according to Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal.\n\nIn the first 10 months of 2024, China was the second-largest foreign investor in Vietnam, with investments worth about $3.6bn, according to Reddal.\n\nDespite Trump’s intention to target goods from China with tariffs, logistics executives said they expected Chinese manufacturers to continue exporting products but from a wider range of countries.\n\nCEVA’s Zhu said Chinese companies and brands would account for an increasingly larger share of business for logistics groups as their operations spread.\n\n“This is a transformation that we will have to undergo,” she said. “And this will happen very quickly . . . so our reaction will also have to be quick.”",

    "date": "2025-01-1200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chinese chipmakers and technology companies are heading to Malaysia in droves, its economy minister Rafizi Ramli said, as Beijing prepares to face more tariffs when Donald Trump returns as US president this month.\n\nThe moves by Chinese companies, which are expected to result in billions of dollars of investment in Malaysia in the coming years, would rival the US companies that have dominated the country’s market, he said.\n\n“Chinese [companies] are very keen to go outside and expand beyond their domestic market,” Rafizi told the Financial Times in an interview. “Those companies are now looking at relocating or expanding into Malaysia.”\n\nTrump has threatened to impose 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports when he re-enters the White House on January 20, rattling investors and putting companies on alert to restructure their supply chains.\n\nMalaysia has been a big beneficiary over the past decade of such “China-plus-one” strategies, where multinational companies complement their Chinese operations with investments in regional countries to diversify risk and lower costs.\n\nIt has also positioned itself as a crucial player in global supply chains for high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence, with long-standing semiconductor manufacturing operations in Penang in the north and a burgeoning hub for data centres in the southern state of Johor.\n\nUS companies have dominated these sectors in Malaysia, but Rafizi said he expected a wave of Chinese investment on the back of initiatives his government was putting in place to develop the industries further.\n\nJoe Biden’s administration has restricted sales of advanced chips by US companies to China, posing a potential threat to their investments in Malaysia, where many of the products are manufactured, and opening the door for Chinese competitors.\n\nRafizi said he made a 10-day trip in June to China, where he met 100 AI, tech and biomedical companies to assess their appetite for investing in Malaysia. He added that these efforts had resulted in two investment delegations from China in the past few months.\n\n“Chinese investments usually come with their own ecosystem,” he said. “We will be seeing more and more, especially if we can secure the first two or three anchor investors from China.”\n\nHe added that many companies were also seeking to increase exposure to the fast-growing south-east Asian market as China’s economic momentum slows and trade with the US faces additional barriers.\n\nThis week, Malaysia signed an agreement with Singapore to create a vast special economic zone between the two countries. Malaysia hopes the initiative will add $26bn a year to its economy by 2030, bringing in 20,000 skilled jobs and 50 new projects.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, Malaysia attracted $21bn of investment into its semiconductor industry and $10bn into data centres — the storage facilities that enable fast-growing technologies such as AI, cloud computing and cryptocurrency mining. In the past year alone, US tech companies Amazon, Nvidia, Google and Microsoft committed nearly $16bn, mostly for data centres in Johor.\n\nTikTok owner ByteDance is the largest Chinese group to invest in Johor, with a $2bn commitment last year.\n\nRafizi said that while historically, Malaysia had been happy to accept any foreign investment, it was becoming more selective as it sought to contribute more value to the products and services it produced.\n\nHe added that while increasing US-China tensions would harm global trade, it could prompt Chinese companies to give Malaysia a bigger role in chip design, rather than just manufacturing, which would generate more income as the country climbed the value chain.\n\n“The unintended consequence of some tariff measures targeted at Chinese companies basically helps countries like Malaysia to weed out the more genuine and long-term investments from China compared to the ones that just look to use Malaysia as a manufacturing outpost,” he said.",

    "date": "2025-01-1100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Rachel Reeves wants to breathe fresh life into a scheme linking the London and Shanghai stock exchanges, as she touts financial services as the “highlight” of Britain’s economic relations with China during a visit starting on Saturday.\n\nThe chancellor will argue for greater co-operation between Britain and China in bonds, pensions and capital markets as well as asset management as she seeks to restart dialogue after a hiatus of more than five years in top-level UK visits to the country.\n\nThe UK government senses an opening to boost financial services ties with China as Donald Trump prepares to become US president after he promised to adopt a tougher stance with Beijing, according to financiers briefed on the trip.\n\nHowever, Reeves’ preparations for the three-day visit to Beijing and Shanghai have been overshadowed by a sell-off in bond markets that this week pushed British borrowing costs to their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Opposition Conservative politicians called for her to cancel the trip.\n\n“We are witnessing an economic mess of Rachel Reeves’ own making, with the impacts of her disastrous Budget continuing to bite. Yet astonishingly she made the choice to get on a jet rather than stay and try to get a grip,” said shadow chancellor Mel Stride.\n\n“The chancellor should turn right back around, and return to the UK urgently,” he added.\n\nReeves said on Saturday after arriving in Beijing that the fiscal rules set out in her Budget in October were “non-negotiable”.\n\nThe chancellor, who visited the Beijing store of UK bicycle maker Brompton, said in comments reported by Reuters that she was in China “to unlock tangible benefits for British businesses exporting and trading around the world to ensure that we have greater access to the second-largest economy in the world”.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the trip, Reeves said she would find “common ground on trade and investment while being candid about our differences and upholding national security as the first duty of this government”.\n\nShe added: “We can build a long-term economic relationship with China that works in the national interest.”\n\nThe City of London is suffering from a dearth of initial public offerings amid a steady flow of UK-listed companies moving their listings to other countries or going private.\n\nBank executives hope Chinese companies that previously would have sought to list in the US may choose instead to sell shares in London if relations between Washington and Beijing worsen.\n\nShein, the Chinese online fast-fashion retailer, filed confidential documents with UK and Chinese regulators last year for a London IPO with a planned market valuation of £50bn.\n\nThis has sparked hopes among financiers that other Chinese companies could follow, despite controversy over allegations that Shein uses forced labour as part of its cotton supply from China’s north-western Xinjiang region.\n\nFinancial Conduct Authority chief executive Nikhil Rathi is accompanying Reeves on the three-day trip and could discuss the Shein listing plans with his counterparts in Beijing. David Schwimmer, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, is also part of the delegation.\n\nReeves saw the meetings as an opportunity to bolster financial services exports to China, given they are currently a fraction of those to the US and EU, officials said.\n\nThe Shanghai-London stock connect was launched with great fanfare in 2019 but has struggled to gain traction since then. It was meant to encourage Chinese and British companies to list their shares in each others’ countries.\n\nBut this has been done by only six Chinese companies, raising $6.6bn, with trading being muted. No UK companies have done so. The chancellor hopes to make such dual listings between the UK and China easier.\n\nThe visit marks a revival of the China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue, an annual set of bilateral talks that has been suspended since 2019 due to both the Covid-19 pandemic and worsening diplomatic relations.\n\nDuring her visit, Reeves will also meet executives from other British companies present in China, including Jaguar Land Rover, Unilever and Diageo.\n\nHSBC chair Mark Tucker, leading the business delegation, and Standard Chartered chair José Viñals are among the senior City of London bankers with sizeable Chinese operations accompanying her this week.\n\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey is also on the trip, along with Baroness Shriti Vadera, chair of insurer Prudential, Sir Douglas Flint, chair of fund manager Abrdn, and Richard Oldfield, head of asset manager Schroders.\n\n​Letter in response to this article:\n\nBritish business naivety on China is nothing new / From Sir John Rose, Former Chief Executive, Rolls-Royce PLC, London SW11, UK",

    "blurb": "After a plague of overcapacity and falling prices, there are signs the sector may be approaching a bottom",
    "date": "2025-01-1000:00:00.0",
    "body": "After years of turmoil — marked by overcapacity, plunging prices and declining investor confidence — China’s solar sector is showing faint but discernible signs of recovery.\n\nIn 2010, Europe’s dominance in the global solar panel market had appeared unassailable. The region accounted for about three-quarters of global solar photovoltaic installations, with Germany leading by a wide margin. Then China decided to break into the market. Its plan worked, perhaps too well.\n\nWhile the People’s Republic managed to snatch market share from Germany, the cost has been a plague of overcapacity and falling prices. Investors have avoided the sector for its unappealing outlook and bleak growth prospects. But there are now signs that the sector may be approaching a bottom.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the extent of slack in the solar industry. China’s solar cell production capacity reached about 1,000 gigawatts last year — not only exceeding current global demand but enough, at the rate of last year’s growth, to exceed total projected demand through to 2035.\n\nAs a result, in the decade through to 2020, the cost of solar panels fell about 85 per cent. Earnings have deteriorated: about a third of China’s listed solar companies reported a loss last year and several went bankrupt.\n\nPotential policy shifts in important markets outside China, notably the US, add to the uncertainty. Subsidies offered under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act could come up for debate under president-elect Donald Trump.\n\nBut there are some signs of recovery. Prices of polysilicon, a vital material for solar cells, rose 2.2 per cent this week compared with the previous week to its highest level since last May, continuing a trend that started in December. Production cuts and declining inventories are starting to yield results. The rapid growth of renewables in important markets such as south-east Asia and India could start to redefine the sector.\n\nChina can help itself, somewhat. As the world’s largest consumer of solar panels, it has been ramping up installation plans through new large-scale projects in the region. This includes China’s “Solar Great Wall” in Inner Mongolia, which is set to transform deserts into renewable energy hubs at an unprecedented scale, adding demand for solar panels. An over-dependence on government-driven demand is no real solution, but eases some pressure as the industry works through its glut of solar panels.\n\nInvestors adjusted to the gloom long ago. Shares of JA Solar Technology and JinkoSolar Holding, two large manufacturers, have sagged by about two-thirds since their 2022 peak. But they are up more than a fifth over the past six months. With the sector seemingly nearing a bottom, it might finally be time to lighten up.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com",

    "body": "Shares in Bloks Group, a maker of Transformers and other toy figurines, as much as doubled on their Hong Kong debut on Friday, making a billionaire of their founder and underlining the surge in ‘kidult’ culture despite falling birth rates in the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nShares in the Chinese toymaker rose as much as 82 per cent on their secondary listing debut in Hong Kong, before closing up 41 per cent, valuing founder Weisong Zhu’s stake at more than US$1bn. The listing, priced at HK$60.35, raised US$215mn for the Shanghai-based company.\n\nThe successful offering represents a boost for Hong Kong’s IP0 market and another example of mainland Chinese companies seeking to raise capital in the territory following secondary listings by groups, including appliance maker Midea and delivery service SF Holding.\n\nAnalysts said Bloks’ achievement highlighted a ‘kidult’ cultural moment where young adults were seeking to rediscover their childhood and toymakers increasingly sought to cater to older demographics.\n\nRetailers that sell pop-culture toys, including collectibles from toymaker Pop Mart, have become high-flying stocks in the market, as “a proxy for Chinese consumption growth, especially among the younger generations”, said Wang Qi, chief investment officer for wealth management at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.\n\n“Retail demand was hot because it’s a consumer deal and a known name, just like Maogeping [a Chinese cosmetics company that went public in Hong Kong last December],” said Jean Thio, capital markets partner at Clifford Chance, which advised on the IPO.\n\nThe listing was heavily oversubscribed for its Hong Kong allocation, as well as its international portion, according to documents filed with the Hong Kong stock exchange.\n\nYet Bloks Group has made a loss since at least 2021, according to its unaudited financial information in its IPO prospectus, with a pre-tax loss of Rmb203,000 in its 2024 fiscal year.\n\nChina’s toy market was worth Rmb159.8bn ($21.8bn) in 2023, according to a recent report from Daxue Consulting, which highlighted the rise of so-called “pop toys” inspired by popular culture. The consultancy pointed to growing demand from Gen Z consumers, including young adults, as a driver for the sector.\n\nMarket research group IMARC expects the market to grow 9.3 per cent a year to hit $47.4bn in 2032.\n\nEnthusiasm for the toy market comes amid a demographic slowdown in China which has seen the number of newborns fall sharply, as well as a wider loss of consumer confidence against the backdrop of a weak property sector. Xi Jinping last month said “vigorous” efforts would be made to boost domestic demand.\n\nHong Kong shares of Pop Mart were up 328 per cent over the past 12 months, beating most members of the MSCI China Index. It also easily outperformed China’s benchmark CSI 300 index, which posted a 14 per cent gain over the same period.\n\nMainland China has seen the number of IPOs plummet in the past year, though a host of new listings from the mainland are expected for Hong Kong, which last year saw its IPO tally increase.\n\nBattery maker CATL plans to launch a secondary listing in Hong Kong, although its inclusion on a Pentagon watch list for its links to the Chinese military may be a setback for its US backers.",

    "body": "Shares in Chinese developer Sunac plummeted on Friday after the company revealed it was the subject of a petition in Hong Kong seeking to wind it up, the latest in a series of legal moves against heavily indebted mainland property groups.\n\nThe company said in a filing that the petition was issued by a Hong Kong unit of Cinda Asset Management, a state-owned bad-debt manager, and that a hearing was scheduled for March 19.\n\nSunac’s Hong Kong-listed shares fell 26 per cent to HK$1.30 (US$0.17) on Friday.\n\nSunac, formerly one of China’s largest developers, defaulted after the 2021 failure of its peer Evergrande sparked a sector-wide cash crunch. The fallout, which paralysed construction projects across China, continues to weigh heavily on economic confidence.\n\nEvergrande, the world’s most indebted real estate company at the time of its failure, with liabilities in excess of $300bn, was the subject of a similar liquidation petition approved by a Hong Kong judge last year, though the vast majority of its assets are within mainland China’s distinct legal regime.\n\nCountry Garden, previously the biggest Chinese developer by sales and initially seen as well-shielded from the crisis, also faces a winding-up petition, with a hearing due this month. The company defaulted on its international debts in 2023.\n\nIt said on Thursday it had proposed a deal to cut $11.6bn from its debt pile, which stood at $16.4bn as of the end of 2023.\n\nDozens of Chinese property developers listed in Hong Kong and issued bonds to finance their activities, though issuance has dried up following the wave of defaults in 2021 and 2022. They also amassed large debts within mainland China.\n\nSunac said in late 2023 that it had received court approval for a $10bn offshore restructuring plan, one of the few of its kind to proceed. It is also in the process of attempting to restructure onshore debts.\n\nMost petitions to wind up indebted developers have been presented by private creditors, although state-owned China Construction Bank last April filed a winding-up petition against Shanghai property developer Shimao.\n\nChinese authorities have taken various measures to boost the property market, including cutting mortgage rates and launching a scheme for state-owned enterprises to buy unsold properties.",

    "date": "2025-01-1000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Tesla has taken the unprecedented step of debuting a major model update in China as the US electric-car maker counters intense local competition with a long-awaited facelift of its Model Y.\n\nThe refreshed version of the model that outsells its S, 3 and X siblings will start at Rmb263,500 ($35,900), 5.4 per cent more than the previous version, according to prices on Tesla’s China website on Friday.\n\nThe Elon Musk-led company expects deliveries of the revamped sport utility vehicle to begin in March, pending regulatory approval from Chinese officials. The company also offered zero-interest financing for up to five years in a presales campaign until the end of February.\n\nTesla China confirmed this was the first time it had chosen the mainland Chinese market to debut a major model update, although other smaller markets including Hong Kong and Malaysia also saw the new Model Y, produced in the company’s Shanghai factory, made available on Friday.\n\nThe facelift features a sleeker headlight and tail light, a shorter zero-to 100km/h acceleration time of 4.3 seconds and a longer range of up to 719km on a single charge.\n\n“It has everything to do with the competitive landscape and maintaining appearances of innovation in China,” said Daniel Kollar, an automotive analyst at consultancy Intralink.\n\n“A new viable [car] like the [rumoured] Model 2 would probably be better. But an upgrade to an existing model is the bare minimum they should be doing for the time being.”\n\nLast week, Tesla reported its first annual vehicle sales drop in more than a decade, with analysts saying its ageing line-up was partly to blame. In October, Musk said developing a much-anticipated affordable Model 2 would be “pointless”. The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, its most popular models, are almost eight and five years old, respectively.\n\nTesla’s failure to bring out new models beyond the so-called S3XY line-up is seen as a weakness, especially in the cut-throat Chinese market. HSBC estimated about 90 new car models had been planned for release by manufacturers in China in the fourth quarter of 2024 — about one a day — and nearly 90 per cent were EVs.\n\n“This is making Tesla look stagnant in comparison,” said Intralink’s Kollar. “So Tesla really needs to show that they are advancing to stay fresh in Chinese consumers’ minds. Other major markets don’t have the same demand for new and improved products when it comes to their vehicles.”\n\nTesla delivered 36.7 per cent of its cars to consumers in China, its second-largest market, in 2024. Its share of Chinese EV sales, where pure-battery cars and plug-in hybrids are included, fell to 6.4 per cent in December from 8 per cent a year earlier, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.",

It also produces potash, a potassium compound used as fertiliser.\n\nState-backed Zijin, one of China’s biggest gold and copper miners, is well-known to international investors on the back of a wave of global acquisitions and aims to start producing lithium from a mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo next year.\n\nIts domestic and international explorations for the metal, which plays a crucial role in batteries for electric vehicles but has recently fallen sharply in price, comes as Chinese businesses continue to establish a dominant foothold across supply chains related to the fast-growing EV battery sector.\n\nCarmakers such as BYD and Nio have accelerated their international plans, with outbound investment surging last year on the back of the clean energy sector’s growing overseas presence.\n\nInvestment has extended from South America to Europe, where Chinese battery producer CATL last month said it would build a €4.1bn lithium battery factory in Spain alongside carmaker Stellantis.\n\nPrices of lithium carbonate surged in 2021 and 2022 but have since fallen to about $10,000 a tonne, close to levels prior to the boom, amid concerns around excessive capacity.\n\nAlbemarle, the world’s largest lithium producer, said in November it was not economically viable to pivot supply of lithium to the west because of low prices and high operating costs.\n\nIn a separate statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange, where it is listed, Zangge pointed to a potential “change in control”. Trading in its shares were suspended on Friday. Shares of Zijin rose 3.4 per cent in early trading.\n\nIn November, Zijin acquired a gold mine in Peru and in 2019 bought Canadian miner Continental for $1bn as part of industry consolidation. A year earlier, it bought Canadian copper miner Nevsun Resources for $1.4bn and has expanded its copper operations in Africa.\n\nAdditional reporting by Wang Xueqiao in Shanghai",

And I think that trend is likely to continue,” said Hui Shan, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs.\n\nFalling yields offer a stark contrast to volatile and rising yields in Europe and the US. For Beijing, the fall represents an ignominious start to the year after policymakers in September launched a stimulus drive designed to revive the Chinese economy’s animal spirits.\n\nBut data released on Thursday showed consumer prices remained close to flat in December, eking out growth of just 0.1 per cent on a year earlier, while factory prices declined 2.3 per cent, remaining in deflationary territory for more than two years.\n\nChina’s central bank last year unveiled policies to stimulate investment by institutions in equity markets and announced for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis that it was adopting a “moderately loose” monetary policy.\n\nOn Friday, it announced a “shortage of supply” meant it would pause its programme that has seen it purchase a net Rmb1tn of government bonds on the open market.\n\nAn important Communist party meeting on the economy in December, presided over by President Xi Jinping, emphasised consumption for the first time over other previously more important strategic priorities such as building high-tech industries.\n\nThe change of emphasis reflects concern over household sentiment weakened by a three-year property crisis that has left the economy more dependent on a manufacturing and export boom for growth. Investors worry this run of strong exports will slow abruptly after US president-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20 with promises to levy up to 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nCiti economists estimated in a research note that a 15 percentage point increase in US tariffs would reduce China’s exports by 6 per cent, knocking a percentage point off GDP growth. Growth in China was estimated to be 5 per cent last year.\n\nMore insidious than the slower growth, however, are the deflationary pressures in China’s economy, said analysts. The Citi economists noted that the final quarter of last year was expected to be the seventh in a row in which the GDP deflator, a broad measure of price changes, was negative.\n\n“This is unprecedented for China, with a similar episode only in 1998-99,” they said, pointing out that only Japan, parts of Europe and some commodity producers had experienced such an extended period of deflation.\n\nChinese regulators are aware of the parallels with Japan on deflation, said Robert Gilhooly, senior emerging markets economist at Abrdn, but “they don’t seem to act like it, and one thing that contributed to the Japan example was going small with piecemeal easing”.\n\nGoldman’s Shan said the central bank had promised to ease monetary policy this year, but just as important would be a large increase in China’s fiscal deficit at the central and local government levels.\n\nHow that deficit is spent will also be important. Channelling it directly to low-income households, for example, might have a higher “multiplier effect” than giving it to other sectors, such as to banks for recapitalisation, she said.\n\nFrederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, said another reason government bond yields were at record lows was that the economy was awash with liquidity. High household savings and low demand for corporate and individual loans have left banks flush with cash that is finding its way into bond markets.\n\n“It’s a little bit of a liquidity trap in the sense that there is money, it is available, it can be borrowed cheaply, but there’s just no demand for that,” said Neumann. “Monetary easing at the margin is becoming less and less of an effective driver of economic growth.”\n\nWithout a strong fiscal spending package, the deflationary cycle might continue, with interest rates dropping, wages and investment falling and consumers deferring purchases while they wait for prices to fall further.\n\n“Some investors have lost a little bit of patience here in the past week,” he said, referring to the rush into bonds. “It’s still likely we’re going to get more stimulus coming through. But after all the fits and starts of the past couple of years, investors really want to see concrete numbers.”\n\nSome economists warned that the slide in Chinese bond yields could have further to fall. Analysts at Standard Chartered said the 10-year yield could fall another 0.2 percentage points to 1.4 per cent by the end of 2025, especially if the market has to absorb higher net central government bond issuance for stimulus purposes.",

    "body": "China’s President Xi Jinping will send a high-level envoy to Donald Trump’s inauguration, in an unprecedented move designed to reduce friction between the countries at the start of the new US administration.\n\nBeijing told Trump’s transition team that the top official would attend instead of Xi, according to several people familiar with the talks. The envoy would also hold talks with Trump’s team, several people said.\n\nTrump extended an unusual invitation to Xi to attend his inauguration on January 20 in a sign that he intended to resume the kind of high-level engagement with the Chinese leader that he conducted during his first term in the White House.\n\nBeijing is desperate to ease friction with Washington as it braces for a possible serious escalation in trade tensions. Chinese officials struggled to meet Trump advisers in the run-up to November’s US election, raising concern in Beijing that they would be unprepared for any shift on China.\n\nSeveral people said Xi could send Han Zheng, a vice-president who sometimes stands in for him in ceremonial roles. Another option is foreign minister Wang Yi.\n\nOne person familiar with the situation said some Trump advisers wanted Cai Qi, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee who wields much more power than Han or Wang in his capacity as Xi’s right-hand man.\n\nAnother person familiar with the views inside the transition team said there was some concern that Trump would be unhappy if the envoy was only at the level of Wang or Han given that he had invited the Chinese leader.\n\n“The Chinese need to send the appropriate level of official to start the relationship off on the right foot,” the person said.\n\nWang would not be viewed as sufficiently high-level because he ranked below Cai and Han and was a career diplomat, said one China expert.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington did not comment. The Trump team did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe attendance of any of the officials would be unprecedented, given China has previously been represented by its ambassador in Washington.\n\n“Trump is probably deemed too unpredictable for Xi to take the domestic risk of attending in person,” said Dennis Wilder, a former top White House China adviser. “By sending a special envoy of significant stature to get meetings with Trump and his cabinet, Xi can demonstrate that he wishes to get off on the right foot with the Trump administration without risking that he could return home empty-handed or publicly embarrassed.”\n\nSeveral people said that beyond the ceremonial element, the Chinese envoy would also hold substantive discussions with the new Trump team.\n\nBeijing is bracing for turbulence with Washington, particularly after Trump named a series of China hawks to top national security positions.\n\nMike Waltz, Trump’s incoming national security adviser, and his deputy Alex Wong are both viewed as being very tough on China. Trump has also named Republican US Senator Marco Rubio, one of Congress’s most vocal China hawks, to be his secretary of state.\n\nTrump said this week that his team was already in contact with Beijing. “We’ve been talking through their representatives,” Trump said in an interview with the Hugh Hewitt radio show, when he also blamed China for the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.",

And right now it’s howling that China is sliding towards a Japanese-style deflationary spiral.\n\nThe Chinese 10-year government bond yield has steadied a little in recent days, but it has still dropped ca 42 basis points since the beginning of December, and the long term chart is pretty stark:\n\nHowever, what really hammers home the Chinese economic predicament is seeing its bond market moves in relation to what is going on in other major bond markets.\n\nThe most common comparison is with Japanese government bond yields — naturally, given fears that China is falling into something similar to Japan’s long-run deflationary miasma even as Japan finally emerges from it.\n\nBut bond yields everywhere are volatile and rising sharply, even as China’s keep slowly grinding lower and lower and lower and lower.\n\nWe didn’t include Japan on this chart as its 10-year government bond yield is still a fair bit lower than China’s, but it too is heading northwards. And Chinese 30-year bond yields are now comfortably lower than Japan’s.\n\nIt basically looks like investors (including local ones that dominate the onshore government bond market) in practice have little faith that the various measures that Beijing has announced will be enough.\n\nAs Capital Economics’ James Reilly noted earlier this week, with FT Alphaville’s emphasis in bold below:\n\nReilly predicts that the 10-year Chinese government bond yield will slip further to 1.5 per cent by the end of the year. But this seems a bit hopeful at this stage.\n\nGiven that China has now been flirting with deflation since 2023 — and the producer price index is already deeply negative) it means that yields are still comfortably positive in real terms. Barring an economic miracle they can and probably should have a lot to fall?\n\nFurther reading:— China’s Japanification (FTAV)— Chinese leverage has crept up to a new record (FTAV)— Is deflation really China’s next big export?

    "blurb": "Currency softens over weakness in world’s second-largest economy and fear of Trump tariffs",
    "date": "2025-01-0900:00:00.0",
    "body": "China is to launch its largest sale of offshore bills in a move to support the renminbi, as Wall Street boosts its bets against the currency over weakness in the world’s second-largest economy and Donald Trump’s threat of tariffs.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China on Thursday said it would sell Rmb60bn ($8.2bn) of bills in Hong Kong in January, its largest single sale since auctions began in the territory in 2018.\n\nThe bill sale will have the effect of soaking up renminbi liquidity and making it more expensive for traders to bet against the currency in markets outside China.\n\nThe renminbi has weakened past Rmb7.33 a dollar in the opening trading days of 2025, reaching its lowest level since September 2023 in a challenge to Chinese authorities, which have vowed to maintain the currency at a stable level.\n\nInvestors, however, believe the central bank will tolerate a gradual weakening of the currency. Global banks anticipate the renminbi will hit Rmb7.5 a dollar or beyond by the end of the year, a level last seen in 2007, with serious implications for global trade.\n\nIf it hits that level, China has $3.2tn in official reserves and an estimated $1tn more in unofficial support from state banks and exporters that it could deploy to protect the currency.\n\nWith the announcement of the bill sale on Thursday, “they are sending a sign that even with the tariff situation they are trying their best to protect the currency”, said Ju Wang, head of China rates and foreign exchange strategy at BNP Paribas.\n\nThe renminbi has weakened despite the PBoC keeping its currency fix — an official daily exchange rate around which renminbi traded in mainland China can deviate by 2 per cent — stable at about Rmb7.19 a dollar for the past month.\n\nOutside mainland China, the renminbi is freely traded and not subject to the trading band. China’s central bank has tried to manage depreciation in offshore markets with unofficial guidance and discreet interventions.\n\nIn one sign of the latter, the overnight rate on Tuesday to borrow offshore renminbi in Hong Kong spiked above 8 per cent, the highest level in three years, making it more expensive for investors to bet against the currency.\n\nThe central bank is able to engineer spikes in these rates by draining the market of offshore renminbi with, for example, bill issuance.\n\nStill, several investors told the Financial Times they were opting to short the renminbi offshore, believing the currency will weaken further.\n\nRecent moves in the currency “are all indicative of a trade with legs and a direction in policy where the authorities are pretty comfortable with a slow, managed weakening versus the dollar and some sense of stability versus a broader basket of currencies”, said a hedge fund manager.\n\nMost investors expect the biggest weakening to occur once the new Trump administration’s tariff policies are better known. Trump is set to be inaugurated on January 20.\n\nJPMorgan, Barclays and BNP Paribas all forecast the renminbi dropping to Rmb7.5 a dollar towards the end of 2025. Nomura forecasts it hitting Rmb7.6 by May, while Bank of America anticipates it will hit Rmb7.4 by the end of the year.\n\nSome anticipate it could weaken past Rmb7.5. “Our working assumption is that the currency falls to between Rmb8 and Rmb8.1 by the middle of [2025], conditioned on this relatively large tariff shock,” said Robert Gilhooly, senior emerging markets economist at Abrdn.\n\nCompared with the previous round of Trump tariffs in 2017, “the risks are skewed towards a bigger depreciation this time round”, he added. That “will allow a fairly sizeable [currency] adjustment to take the pressure off tariffs; this is what we saw last time round”.\n\nA cheaper renminbi would help Chinese exporters remain competitive in the face of higher tariffs in the US, but it could also leave China open to the accusation of currency manipulation, a charge levelled by the previous Trump administration.",

    "date": "2025-01-0900:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s consumer prices barely rose in December, underlining deflationary pressures that have pushed bond yields to record lows in the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nConsumer price growth was 0.1 per cent against a year earlier last month, according to official figures released on Thursday by the National Bureau of Statistics, in line with an average analyst forecast from Reuters and the slowest in nine months. The reading was lower than 0.2 per cent growth in the previous month.\n\nThe weak inflation reading came despite months of effort by policymakers to stimulate demand. China’s leaders announced in December that the country would officially adopt a “moderately loose” monetary policy for the first time in 14 years and work to “vigorously boost consumption”.\n\nThe producer price index, which measures factory gate prices, declined 2.3 per cent, slightly better than analyst estimates of a 2.4 per cent fall and a 2.5 per cent contraction in November but leaving the metric in deflationary territory for the 27th month.\n\nChina’s economy has been flirting with outright deflation as a three-year property downturn has undermined consumer demand, pushing industry into oversupply.\n\nBeijing is expected to meet its economic growth target of 5 per cent for 2024 thanks to a combination of government stimulus measures and booming exports, whose price competitiveness in overseas markets has been supercharged by deflation at home.\n\nBut analysts warn the formula is wearing thin, with incoming US president Donald Trump threatening damaging tariffs that could prompt a sharp deceleration in China’s exports growth.\n\nBeijing has announced numerous stimulus measures, including a monetary policy pivot in September that largely targeted the stock market and sought to boost household wealth through higher equity prices.\n\nChina’s state planner on Wednesday also expanded a subsidy programme to encourage consumers to trade in old appliances such as microwaves, rice cookers and dishwashers for newer models.\n\nEconomists have raised doubts that such measures will be enough to reflate the economy, forecasting consumer prices to remain virtually flat this year and factory prices to continue a more than two-year run of deflation.\n\nStandard Chartered analysts noted “downside risks” to consensus forecasts of 0.9 per cent inflation this year.\n\n“Headline CPI inflation could turn negative and stay below 0.5 per cent for most of 2025,” they wrote in a research note, adding that producer prices could decline by 2.5 per cent.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year China government bond has been hovering around record lows since the start of the year, which analysts said reflected investor expectations of a low-growth, deflationary outlook for the economy.\n\nChinese equities and yields on 10-year and 30-year sovereign bonds were flat on Thursday.\n\nIn currency markets, the renminbi was flat against the dollar at Rmb7.33 after the People’s Bank of China fixed the daily trading rate at Rmb7.19.\n\nChina’s currency is allowed to trade within 2 per cent of the daily rate set by the central bank.",

    "body": "China’s currency has weakened to a 16-month low following strong US economic data overnight and as the potential for sharp tariff increases from the incoming Trump administration fuels concern over growth prospects for the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThe onshore renminbi fell 0.1 per cent to Rmb7.33 against the dollar on Wednesday, its weakest since September 2023, in spite of the People’s Bank of China’s maintenance of a steady fixing rate ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20.\n\nChina’s currency is allowed to trade within 2 per cent of the daily rate set by the central bank, and the exchange rate is nearing the lower limit of that trading band.\n\nThe selling pressure partly reflects fears that the steep tariffs on Chinese products proposed by Trump would force the PBoC to weaken the renminbi to offset their impact on exports, which have helped the country maintain economic growth amid weak domestic consumer demand.\n\nStrong jobs and services data in the US on Tuesday also strengthened expectations the Federal Reserve would cut rates more slowly than previously expected, in contrast to China, which is easing monetary policy to battle deflationary pressures. The US dollar index has rallied 0.5 per cent since Tuesday’s data.\n\n“The market is impatient and wants a blow-up in the renminbi,” said Wee Khoon Chong, a senior markets strategist at BNY.\n\nThe PBoC has declared its determination to maintain the “basic stability” of the renminbi and not allow “overshooting” of the exchange rate in markets.\n\nBeijing, which is grappling with deepening deflationary pressures in the economy stemming from low household and investor confidence, has gradually pivoted towards more stimulus measures to boost growth. On Wednesday, it expanded a programme to subsidise consumers who trade in old appliances such as air conditioners and washing machines.\n\nBut many economists believe it is holding off on announcing more spending plans while it awaits Trump’s inauguration to get more clarity on potential tariffs. The president-elect has said he would impose tariffs as high as 60 per cent on China.\n\nThe PBoC on Wednesday announced a daily fixing rate of Rmb7.1887 against the dollar, almost unchanged from Tuesday’s fixing of Rmb7.1879. But pressure on the exchange rate mounted after the strong US economic data drove up the dollar on Tuesday.\n\nThe selling pressure on the renminbi is “essentially a reflection of the Trump trade”, said Ju Wang, head of greater China foreign exchange and rates strategy at BNP Paribas. “The market’s been doing this since the US election . . . we feel a lot has been priced in, but the market doesn’t want to give up.”\n\nWang said the PBoC appeared to be “in a wait-and-see mode”.\n\nThe PBoC “doesn’t really have any good options here”, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics. “It will have to embrace some exchange rate weakness as the least bad option. The question then becomes: where does the PBoC draw the line?”\n\nAnalysts note that although the renminbi is under selling pressure against the dollar, it has strengthened relative to other currencies. “It’s not just a China story. It’s a story of US dollar strength,” said Evans-Pritchard.\n\nThe Thai baht, Indonesian rupiah, Philippine peso, Taiwan dollar, Korean won all weakened 0.4 per cent against the dollar on Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank wants to maintain a steady exchange rate as it waits for more clarity on Trump’s trade policies, analysts said.\n\nIn Hong Kong, funding costs for the offshore renminbi have risen in recent days in a sign the PBoC is trying to defend the exchange rate against speculators.\n\nWhile the onshore renminbi cannot be traded outside the 2 per cent band set by the PBoC, no such constraint exists for the offshore renminbi.\n\nChinese equities also fell on Wednesday, with mainland China’s CSI 300 index shedding 0.2 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng benchmark declining 0.9 per cent.",

    "body": "China has expanded a programme to subsidise consumers who trade in old appliances such as air conditioners and washing machines as policymakers strive to counter weak consumption in the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThe policy initiative, which was launched last year to encourage purchases of cars and home appliances, will now also include microwaves, rice cookers, dishwashers and water purifiers as well as smartphones and tablets costing less than Rmb6,000.\n\nConsumers who trade in old goods will receive subsidies of 15-20 per cent, the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s state planner, said at a press conference on Wednesday in Beijing, where a finance ministry official said Rmb81bn ($11bn) would be allocated towards the programme in 2025.\n\nThe scheme’s expansion follows calls for Beijing to do more to support consumer spending as growth momentum has slowed and a weak property sector continues to weigh on consumer and investor confidence.\n\nThe government is “thinking about consumption and boosting consumption”, said Hui Shan, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs, who added the scheme was having a “pretty clear impact” on sale volumes.\n\n“The downside of such a policy is you are just pulling forward future demand,” she added. “If I’m going to replace my air conditioner once every 10 years, [you’re] pulling the next few years of demand into now.”\n\nThe trade-in scheme was initially launched last March with echoes of former US president Barack Obama’s “cash for clunkers” initiative, which allowed consumers to trade in old cars for new ones in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Officials said a 2024 budget of Rmb150bn, funded through special government bonds, was used up by the end of the year.\n\nThe commerce ministry said 36mn consumers used the scheme last year to buy Rmb240bn worth of home appliances, and that it drove Rmb920bn of car sales.\n\nIn addition to home appliances and automobiles, the programme also aimed to incentivise companies to upgrade industrial equipment and agricultural machinery.\n\nLast month, the National Bureau of Statistics said November retail sales were boosted by the programme, citing a 22 per cent year-on-year rise in sales of household appliances and audiovisual products such as televisions. Sales of building and decoration materials, also covered by the scheme, turned positive for the first time since April.\n\nBut overall retail sales rose just 3 per cent in November, missing expectations and reigniting concerns about the pace of consumption growth, while real estate data showed the largest year-on-year fall in new home prices since 2015 and a deepening decline in property investment.\n\nChina last September launched measures to support equities and the housing market, where sales have struggled to gain traction against the backdrop of a yearlong property slowdown. Authorities have also launched comparable “replacing old with new” schemes for housing.\n\nLast month, President Xi Jinping promised “vigorous” efforts to strengthen consumer demand this year.\n\nFrederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, said most analysts saw trade-in programmes as helpful for short-term confidence-building, but suggested China needed more policies that promoted consumption on a more sustainable basis.\n\nAdditional reporting by Wang Xueqiao in Shanghai",

The Shenzhen-listed company is expected to pick the underwriters ahead of a shareholder meeting on January 17, one of the people said, where the date and size of the offering are due to be discussed.\n\nBut the move by the Pentagon — which also added tech giant Tencent and Cosco, one of China’s largest shipping companies, to the list — threatens to change the banks’ risk-reward calculus.\n\nAlthough it does not directly introduce legal restrictions on the banks’ ability to work for the companies listed, it will force them to confront a difficult reputational question: can a bank underwrite shares for a company the US has said is linked to China’s military?\n\n“Unfortunately, client names randomly appearing on blacklists is becoming a more common feature of banking these days, and that adds risk,” said Han Shen Lin, China country director for US consultancy The Asia Group. “The most banks can do is reposition their business and client mix accordingly.”\n\nInclusion on the list “doesn’t carry the same weight as a sanction, but it’s close enough that banks [may] preemptively cut exposure to the names just to avoid negative headlines,” Lin said.\n\nIt is not clear whether the US banks will continue their involvement in the wake of the Pentagon’s move. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan declined to comment, and Morgan Stanley did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe action is the latest sign of how US-China tensions are increasingly throwing deals into uncertainty — a marked change from previous years when global banks made huge profits in Hong Kong by helping fast-growing Chinese companies list overseas, many in the US.\n\nAny move to cut ties with companies on the list could be costly for the banks. Tencent in particular has been among US institutions’ most important Chinese clients.\n\nThe tech giant’s parent company paid $524mn in investment banking fees between 2004, the year of its initial public offering, and 2023, according to figures from the London Stock Exchange Group. Morgan Stanley, BofA, Goldman and Citi were the top beneficiaries.\n\nCATL has made less use of foreign banks, with the lion’s share of its fees going to China Securities and CICC, although Goldman is the third-largest fee earner from its investment banking activities, according to the LSEG data.\n\nCATL and Tencent have said they are planning legal action to challenge being placed on the Pentagon list if talks with the US defence department fail.\n\nPony Ma, Tencent founder and chair, said the company was “neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defence industrial base”. CATL said it had “never engaged in any military-related business or activities”, and Cosco said none of the companies listed were “Chinese military companies” and that it would engage with US authorities “to clarify this matter”.\n\nThe move echoes the banks’ dilemma in 2023 when Syngenta, a Swiss agricultural chemicals company, sought to hire them for a planned $9bn initial public offering on the Shanghai exchange.\n\nBanks agonised over whether they could work on the deal because the US defence department had placed Syngenta’s owner, state-owned ChemChina, on a “Chinese military companies” list.\n\nBankers at Goldman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS and HSBC had lobbied for roles on the listing, though Syngenta eventually called off the plan.\n\nCATL has told investors that access to dollars is an important part of the rationale for its listing. It had Rmb289bn ($40bn) of cash as of March 31, but China’s strict system of capital controls means it must get government approval for overseas direct investment above a certain threshold, which can be an arduous process.\n\nPointing to CATL’s use by global carmakers might help bankers justify working on the deal, especially if they add a “major disclaimer” to documents about the listing, according to one adviser not directly involved.\n\n“I mean, their batteries are in the Ford Mustang,” said the adviser.",

    "date": "2025-01-0800:00:00.0",
    "body": "It is nearly impossible to go a day in China without touching some part of Huawei’s empire. The Chinese technology giant sells a variety of consumer electronics, from TVs and smart home systems to smartphones. Its telecommunications networks and data centres keep the population online; its autonomous driving solutions are embedded in a growing number of electric cars. It designs semiconductors, builds solar panels and even has hotels. And it also operates surveillance systems for local governments, while harnessing its vast purchasing and distribution power to pressure suppliers and competitors.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to call it “China’s most powerful company,” as Eva Dou does in her new book, House of Huawei. The Washington Post journalist and former China correspondent has written an authoritative account of a company that has become both a byword for China’s rising technological supremacy and a flashpoint in US-China relations.\n\nHuawei is a hugely ambitious company. Since its founding in 1987 in Shenzhen it has come to dominate global telecommunication networks through strategic technology bets. Along the way it has attracted increasing scrutiny from governments outside China who fear that Huawei’s network equipment enables Beijing’s spying.\n\nYet, little is known about the inner workings of this mysterious company. It was thrust into the global spotlight in 2018 following the arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada. The US sought to extradite Meng, also the daughter of Huawei’s enigmatic founder Ren Zhengfei, over her role in the company’s business in sanctioned Iran. The book narrates the drama in detail and explains why Huawei found itself at the centre of so much controversy.\n\nIt is a tale that sits at the heart of the most significant geopolitical relationship today and takes the reader a long way in understanding why Washington and Beijing are at loggerheads over the fate of a company that has done so much to bolster China’s technological ecosystem and extend its influence overseas. Washington pressured allies to stop using Huawei’s 5G equipment, which the UK initially resisted before relenting, ordering the equipment to be stripped from public networks.\n\nDonald Trump first imposed sanctions on Huawei in 2019 during his first presidency, restricting some US companies from doing business with it over national security concerns. The action turned Huawei into a martyr in China. The assault from Washington continued under President Joe Biden, who further tightened restrictions on the company. Beijing has gone to great lengths to support Huawei through its turmoil after it was cut off from critical foreign technology that it used in products. The government lavished it with subsidies, pressured customers to buy its products over imported alternatives, and spared it from any action during a tech crackdown that tamed the power of China’s other tech giants, Tencent and Alibaba.\n\nNow, Marco Rubio, Trump’s choice for secretary of state in the incoming US administration, points to another turbulent four years for Huawei. Rubio recently penned an op-ed for the Miami Herald saying Huawei’s goal is “global domination”, calling it “less a telecom company than it is a geopolitical asset of the Chinese Communist party”. Huawei insists that it is a private company and that the government does not interfere with its business or the security of its products.\n\nMeng’s arrest forced Huawei to open up to the outside world. The media-shy Ren gave interviews to foreign media as part of a charm offensive to aid his daughter’s case. Dou chronicles Ren’s life — from his childhood growing up in poverty in Guizhou, a mountainous province in south-west China, to running the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker — in a way that helps the reader understand what motivates this notoriously ruthless engineer.\n\nHuawei’s first business was importing telephone switches before building its own, cheaper versions, copying foreign designs in the process. It later benefited from a government policy to rip out foreign technology in China’s communications network. Huawei developed a reputation for generosity towards government officials and telecoms executives, paying for international travel and hosting lavish banquets at its campus. Dou portrays Ren as an expert networker, including sending birthday cakes to retired telecoms experts who had helped Huawei.\n\nThere are many unanswered questions about Huawei that are the root of its troubles with the US. What is its relationship with the Chinese Communist party? Does its technology facilitate Beijing’s spying overseas? What is Ren’s relationship with the People’s Liberation Army, where he used to be an engineer? Did Huawei’s early technological innovations in router technology come, as its critics say, off the back of rampant intellectual property theft from western rivals that it then went on to annihilate?\n\nDou does not give a definitive answer to these questions but eloquently lays out the available facts and allows readers to draw their own conclusions. She is also transparent about reporting limits in understanding this purposefully opaque company. The reader is left with the impression that political support has been instrumental to Huawei’s rise and that Beijing has a strong vested interest to see it succeed.\n\nHouse of Huawei is at its best when describing how the company won the fight to dominate global network communication systems. Chinese tech companies are renowned for their brutally long hours and dedicated work culture. But none so much as the “wolf warrior” Huawei, which dispatched workers through the Sars pandemic in 2003 to win contracts over foreign companies that pulled back their workforce during the health crisis, and defied official warnings to exit countries in turmoil during the Arab Spring, sending engineers to fix equipment broken by protesters.\n\nHuawei reflects the rise of many other Chinese companies that have ventured into sectors dominated by the west. Initially, rivals dismissed the company, saying it could not innovate. That proved to be a fatal error, as Huawei came to dominate the rollout of 5G technology and has set its eyes on ever more ambitious projects.\n\nWhile the book provides a neat account of Huawei’s growing dominance in network communications, it does not cover its newer businesses that it sees as the company’s future, including data centres, generative AI and autonomous driving. But it does give the reader a balanced and detailed account of a company that has weathered multiple existential crises and emerged more powerful than ever.\n\nFollowing Meng’s return to China in late 2021, the brief period of openness ended. It stopped courting foreign journalists and providing detailed financial breakdowns in annual reports. It did not co-operate with Dou on the book. As Huawei retreats from the limelight and reporting on this company has grown more difficult, a book describing its origins and place in Chinese corporate history is more needed than ever.\n\nHouse of Huawei: Inside the Secret World of China’s Most Powerful Company by Eva Dou Abacus £25/Portfolio $34, 448 pages\n\nEleanor Olcott is the FT’s China Technology Correspondent in Beijing\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café and follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X",

    "blurb": "Ability to keep flying over Russia helps three big state-owned carriers undercut European rivals",
    "date": "2025-01-0800:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s three biggest state-owned airlines are rapidly expanding routes and capacity to Europe as their ability to fly over Russian airspace gives them a cost advantage over regional rivals.\n\nWestern carriers have slashed direct flights to China, with Scandinavian Airlines, Lufthansa, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic all suspending some routes to the mainland in 2024, citing cost pressures from avoiding Russia.\n\nMoscow banned most European airlines from Russian airspace in 2022 in response to western sanctions imposed in the wake of President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, adding hours to flights to Asian destinations, including China, and driving up fuel bills.\n\nChinese airlines, which are unaffected by the Russian airspace ban, have rushed to fill the gap, increasing capacity and offering cheaper tickets despite persistently reporting losses.\n\n“European carriers are just not competitive,” said David Yu, an aviation industry expert at New York University Shanghai.\n\nPassenger seat capacity, measured in available seat kilometres, between China and western Europe by the three main Chinese intercontinental carriers — Air China, China Eastern and China Southern — was 18 per cent higher in October than in the same month in 2019, according to DBS equity research analyst Jason Sum.\n\nThe three airlines’ scheduled flights to the UK, Spain and Italy have risen sharply, according to aviation consultancy Ishka, up between 25 per cent and 45 per cent in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 2019.\n\nThey are also able to offer more competitive prices given the cost advantage of flying over Russia. The big three airlines’ fares are roughly 5 per cent to 35 per cent cheaper than those of European airlines for direct round-trip flights between China and western Europe, according to UBS analyst Eric Lin.\n\nEuropean airlines have complained that Chinese carriers have an unfair advantage and are establishing a stranglehold on routes between the two regions.\n\nUS airlines have successfully lobbied the US government to keep a tight cap on the number of direct round-trip flights to China to stop further inroads from the big Chinese carriers.\n\nIn a statement, Lufthansa said European airlines were “in an extremely unequal competitive position with China”, where it said carriers benefited from lower costs and greater government support, as well as the ability to overfly Russia.\n\n“The fact that Lufthansa now must remove one of its oldest routes, Frankfurt-Beijing, from its flight schedule shows how much the balance of international competition is shifting,” the airline said.\n\nWestern industry executives privately question the level of demand for the Chinese airlines’ flights, which some say could be lossmaking. Analysts say political motivation is also at work as Beijing expands its visa-free plans to bring back tourists.\n\n“The economy is coming down in China, tourism is not [fully] back yet and business is still recovering,” said one China-based aviation industry executive. “You need to increase connectivity in order to increase the flow of people to China.”\n\nBut while some western carriers have pointed to weak demand for flights out of China, UBS said international passenger demand for the big Chinese airlines was close to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLarge Chinese carriers have also boosted direct flights to the Middle East in recent months amid an expansion in business activity between Asia’s biggest economy and the Gulf region as well as a deepening of economic ties, particularly between China and Saudi Arabia.\n\nScheduled flights in the first nine months of 2024 for the big three airlines to Saudi Arabia jumped more than seven-fold compared with the same period in 2019, according to Ishka, while flights to the United Arab Emirates rose 40 per cent.\n\nThe big three carriers are important to the government in Beijing given aviation was “seen as a critical engine towards ongoing economic growth”, said Ishka’s analysts, adding that the carriers were helped by route subsidies and that state ownership meant they had significant credit facilities available.\n\nBeijing-based Air China, Shanghai’s China Eastern and Guangzhou’s China Southern came into existence in the 1980s when the state airline monopoly was broken up and the industry underwent consolidation. All three are dual listed in Hong Kong and in mainland China.\n\nWhile the Chinese airlines are taking advantage of their cost advantage over European rivals, the country’s mixed economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic means they are still losing money overall.\n\nIn stark contrast to the booming profits reported in 2023 by flagship carriers in Europe and in other Asian nations, China’s three big airlines recorded combined losses of Rmb13.3bn ($1.8bn). HSBC and DBS believe Air China and China Eastern could report losses again in 2024.\n\nAnalysts said the top Chinese carriers had taken a particular hit from slowing consumption in China as well as growing competition from low-cost carriers on domestic routes. Fares in 2024 for flights departing from Chinese airports are down more than 20 per cent from 2023 for domestic and international flights, according to aviation data provider ForwardKeys.\n\nThe big Chinese airlines’ outlook for 2025 “continues to be dim”, according to Sum at DBS, who said domestic competition would continue to exert “strong pressure” on profits per passenger while China’s economic slowdown was likely to weigh on premium travel demand.\n\nA subdued recovery in flights to the airlines’ crucial market of North America will also add to profitability pressures, according to Lin at UBS. While Canada in October lifted restrictions on flights to China, flights in early November between China and the US only reached about 30 per cent of 2019 levels, compared with more than 90 per cent for China-Europe flights, according to UBS.\n\nAdditional reporting by Haohsiang Ko in Hong Kong",

    "body": "Guangzhou FC, once China’s leading professional football club and a symbol of the country’s aspirations in the sport, has been dropped from the national league after a drawn-out saga related to the collapse of property developer China Evergrande, which bought the team in 2010.\n\nThe club — which won eight national league titles from 2011-2019, topped Asia’s Champions League twice and drew in names such as Brazil’s Robinho and Italian coach Marcello Lippi — failed to meet financial entry requirements.\n\nIn a statement that referred to Guangzhou and two other ineligible clubs — the Cangzhou Mighty Lions and the Hunan Billows — the Chinese Football Association cited wage arrears and debt issues.\n\nGuangzhou’s ineligibility is the latest blow to Chinese football, which President Xi Jinping sought to develop when he came to power in 2012. In recent years, the sport has grappled with corruption scandals and financial issues at the companies backing the teams.\n\nGuangzhou FC, formerly named Guangzhou Evergrande, on Monday blamed its “historical debt burden” and the “insufficient funds” to address it. “To all those who cared about and supported the club, we express our sincere apologies,” it said in a statement.\n\nAfter its purchase by property developer Evergrande in 2010, the club embarked on a spending spree that included a host of big-name signings, echoing the boom years of China’s vast and heavily indebted real estate sector. A host of other top developers also owned teams named after them.\n\nBut the failure of its majority owner in late 2021 derailed the club’s plans for a new Rmb12bn ($1.6bn) stadium in southern China’s Guangzhou, mooted to be one of the largest in the world, and relegated the club to the Chinese league’s second tier.\n\nIn early 2021, the club removed Evergrande from its name under a new rule prohibiting company names to be used in football teams. In its most recent annual report, for the year 2022, Evergrande did not mention the club except to state it had returned land use rights for the stadium to Guangzhou authorities.\n\nEvergrande, with more than $300bn of liabilities as of 2022, frantically sought to dispose of non-core assets following its default on international debts in late 2021. Chinese authorities have focused on getting the company to complete unfinished housing projects.\n\nThe football club was a big focus for Evergrande founder Hui Ka Yan, formerly China’s richest man, who is under investigation in the wake of his company’s collapse.\n\nEvergrande invested Rmb1.9bn to build Evergrande Football School, one of the world’s biggest residential football academies, with the help of coaches from Real Madrid in 2012, state media reported at the time.\n\nGuangzhou FC’s struggles follow the dissolution of Jiangsu FC in 2021 by its owner Suning Appliance Group, also owing to financial issues. Suning, which until last May controlled Inter Milan, was hit by an investment in an Evergrande subsidiary that failed to list.\n\nCorruption issues also plague the country’s football league. Last September, the Chinese Football Association banned 43 people for life after an investigation uncovered match-fixing.\n\nAdditional reporting by Wang Xueqiao in Shanghai",

    "date": "2025-01-0700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The inclusion of Chinese companies on US blacklists is hardly new. But in recent years, the growing dominance of Chinese firms in sectors such as electric vehicle batteries and shipbuilding has attracted both significant foreign investment and attention that makes them particularly susceptible to US regulatory actions.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Defense Department added CATL, the world’s largest EV battery maker, and Tencent, the largest game maker, to a blacklist for alleged links to the Chinese military. Shares in both dropped in response — in the case of Tencent more than 7 per cent in Hong Kong, highlighting investors’ sensitivity to rising geopolitical tensions and regulatory risks. But the sell-off should be shortlived.\n\nOther companies on the Chinese military blacklist include chipmaker Changxin Memory Technologies and China’s largest shipping company Cosco Shipping Holdings, plus two local shipbuilders. Tencent and CATL have denied military ties and called the designation a mistake.\n\nInvestors’ concerns about the potential impact of the latest blacklisting are understandable given the global market share and investor base of the affected companies. Chinese shipbuilders, for example, accounted for nearly three-quarters of all global new orders last year.\n\nBut not all blacklists are equal. There are certain types of blacklists that can cause much financial damage to affected companies. For example, the entity list maintained by the Department of Commerce — which restricts US exports of goods and technology to listed entities without a licence — is one. An investment ban on certain Chinese companies is another, as this gives US investors a deadline to divest, resulting in a lasting sell-off.\n\nBut being placed on the Chinese military blacklist is a designation that carries no specific penalties and does not involve immediate bans for companies. For Tencent, which gets most of its revenue outside of the US, the financial impact should be limited. While CATL supplies US companies including Tesla, analysts estimate that US revenue constitutes less than a tenth of the group total for both companies.\n\nThere is also a precedent for challenging such designations. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi successfully contested its inclusion on the US Department of Defense’s military blacklist in 2021 through a lawsuit. Within months it reached an agreement with the US government to be removed. Shares of Xiaomi rose about 30 per cent in the months following.\n\nTuesday’s market reaction serves as a reminder of the inherent risks posed by escalating geopolitical rivalry between China and the US. But the material impact on the affected companies should be minimal.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com",

    "body": "Tencent and CATL are planning legal action to challenge being placed on a Pentagon list as “Chinese military companies”, if talks with the US defence department fail to get their new designations dropped.\n\nThe social media and gaming giant and the world’s largest electric vehicle battery maker both announced on Tuesday they would contest their inclusion on an annually updated list of companies determined to have links with China’s military machine.\n\nPony Ma, Tencent founder and chair, said in a statement that the company would “engage in discussions with the US Department of Defense” to be removed from Monday’s list, adding that “if necessary, [Tencent] will undertake legal proceedings”.\n\nHe said Tencent was “neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defence industrial base”.\n\nCATL said in a statement it had “never engaged in any military-related business or activities”, the move was a “mistake” and was “expected to have no substantially adverse impact on our business”.\n\nIt also said it would “proactively engage” with the defence department “to address the false designation, including legal action if necessary, to protect the interests of our company and shareholders as a whole”.\n\nAnalysts said there was a strong precedent for Chinese consumer tech companies being removed from the list if they could prove wrongful designation.\n\nIn 2021, consumer electronics group Xiaomi successfully removed itself from the Pentagon list when a federal court determined there was insufficient evidence for the designation.\n\n“We believe [Tencent] has a good chance to secure exclusion through US courts,” wrote Ivan Su, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, in a note to clients. On Monday, the Department of Defense also removed artificial intelligence group Megvii from the list.\n\nTencent’s announcement comes after investors dumped shares in the country’s largest company by market capitalisation, with shares falling by 7 per cent in Hong Kong on Tuesday.\n\nThe Pentagon listing will not have any immediate impact on Tencent’s business, but could presage tougher action from the incoming Trump administration.\n\nA trade lawyer in Hong Kong who represents Chinese tech clients said the US move against Tencent marked an “escalation” in the US-China tech war “given that it is such a widely known company and one that is not clearly associated with the Chinese military”.\n\nThey added that the move “raises the risk that the companies could be added to other more biting lists, such as the Entity List, which would bar them from procuring certain US technology”.\n\nTencent has nearly 1.4bn monthly active users for the domestic and international versions of WeChat, the dominant messaging platform in China that also acts as a portal for users to read the news, book travel and play online games.\n\nThe first Trump administration tried to ban WeChat from operating in the US in 2020, arguing that the app provided a channel for the Chinese government to access information about Americans, to surveil Chinese citizens living overseas and carry out misinformation campaigns. A federal judge issued an injunction against Trump’s executive order, saying it violated the constitution.\n\nCosco, one of China’s largest shipping companies, chip manufacturer ChangXin Memory Technologies, drone maker Autel Robotics and IT equipment maker Quectel Wireless Solutions were also among fresh names on the Pentagon’s list.",

    "body": "Of all the relationships Donald Trump will have to manage as US president, none may be more consequential than that with Xi Jinping. As prep, the next occupant of the White House could do worse than read two incisive new books on the man who wants to make China great again.\n\nDuring his election campaign, Trump — who is set to be inaugurated on January 20 — had a fair amount to say about Xi. He boasted that Xi respects him because “I’m fucking crazy”. After he was shot at an election rally in July, he said that Xi “wrote me a beautiful note”. On a separate occasion, he called Xi “fierce” and “very smart”.\n\nThere is, however, a lot more to be learned about Xi, the only world leader whose power could be said to rival that of the US president. The impression that emerges from these two deeply researched books is of a surprisingly complex, multi-layered personality. Xi is a strongman who nevertheless suffered deep childhood trauma. He is a pragmatist who yet retains respect for ideology. Both he and his father were cruelly persecuted by communist authorities but he remains a party loyalist.\n\nThe early part of The Red Emperor by Michael Sheridan has even a reader unschooled in psychoanalysis wondering about the sort of life-long imprint that trauma can inflict. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), a teenage Xi went through more than a dozen “struggle sessions”, which were violent public humiliations of people held to be “class enemies”. At some points he was also incarcerated, hungry and infested with fleas.\n\n“One night a desperate Xi [escaped],” Sheridan writes. “He ran through the rainswept alleys of Beijing to his home. He banged on the door, hoping to get food and dry clothes. But his mother was so terrified for her own safety — and that of Jinping’s siblings — that she not only turned him away but reported his flight to the authorities.”\n\nHis mother did not act out of callousness, Sheridan explains. “These were the actions of an insider. Knowing that her house was watched, she also knew that punishment for helping her son would be certain. He fled into the rain, crying.”\n\nThis episode is one of several ordeals recounted in Sheridan’s excellent work, the most vivid and compelling biography of Xi published to date. A veteran journalist with extensive experience in Hong Kong and China, Sheridan acknowledges his debt to Howard Zhang, a former head of the BBC News Chinese Service, who acted as lead researcher on Chinese sources for the book.\n\nWhile Sheridan’s book recounts the seminal chapters in Xi’s life and career, Kevin Rudd traces the transformation in China’s ideological worldview since he came to power in 2012. These shifts have turned much of Chinese politics, economics and foreign policy on its head, says Rudd in On Xi Jinping.\n\nIn a nutshell, Xi’s ideological beliefs could be described as “Marxist Nationalism”, argues Rudd, a former Australian prime minister, the current Australian ambassador to the US and a long-standing China expert.\n\nIn detail this means three big things. Xi has taken Chinese politics to the “Leninist left” by stressing centralisation in decision making. He has taken economics to the “Marxist left”, emphasising the role of state-owned enterprises and regulation. Lastly, foreign policy under Xi has moved to the “nationalist right”, making Beijing more confrontational and assertive.\n\nBut what experiences have moulded Xi’s cast of mind? Sheridan devotes attention to his father, Xi Zhongxun. The elder Xi had been an associate of Chairman Mao Zedong and rose to the rank of vice-premier before he was purged in 1962. He was jailed, forced to perform self-criticism and assigned work in a tractor factory. All told, he spent 16 years in the political wilderness.\n\nFollowing his father’s ostracism, Xi found himself banished to an impoverished village in the countryside for seven years of hard labour alongside peasant farmers.\n\nThis meant that by the time he reached the age of 21, Xi had known great privilege as the “princeling” son of a senior official. He had also tasted public humiliation, persecution and years of poverty in rural exile, estranged from parental love. When his father finally won political rehabilitation in 1978, Xi was re-embraced by the party that had shunned him.\n\nSheridan wisely avoids the diagnoses of cod psychology. But the rest of The Red Emperor leaves no doubt that Xi is a leader obsessed by both the capricious nature of power and the insurance it affords those who control it.\n\nThe most dramatic chapter concerns Xi’s purge in 2014 of Zhou Yongkang, the highest ranking official to be brought down by a corruption case since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949. As the man in charge of China’s sprawling security agency, Zhou was a member of the politburo, the pinnacle of Chinese power.\n\nAfter his downfall, an official newspaper described Zhou, at the age of 71, as a “crazy erotomaniac” with a string of mistresses who once had sex in an underground parking lot with an “exceptionally beautiful” TV presenter. But such prurience deflected from more systemic questions: how could the Chinese Communist party harbour a man at its highest echelon who was so grotesquely corrupt?\n\nWhen Zhou was sentenced to life in prison, details of his affairs emerged. Assets worth more than $10bn were seized from his estate, including 300 apartments and houses, 60 cars, hoards of gold, vintage alcohol, silver, jewellery, antiques, paintings and wads of cash in foreign currency. Zhou’s case stunned China and showed that Xi was not a leader to be underestimated.\n\nRudd’s book adds a wealth of context to what animates Xi’s grim determination. The former Australian PM is one of the few westerners to have met him on a number of occasions. A fluent Chinese speaker who worked at Australia’s embassy in Beijing, Rudd completed a DPhil on Xi Jinping’s ideological worldview in 2022 at the University of Oxford.\n\nAccording to his analysis, one of Xi’s formative experiences was the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, a historical moment that resounded through the corridors of power in Beijing as a tragedy (a view incidentally shared by Vladimir Putin). To Xi’s mind, the reasons why China’s huge communist neighbour foundered had a lot to do with lapses in the respect it accorded Marxist ideology.\n\n“An important reason was that the struggle in the field of ideology was extremely intense, completely negating the history of the Soviet Union, negating the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, negating Lenin, negating Stalin, creating historical nihilism and confused thinking,” according to official Chinese documents attributed to Xi.\n\n“This is a cautionary tale!” Xi adds.\n\nThus, a mini vogue among Sinologists in recent years to characterise Xi as a transactional pragmatist with few (if any) ideological convictions is erroneous, Rudd’s book makes clear. This should be a useful insight for the new US administration to bear in mind.\n\n“Marxist nationalism”, as Rudd styles it, is set to be the animating philosophy of Xi’s remaining time in office. But what is this likely to mean, in practical terms?\n\nThe answer is that Xi sees himself as on a historical mission to create a “new era” of Chinese pre-eminence. He will use his all-powerful Leninist party to reinforce his purpose. If he encounters resistance at home or abroad, “relentless struggle” will be deployed to overcome it. Trump’s new team has been warned.\n\nOn Xi Jinping: How Xi’s Marxist Nationalism Is Shaping China and the World by Kevin Rudd, OUP £26.99/ $34.99, 624 pages\n\nThe Red Emperor: Xi Jinping and His New China by Michael Sheridan, Headline Press £25, 368 pages\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning",

    "date": "2025-01-0700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Tech group Tencent and the world’s dominant battery maker CATL are among a swath of Chinese companies that have been designated by the Pentagon as having alleged military links, in a move that sent the industry giants’ shares tumbling.\n\nTencent’s US-listed shares closed down 7.8 per cent following the news and were down the same amount in Hong Kong trading on Tuesday. The company is China’s largest by market capitalisation.\n\nShares in CATL fell as much as 6 per cent in Shenzhen, their biggest decline in about three months. CATL is an important supplier to US carmaker Tesla and has a global EV battery market share of about 38 per cent.\n\nThe list is part of Washington’s broad efforts to counteract the rise of China as a military superpower. The Pentagon cannot contract with companies on the list from June 2026, and from 2027 will not be able to procure goods or services that include those companies in their supply chains.\n\nThe US defence department has described the list as a way to highlight and counter what it calls China’s “military-civil fusion strategy”, which bolsters the Chinese military’s modernisation efforts by ensuring it can acquire advanced technology from Chinese companies, universities and research programmes that are masked as civilian entities.\n\nThe US has imposed multiple rounds of sweeping export controls designed to curtail China’s ability to make an advanced semiconductor industry and make it more difficult for Beijing to develop artificial intelligence for military use.\n\nIn retaliation, Beijing has been tightening its own export controls. Last month it banned shipments to the US of certain minerals and metals used in semiconductor manufacturing and military hardware.\n\nChina’s foreign affairs ministry said on Tuesday that Beijing had “always firmly opposed the US’s generalisation of the concept of national security, the establishment of discriminatory lists of various names, [and] the unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies”. It warned China would “resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and safeguard its legitimate right to development”.\n\nBeing added to the Pentagon’s Chinese military companies blacklist has no direct legal ramifications and does not result in sanctions. However, it does carry reputational risks.\n\nTencent’s addition to the list “is clearly a mistake”, a company spokesperson said.\n\n“We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding,” the spokesperson added.\n\nCATL, which has been working with Tesla and Ford to license its battery manufacturing technology for factories in the US, also called its inclusion on the list “a mistake”.\n\n“CATL is not engaged in any military related activities,” the company said. “We welcome responsible discourse on our business operations and take questions about our business seriously.”\n\nChip manufacturer ChangXin Memory Technologies, drone maker Autel Robotics and IT equipment maker Quectel Wireless Solutions were also added to the list.\n\nCosco, one of China’s largest shipping companies, joined the list for the first time. Several of the group’s ferries, along with those of other commercial companies, have participated in People’s Liberation Army exercises to practise an amphibious invasion of Taiwan, according to ship tracking data and appearances in Chinese state media reports.\n\nBeijing in recent years has been requiring civilian shipping companies to build their new vessels to military-capable standards. The use of civilian ships is a key part of the PLA’s strategy because it lacks sufficient capacity of its own to transport troops and armoured vehicles across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nAdditional reporting by Joe Leahy in Beijing and Kathrin Hille in Taipei",

    "date": "2025-01-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s regulators sought to reassure markets on Monday as equities and the renminbi extended losses in a rocky start to the year, following weak economic data and geopolitical uncertainty ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration.\n\nMainland China’s benchmark CSI 300 index edged down 0.2 per cent on Monday and has declined 4.1 per cent in the first three trading days of the year, marking the worst start to 2025 among major Asian indices.\n\nSmall-cap stocks on the CSI 2000 have fallen 6.6 per cent since the start of the year. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index shed 0.4 per cent on Monday and is down 1.2 per cent so far this year.\n\nThe declines came as China’s stock exchanges held meetings with international investors and the central bank reaffirmed its determination to keep the currency stable, with Trump’s threat of dramatically increased tariffs on Chinese exports looming.\n\n“At the moment everyone is wondering what Trump 2.0 will bring,” said Jason Lui, head of Asia-Pacific equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas. “It’s reasonable for investors to try and take some profit.”\n\nChina’s currency slid to a 15-month low of Rmb7.33 to the dollar on Monday, despite the People’s Bank of China holding steady its daily trading band for onshore renminbi. Selling pressure on China’s currency tends to be correlated with downward pressure on Chinese equities, said analysts.\n\nWeak manufacturing data, a two-year high for the dollar index and Trump’s impending return all contributed to outflow pressure on Chinese stocks, said Kevin Liu, strategist with CICC.\n\nThe Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges sought to reassure investors that China’s economy was supported by “solid fundamentals and resilience” during a weekend meeting with foreign institutions “to solicit opinions and suggestions” on recent moves in Chinese equities, they said on Sunday.\n\nThe central bank on Monday kept the daily fixing rate — the midpoint around which the renminbi is allowed to trade 2 per cent in either direction against the dollar — at Rmb7.19, in spite of selling pressure on the currency.\n\nIts newspaper, the Financial News, said the central bank would “resolutely guard against the risk of exchange rate overshooting and maintain the basic stability” of the renminbi.\n\nIt added that the central bank’s past “experience of multiple rounds of appreciation and depreciation” showed it had “sufficient” tools to keep the exchange rate “basically stable”.\n\nIn another sign of weak sentiment, investors continued to purchase long-dated sovereign debt, as concerns over weak domestic consumption bolstered bets that the PBoC would further ease monetary policy.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Chinese government bonds fell 0.015 percentage points to 1.61 per cent on Monday, after hitting its all-time low below 1.6 per cent last Thursday. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\n\nThe weaker opening to the year comes despite announcements from Beijing that it wants to boost domestic consumption following a prolonged property crisis.\n\nChina’s rubber-stamp parliament is set to meet in March to unveil its economic policy agenda for what is expected to be a difficult year.\n\n“In terms of key things to look for in 2025 . . . we think investors need to see more regarding consumption,” said Winnie Wu, chief China equity strategist at Bank of America, adding that government support for the private sector and youth employment would be essential.\n\nDespite the rough start to 2025, analysts noted that Chinese equities had a strong 2024 after a protracted slump, with the CSI 300 ending the year up 14.7 per cent.\n\n“We do think the worst of derating is over,” said Wu.",

    "event_name": "Ruchir Sharma: top 10 trends for 2025 ",
    "blurb": "Projections about the coming year assume market shifts will be dictated by Donald Trump. But the global economy is unlikely to revolve around the US",
    "date": "2025-01-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "The world is an increasingly fragmented and complex place, but everyone I meet appears to be obsessed with just one person: Donald Trump. All projections about the coming year assume Trump will dictate global economic and market trends.\n\nA single factor is never a solid foundation for forecasting. The world is not unipolar and does not revolve around one personality, not even one as big as Trump’s. Historically, the impact of US presidents on markets has often been surprising, and at times minimal.\n\nInvestors were braced for a negative shock when Trump came to power in 2017, but that year turned out to be one of the least volatile for US stocks ever. Trump constantly threatened to undermine China with tariffs and yet, during his first term, the best-performing major market in the world was China, outpacing even the US.\n\nIf past is prelude, Trump 2.0 will not play out as most investors expect. Ironically, continuing faith in “American exceptionalism” assumes that under Trump the world will see more of the same trends it saw under Joe Biden: US dominance of the global economy and markets, led by its big-cap tech businesses. But those trends are already very extended and vulnerable to forces larger than the US president-elect. For a variety of reasons, competitive churn could return to global markets in 2025 and lead to seismic shifts.\n\nHistory shows that the global economy and markets move in cycles, not straight trend lines. Contrarian investing is rooted in these patterns. The hot investment theme of one decade typically gets overcrowded, sowing the seeds of its own demise, and does not stay hot the next. But here we are halfway through the 2020s, and the hot bet of the 2010s — big US tech — is still paying off.\n\nIn the past, the list of global top 10 companies by market cap has changed dramatically with each new decade. Now seven of the 10 are holdovers from the 2010s, including Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. The trends of the past 15 years are stretched thin amid the growing manias for America and AI, which are supercharged by excessive US stimulus, the gamification of investing and the rise of algorithmic trading and passive money managers.\n\nCreative destruction has been a defining and indeed necessary feature of capitalism since its roots in the 18th century; either it’s dead, or dormant and poised for a comeback. My bet is on the comeback. That would herald a (belated) return for contrarian investing, starting with a shift away from the US and its top tech companies.\n\nMomentum traders are the polar opposite of contrarians, believing that winners and losers of recent months will continue on the same paths in coming months. Last year was a great one for this class: momentum mania swept beyond big US tech to lift stocks in the financial and other sectors as well.\n\nA turning point looms. Since the 1950s, according to Empirical Research Partners, stocks that lead the market for nine months outperform over the next 12 months by 3 per cent on average. Rarely have they outperformed by more than 20 per cent, as they did in 2024. And after a run that strong, momentum stocks underperform by nearly 10 per cent over the next 12 months on average.\n\nMomentum runs tend to reinforce the assumption that good times will roll, pulling in retail investors in the late stages. That’s happening now. American consumers have not been more bullish on US stocks since surveys began tracking this sentiment. Momentum investing looks poised to crash in a way that could hit many investors hard.\n\nUnder Trump, cuts in taxes and regulations will send the US economy and market to new heights, or so the conventional wisdom goes. Though the pandemic is over, and jobs have recovered, the US deficit is still strikingly high at around 6 per cent of GDP. In fact, adjusted for the low unemployment rate, the US deficit is five times the previous record high for a post-second world war recovery. And Trump’s agenda threatens to push it from extreme to even more so.\n\nThe bulls wave off warnings that fiscal recklessness will trigger a crisis, since no obvious calamity has come despite decades of similar warnings. They overlook the fact that, compared with other developed nations, America’s government debt has increased more than two times faster as a share of GDP in this decade and its interest payments on that debt are now three times higher.\n\nGiven the amount of new longer-dated US Treasury bonds set to hit the markets in the coming months, 2025 could see the moment when bond vigilantes take notice. In recent years, traders have punished profligate governments from Brazil to the UK and — albeit less aggressively — France. Many observers assume that the US, as the premier economic power, is invulnerable to such attacks, but its increasingly precarious finances could shatter that assumption soon.\n\nBuzz about “American exceptionalism” overlooks the artificial boost the US is getting from state support. Following the pandemic, government spending rose sharply as a share of GDP. More than 20 per cent of new US jobs are now created by government, up from 1 per cent in the 2010s. Public transfers including Social Security account for more than a quarter of residents’ income in more than 50 per cent of US counties — up from just 10 per cent in 2000.\n\nThe overstimulated US economy is growing at a pace near 3 per cent, but the fiscal stimulus is set to diminish in 2025 and so is the pace of monetary easing. If the new administration tries to further stimulate the economy, an already elevated inflation rate could surge, forcing the Fed and the bond market to raise interest rates.\n\nIn turn, bond market pressure would finally compel spending restraint, hurting economic growth and corporate profits, at least for a while. Interestingly, expectations for US growth are now so bullish, economists see only a 20 per cent probability of recession, down from near 70 per cent a year ago. While there is no visible catalyst for a recession, fading stimulus effects suggest the US economy is likely to slow in 2025 to a rate closer to its long-term potential of about 2 per cent, if not lower. America will look much less exceptional then.\n\nMany countries now languish in the shadows — but that is where the next stars are usually found. Recall that a decade ago, investors dismissed much of southern Europe as hopeless, until crisis forced them to reform. The nations formerly dismissed as “Pigs” now include some of the continent’s bright spots, led by Portugal, Greece and Spain. The dark spots — Germany and France — could also find themselves unexpectedly compelled by their weak economies to change for the better.\n\nToday, global investors ignore most of the developing world. Among the large developing economies, fewer than one in two saw faster per capita GDP growth than the US in the last five years. In coming years, however, that share is expected to rise to more than four out of five, with big boosts coming from investment in plants and equipment, and resilient consumer spending.\n\nDisciplined government spending helps explain why credit rating agencies are now more sanguine on developing nations, with upgrades outnumbering downgrades by margins not seen in years, including positive turns on recent basket cases like Argentina and Turkey.\n\nFor the most part, global investors have yet to react, but locals have. Domestic equity cultures are propping up markets from Saudi Arabia to South Africa. India is already something of a unicorn — as the one global market star outside the US — but it may not be so unusual by the end of 2025.\n\nThe bear case is hard to argue against. No country with a shrinking population and a heavy burden of debt has ever been able to grow at even half Beijing’s target rate of 5 per cent. Still, any contrarian has to be curious about a market most global investors now dismiss as “uninvestable”, even though it is the world’s second largest.\n\nDiamonds can be found in this rough, for example by looking for profitable publicly traded companies with high cash flows. There are now about 250 companies in China with a market cap more than $1bn and a free cash flow yield above 10 per cent — roughly 100 more than in the US, and 60 more than in Europe. Yet sentiment is as bearish on China as it is bullish on America.\n\nCompare their leading electric car companies, BYD and Tesla. Both generate similar revenues and offer a similar return on equity, but sales volume is growing twice as fast at BYD, which is rapidly expanding its share of the global market. Yet BYD stock sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15, compared with around 120 for Tesla. Its market cap is just over $100bn, Tesla’s is more than $1.2tn. In the coming year, investors may come to see China as investable again, at least in its profitable parts.\n\nBig Tech’s supernormal profits and massive cash flows have been a significant draw for investors. But that advantage is shrinking fast. Taken together, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta and Tesla are on pace to invest nearly $280bn in artificial intelligence this year, up from $80bn five years ago. The race to dominate AI is on, and as a result, free cash flow growth for the biggest tech companies recently turned negative.\n\nAI mania may be getting ahead of itself. Fewer than one in 20 workers say they use AI daily. Fewer than one in 10 US companies have incorporated AI into their operations. That does not mean they won’t, just that it is far from clear how this technology will be applied — much less how strictly it will be regulated or which mega firms will make money on it. Remember, few if any established firms emerged as big winners of the internet or shale oil revolutions.\n\nThough it is tough to imagine what could derail Big Tech firms, one answer is overspending on data centres and other AI infrastructure. One of the biggest capital spending booms that America has seen since the second world war may be great for the consumer, but could be the straw that finally breaks the supernormal profits of Big Tech companies and inspires investors to question their lofty valuations.\n\nIf Trump’s tariff threats are a negotiating tactic, as his aides say, they are already working to bring other countries to the table — but without the US. After 25 years of talks, last month representatives of 31 nations agreed on plans for the world’s largest trade union, linking the EU with the Mercosur group in Latin America. If ratified, it would cut tariffs by 90 per cent among member states, which account for 25 per cent of global GDP.\n\nSpooked by America’s use of sanctions to cut off rivals from the dollar-based international finance system, many countries are making deals to promote trade with regional neighbours, or without the dollar. India has agreements with 22 countries to conduct trade in rupees; 90 per cent of India-Russia trade is transacted in local currencies. Petro states including Saudi Arabia have cut deals to sell their oil in currencies other than the dollar as well.\n\nIn recent years global trade has shifted, and today its biggest channels are within the developing world. Eight of the 10 fastest-growing trade corridors do not include the US, but many of them do have one terminus in China. The more the US threatens tariffs and weaponises the dollar, the harder its erstwhile partners will work to promote trade without America.\n\nAs a haven for investors fleeing from regulators, the booming private markets for equity and credit are no longer just a niche alternative. Since 2000, the number of public US companies has fallen by nearly half to about 4,000, while the number of private ones nearly quintupled to about 10,000.\n\nPrivate markets are becoming the first choice for companies trying to raise money. Private lending is growing at twice the pace of bank lending. The volume of capital raised in private markets recently surpassed the volume in public markets worldwide.\n\nMeanwhile, the often-opaque risks are growing. The falling quality of some private credit issuers is showing up in high default rates for their leveraged loans. Others are repackaging certain products for sale in ways that “test the limits” of risk safeguards. A few big firms are considering plans to offer private credit in exchange traded funds open to daily public trading — as if the general public were equipped to weigh the risk of assets that need to report results once a quarter, if at all. The mainstreaming of private markets and the resulting excesses could come under greater scrutiny in 2025.\n\nAmericans are exceptional in another way, with an adult obesity rate that at 44 per cent is the highest in the developed world. So it is no surprise that American TV is full of ads for the relatively new class of “GLP-1” weight-loss drugs, suggesting they offer a bright and easy path to weight loss.\n\nLast month came a new study detecting a tiny dip in the US obesity rate. Its authors suggested this unexpected turn may be explained in good part by GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic, which is likely to generate even more buzz around these wildly popular weight-loss remedies.\n\nHowever, in the growing body of GLP-1 research, not all the news is so sunny. Once people stop the injections, many of the pounds come back. In suppressing appetite, these treatments can also destroy muscle, paralyse the stomach and impair vision. Rapid fat loss can leave sagging skin in embarrassingly visible places, which is why internet searches for “Ozempic butt” and “Ozempic legs” are mounting steadily.\n\nNo doubt, these drugs have some useful benefits, and contrarians are not doctors. They do, however, know that what sounds too good to be true probably is. And as a quick fix for obesity, this could turn out to be just another diet fad.",

    "blurb": "Pursuit of entrepreneurs threatens start-up ecosystem as investors target personal assets to claw back funding",
    "date": "2025-01-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chinese venture capitalists are hounding failed founders, pursuing personal assets and adding the individuals to a national debtor blacklist when they fail to pay up, in moves that are throwing the country’s start-up funding ecosystem into crisis.\n\nThe hard-nosed tactics by risk capital providers have been facilitated by clauses known as redemption rights, included in nearly all the financing deals struck during China’s boom times.\n\n“My investors verbally promised they wouldn’t enforce them, that they had never enforced them before — and in ’17 and ’18 that was true — no one was enforcing them,” said Neuroo Education founder Wang Ronghui, who now owes investors millions of dollars after her childcare chain stumbled during the pandemic.\n\nWhile they are relatively rare in US venture investing, more than 80 per cent of venture and private equity deals in China contain redemption provisions, according to Shanghai-based law firm Lifeng Partners estimates.\n\nThey typically require companies, and often their founders as well, to buy back investors’ shares plus interest if certain targets such as an initial public offering timeline, valuation goals or revenue metrics are not met.\n\n“It’s causing huge harm to the venture ecosystem because if a start-up fails, the founder is essentially facing asset seizures and spending restrictions,” said a Hangzhou-based lawyer who has represented several indebted entrepreneurs and asked not to be named. “They can never recover.”\n\nLifeng, in its recent report on redemption rights, said they had turned entrepreneurship into a “game of unlimited liability”. In 90 per cent of investor lawsuits, the firm said, founders were named as defendants alongside companies, with 10 per cent of the individuals ultimately added to China’s debtor blacklist.\n\nOnce blacklisted, it is nearly impossible for individuals to start another business. They are also blocked from a range of economic activities, such as taking planes or high-speed trains, staying in hotels or leaving China. The country lacks a personal bankruptcy law, making it extremely difficult for most to escape the debts.\n\nWith Chinese funds and VC firms now struggling to return capital to their outside investors, a growing number have turned to redemption clauses to recoup as much money as possible. Lifeng estimates that 20 per cent of all investor exits in 2021 and 2022 came from companies repurchasing their investors’ shares and that more than 10,000 VC or private equity-backed Chinese groups face redemption issues.\n\nA start-up adviser who did not wish to be named said the situation was perversely incentivising VCs to pursue portfolio companies that were doing well but lacked an immediate path to a sale or an IPO.\n\n“VCs are putting pressure on the start-ups that can pay,” he said. “It’s not venture — it’s debt.”\n\nThe number of entrepreneurs caught up by the legal actions continues to grow. They include Wang Ziru, who a decade ago grabbed attention as a brash young founder and raised tens of millions of renminbi for his tech media and review platform Zealer.\n\nBy 2021, with traffic waning, Wang left for an executive role at home appliance giant Gree. Then, on August 9 last year, a Shenzhen court imposed spending restrictions on Wang for failing to pay a Zealer investor Rmb34mn ($4.7mn). The amount that had snowballed with interest from the VC’s initial Rmb19mn equity investment, according to a lawyer briefed on the case. Wang lost his job a few days later.\n\nThe founder is contesting the judgment and said on social media he was not notified of the lawsuit and that the deal’s redemption provision was not triggered.\n\nOne of China’s most famous entrepreneurs, Luo Yonghao, turned his struggle to repay debts from his failed smartphone start-up Smartisan into a spectacle, eventually hawking enough iPhones and office chairs in online video livestreams to pay off suppliers and remove his name from the debtor blacklist in 2020.\n\nThen some of Smartisan’s investors demanded Luo pay hundreds of millions more in renminbi to buy back their shares.\n\n“Investment is not a loan,” Luo wrote on the social media platform Weibo in August last year. “When a venture capital deal fails, one must accept the outcome. Those who resort to underhanded tactics against entrepreneurs because they can’t bear the result are, without a doubt, unscrupulous capitalists.”\n\nThe cases have filled Chinese courts. Records show Xu Mingqi lost his company and all of his other identifiable assets to investors after his materials group Yeagood failed to meet a promised three-year window for an IPO.\n\nChina’s supreme court in 2021 ruled that since his wife Zheng Shaoai had also worked at Yeagood, one investor could seize communal property including the apartment held in her name.\n\nWang, the 47-year-old childcare chain founder, has even had funds in her health insurance account seized by investors. She said her problems began in 2021, when funds connected to state-backed investor Guangdong Cultural Investment Management demanded their Rmb16mn of shares be repurchased with interest because her start-up had failed to attain a Rmb500mn valuation.\n\nTheir lawsuit torpedoed a funding round needed to offset pandemic-related closures of the group’s 36 day care centres, she said. Now, Wang owes about Rmb30mn to the GCIM-affiliated funds, Rmb11mn to banks and potentially more to other investors whose redemption clauses have yet to be triggered.\n\nGCIM did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n“I built my company into an industry leader — I have ability and I have drive — but every path I try to take is a dead end,” said Wang. “An unexpected turn of events has left me permanently and utterly trapped.”",

    "body": "China is signing growing numbers of Taiwanese people up for local resident or even identity cards, in a drive to incorporate them into its society that is setting off alarm bells in Taipei.\n\nTaiwan government officials said Beijing had become “focused” on getting visiting Taiwanese to apply for Chinese resident cards, bank accounts and local mobile phone numbers — known as the “three documents” — with many then being given the local identity cards, which are reserved for citizens.\n\n“We are concerned that when more and more Taiwanese have Chinese citizenship, it will compromise our jurisdiction,” said a senior China policy official in Taipei. “If a Taiwanese with a Chinese ID was involved in an incident here, China could say they need to take care of the issue because the person is their citizen and intervene in our domestic affairs.”\n\nThe push is seen as particularly concerning as China is steadily expanding a multi-faceted pressure campaign against Taiwan. Beijing claims the island as part of its territory and threatens to take it by force if Taipei resists unification indefinitely.\n\nSimilar tactics of giving local status to citizens from neighbouring countries has long been part of Russia’s playbook. Moscow issued passports to eastern Ukrainians who moved to Russia after it helped to orchestrate conflict in the region in 2014. Russia also gave citizenship to residents of two breakaway regions of Georgia and then cited the need to protect them as a pretext for a brief 2008 war.\n\nTaiwanese officials said China’s push to give more Taiwanese local papers had not reached that level yet, but it posed a risk of the same nature.\n\nThe issue surfaced when a Taiwanese video blogger’s documentary in late December suggested hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese had Chinese identity papers. Lin Chin-cheng, a Taiwanese who heads a Chinese government-backed start-up centre for youth entrepreneurs from Taiwan in the Chinese city of Quanzhou, claims in the film that about 200,000 Taiwanese hold Chinese IDs.\n\nThat claim could not be confirmed. But government officials, tourists and businesspeople from Taiwan said visitors to China in recent months had been asked to fill in applications for the “three documents”.\n\nAt China’s centenary celebrations for the Whampoa Military Academy last year, veterans from Taiwan were signed up at special desks, participants said. The Straits Forum, an annual event which is part of the Chinese Communist party’s United Front tactics to engage Taiwanese not openly hostile to it, also featured “three documents” application desks.\n\nThree Taiwanese people who recently travelled to China on a ferry from Taiwan-controlled Kinmen said arrival procedures in Xiamen now included filling in forms that they only later understood were applications for those documents.\n\nThe resident card for Taiwanese, which is part of the “three documents”, does not amount to Chinese citizenship — Beijing presents it as a preferential measure to allow Taiwanese equal access to local services.\n\nBut Taipei fears it is becoming the entry point into citizen status. “The local ID frequently is the immediate next step, or is even directly offered instead of the resident card,” said a national security official. Taiwan officials added that local IDs were being heavily promoted as an opportunity for better conditions on loans or home sales.\n\nUnder Taiwanese law, citizens who take up a Chinese ID will have their Taiwanese household registration revoked. But Taipei struggles to effectively monitor its citizens’ actions in China as Beijing has cut off almost all official communication with the Taiwanese government, though cross-Strait travel, trade and investment built over decades continue.\n\nAccording to the government’s statistics office, 217,000 Taiwanese worked in China as of 2023 — only half of the numbers seen at the peak a decade ago, but a 22 per cent increase over the previous year.\n\nTaiwan President Lai Ching-te last week warned the public not to be lured in by the supposed short-term gain of Chinese papers.\n\n“We have an old saying in Taiwan: Free things turn out very costly. That is very true,” he told reporters after his New Year address. Lai pointed to the many Chinese people taking enormous risks to illegally migrate to other nations, arguing that taking up a Chinese ID at this time was absurd for a citizen of a democratic country and could prove “the end of your road into the world”.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "date": "2025-01-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Taiwan has asked South Korea for assistance investigating a Chinese-owned ship suspected of cutting a subsea cable off its northern coast on Friday.\n\nTaiwan telecoms operator Chunghwa Telecom and the Taiwan Coast Guard said on Saturday that the cargo vessel Shunxing39 was believed to have caused damage to a communications cable — close to the port of Keelung on Taiwan’s north coast — on the morning of January 3.\n\nIt follows incidents in which Chinese ships came under scrutiny after fibre optic cables in the Baltic Sea were severed last November and a gas pipeline and cable were damaged there in October 2023.\n\nThe latest occurrence also highlighted the vulnerability of crucial offshore communications and energy infrastructure and the difficulties in prosecuting sabotage.\n\nWhile the ship sails under Cameroon’s flag, Taiwan officials said it was owned by Jie Yang Trading Limited. The Hong Kong-registered company’s only listed director is Guo Wenjie, a mainland China citizen.\n\nChunghwa Telecom said data connections were immediately restored by rerouting data to other international subsea cables.\n\nBut Taipei is concerned that China could surreptitiously cut Taiwan’s external communications links in any potential attempt at annexing the country. Beijing claims sovereignty over the island and has threatened to seize it by force if necessary.\n\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChunghwa Telecom and Taiwan government officials told the Financial Times the damaged cable is part of the Trans-Pacific Express Cable System.\n\nThe subsea internet cable connecting Taiwan with the US west coast is owned by an international consortium. As well as Chunghwa, it includes the US operator AT&T, Japan’s NTT, Korea Telecom and Chinese operators China Telecom and China Unicom.\n\n“Since it was not possible for us to question the captain, we have asked the South Korean authorities to help with the investigation at the ship’s next port of destination,” a Taiwan Coast Guard official said. A Taiwanese national security official said the ship was due to arrive in Busan over the next few days.\n\nTaiwan’s coastguard and other government officials said tracking data from the ship’s automatic identification system signal and satellite data showed that the Shunxing39 had dragged its anchor at the location where the cable was ruptured.\n\nWhile a coastguard ship carried out an external inspection of the vessel and established radio contact with the captain, its officials could not board it due to rough weather, and it could not order its seizure for further investigation under international law because too much time had passed since the incident, officials said.\n\n“This is another case of a very worrying global trend of sabotage against subsea cables,” said a senior Taiwanese national security official. “The ships that are involved in these incidents are typically rundown vessels that have little above-the-board business. This one, too, is in very bad shape. It is similar to the ships that are part of Russia’s ‘shadow fleet.’”\n\nAccording to data from ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic, the Shunxing39 had been criss-crossing waters close to Taiwan’s north coast since December 1. The pattern suggested the cable damage was not an “innocent accident”, the official said.\n\nChinese commercial or fishing vessels have occasionally participated in some of the large military exercises Beijing regularly holds close to Taiwan. Taipei is concerned that such “greyzone” operations, below the threshold of war, will make it harder to defend against aggression that could eventually escalate to an outright attack.\n\nAdditional reporting by Chan Ho-him and Cheng Leng in Hong Kong",

    "blurb": "Lack of blockbusters, pandemic aftereffects and hard economic times blamed for 2024 slump",
    "date": "2025-01-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s box office takings fell by almost a quarter last year as a lack of blockbusters and tough economic conditions saw consumers turn to streaming services for entertainment.\n\nWhile China’s film industry surpassed North America’s in box office revenues for the first time in 2020, its recovery after the pandemic has been weaker. The world’s second-largest film market recorded total box office revenues of Rmb42.5bn ($5.8bn) in 2024, down nearly 23 per cent from Rmb54.9bn a year earlier, said the China Film Administration.\n\nThat compares with a 3 per cent year-on-year drop in the North American box office to $8.7bn in 2024, according to Comscore and Deadline.\n\n“A lack of domestic industry supply definitely hurt, but that damage was amplified by a poor economy,” said Chris Fenton, a US-China analyst and adjunct professor at the University of Southern California.\n\nOn a usually busy Christmas Eve, box office revenues in China plunged to Rmb38mn from Rmb170mn in 2023 and were the lowest in at least 13 years, according to Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan.\n\n“[We are] affected by the consumption downgrade,” said Wang, a cinema manager in Beijing. “Simply put, it’s an economic crisis.” Attendance was estimated to have dropped by up to 35 per cent in 2024 in many major Chinese cities, with a lot of theatres operating at a loss, he said.\n\nInstead of a visit to the cinema, many viewers were opting for online streaming platforms and short-form video content available on their mobile devices, according to industry analysts at Chinese entertainment data provider Beacon Professional.\n\nAnother factor was “not enough quality domestic films on the market to generate buzz and enthusiasm for people to head out”, said Ying Zhu, author of Hollywood in China: Behind the Scenes of the World’s Largest Movie Market.\n\nBut while streaming services had “certainly eaten into cinema revenue”, Zhu said China’s box office decline had “more to do with overall economic stagnation, with the high youth unemployment rate leading to shrinking pocket money for entertainment”.\n\nKenny Ng, a film scholar at Hong Kong Baptist University, said the pandemic still “had a lasting impact on consumer behaviour in China, particularly in the entertainment industry”.\n\n“The shift towards home entertainment has gained momentum, with many consumers remaining hesitant to return to crowded venues like cinemas,” he said.\n\nSun, a 27-year-old tech worker in Shanghai, said he only went to the cinema twice last year, compared with more than 10 times in previous years, with domestic streaming platforms such as Tencent Video becoming increasingly attractive.\n\n“Many theatrical releases don’t give me a strong urge to watch them in cinemas . . . [and] there weren’t many attractive movies released,” he said.\n\nChina’s top-grossing film in 2024 was the domestically produced comedy-drama YOLO, an adaptation of a Japanese film about a woman who lacks confidence and takes up boxing to change her life. YOLO took in Rmb3.4bn, according to Maoyan, lower than the more than Rmb4.5bn generated by the top movie of 2023, the Chinese comedy-mystery Full River Red.\n\nChina has been experiencing weak consumer confidence, with youth unemployment as high as 17 per cent and wage growth slowing, while growing social tensions have also concerned Chinese leaders.\n\n“The return of comedies, while helping to defuse the social tension, also attests to viewer fatigue towards big-budget propaganda films,” said Zhu, who is also a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University’s Academy of Film.\n\nThe Chinese market contributed up to 30 per cent of global revenues for Hollywood blockbusters before 2020, according to USC’s Fenton, but their appeal has faded in recent years, with many big movies seeing 10 per cent or less of their totals coming from Chinese box office receipts. Only one Hollywood production — the sci-fi action franchise Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire — made the top 10 grossing films in China last year, according to Maoyan.\n\nHollywood films have increasingly “failed to connect with local audiences”, said Zhu. China’s state news agency Xinhua in an opinion last year noted “a lack of novelty and creativity in Hollywood movies with their formulaic storylines having satiated Chinese audiences”.\n\n“Hollywood movies are losing their lustre with China’s Gen Z audiences,” said Shi Chuan, vice chair of the Shanghai Film Association, referring to Western culture’s shrinking influence on the country’s younger generation.\n\nShi cited the lukewarm reception for the latest Mission: Impossible as an example. “This is a high-quality movie but it disappointed at the box office, as [many] Chinese Gen Z moviegoers don’t know who Tom Cruise is,” said Shi.\n\nMeanwhile, declining financing, censorship and changing tastes have been blamed by film producers and industry analysts for holding back the domestic industry.\n\nThe box office would probably still continue to grow over the next few years “due to the enormous size of [China’s] population”, said Fenton. Its film industry is hoping domestic blockbusters, including the fantasy epic Creation of the Gods II: Demonic Confrontation and martial arts fare The Legend of the Condor Heroes: The Great Hero, both set to be released during the peak lunar new year season at the end of January, could revive box office sales.\n\n“As always, the quality of films is important,” said Stanley Rosen, a University of Southern California professor specialising in Chinese society, adding: “An improving economy in China would help a lot.”",

    "body": "The writer is a professor at Georgetown University and a senior adviser with The Asia Group. He served on the US National Security Council staff in 2009-2015\n\nIf Donald Trump’s China policy is defined by uncertainty and contradiction, Xi Jinping’s strategy is defined by clarity and determination. The Chinese president’s approach to the US president-elect is not a secret. Beijing has been quite clear since the election about its views and possible responses.\n\nXi plans not only to respond, but to take advantage of Trump’s moves. During Trump’s first term, Beijing scrambled to react. It is determined not to repeat that. Xi is well into his preparations and has signalled as much.\n\nMost Chinese analysts were not surprised by Trump’s election, linking his comeback to a global tide of populism and nationalism. Beijing believes it now understands Trump’s gamesmanship and can manipulate his administration. China’s confidence is based on the conclusion — accurate or not — that China in 2025 is different from 2017, and so is the US and the world.\n\nMany Chinese argue that Xi is stronger politically and the economy is more self-reliant and resilient, even amid recent challenges. Chinese analysts view the US economy as more fragile and American politics as deeply divided. Geopolitically, Beijing sees US influence as declining throughout the global south and Asia — and support for China’s vision as rising.\n\nXi has already signalled that he will treat his ties to Trump as a purely business relationship, albeit Don Corleone style. He won’t personally embrace Trump and will retaliate early and hard in order to generate leverage. Beijing in effect rejected Trump’s invitation for Xi to attend the inauguration.\n\nBut Beijing is also signalling it wants dialogue and is open to a deal to avoid new tariffs. However, the Chinese, who prefer to use back channels, are struggling to find the right one to understand what Trump “really” wants. Beijing’s baseline assumption is that Washington and its allies will remain hostile to China for the foreseeable future. Thus, Xi is open to negotiations because he wants some breathing room on the economic front, so China can marshal its forces for a long-term competition.\n\nBeijing remains concerned that Trump’s team will focus on deeper economic decoupling, regime change in China and support for Taiwan independence, all as means to contain and destabilise China. Hence Xi’s four “red lines” at a November meeting with President Joe Biden in Peru in a clear message to the incoming administration.\n\nBeijing’s planned responses to Trump fall into three baskets: retaliation, adaptation and diversification. Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.\n\nThis has already started. In late 2024, Beijing blocked the export to the US of critical minerals used for chipmaking, squeezed the supply chain for US-made drones, threatened to blacklist a high-profile US apparel company and launched an antitrust probe into Nvidia. By taking such actions, Beijing is previewing its capabilities and creating future bargaining chips.\n\nChina’s second strategy is adaptation. From autumn 2023, Beijing began a vigorous fiscal and monetary stimulus to help businesses and now consumers. This policy shift is generating some positive, though uneven, impacts. It was certainly badly needed, but its scope and nature were also developed with a possible trade war in mind.\n\nBeijing’s third strategy involves expanding its economic ties. It is debating unilateral tariff cuts on imports from non-US partners. On his Peru trip, Xi inaugurated a deep-water port that could reshape China’s trade with Latin America, a key non-US source of food, energy and minerals. In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism.\n\nMuch could go wrong. Beijing’s confidence is matched by that of the Trump team. Both sides believe they possess the upper hand, can impose more costs and withstand more pain. The stage is set for a complicated, destabilising dynamic which, at best, results in a ceasefire. And that’s only on economic issues, not on Taiwan, the South China Sea, tech competition or nuclear force modernisation. The cold war is starting to look quaint in comparison.\n\n​Letter in response to this article:\n\nChina is ill-equipped to fight a tariff war / From Mihir Torsekar, Alexandria, VA, US",

    "blurb": "The new year will bring tough challenges for investors in the energy transition",
    "date": "2025-01-0300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Happy new year. 2025 is set to be a challenging, tumultuous year for businesses and investors in the green transition — and a very busy one for journalists covering the subject. Below are five of the key questions we’ll be tracking this year. What are yours? Let us know at moralmoneyreply@ft.com. — Simon Mundy\n\nAt a time of severe political polarisation in the US, a crackdown on Chinese green tech imports is one of the few things that has bipartisan support. Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike want to reduce US economic reliance on a strategic rival and weaken China’s grip on global clean energy supply chains.\n\nPresident Joe Biden rolled out his most recent series of restrictions on Chinese products, including solar panels and electric vehicles, last month. The incoming Trump administration is almost certain to raise these barriers still higher, as part of its push to reduce the trade deficit with China.\n\nThe EU, too, has been putting new restrictions on Chinese clean energy imports, and is likely to double down on this stance under European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s more right-leaning second administration. One notable new tack is a push for Chinese companies to transfer intellectual property to European businesses, in exchange for the right to operate in the EU and benefit from its subsidy regimes.\n\nJust how far the west will go in toughening up trade rules is a crucial question. So too is how severely China’s green tech sector will be affected, and how it will respond — whether by retaliating with trade restrictions of its own, or by redoubling its efforts to grow clean tech exports to friendlier developing economies.\n\nA still more important question is how far this lurch towards green protectionism will slow down the energy transition. A recent paper published by the Carnegie Endowment warned that, given Chinese producers’ superior scale and cost-efficiency in crucial parts of the clean energy supply chain, these trade measures “could result in a deeper and abrupt decoupling that is hugely disruptive at a critical time”.\n\nInstead, it argued for a “clean energy détente” between the US and China, saying a healthier trading relationship would catalyse wider co-operation between China and the west, and accelerate global climate action. It’s a compelling vision — but one that only the most committed optimist would view as likely in 2025. (Simon Mundy)\n\nLast November’s COP29 summit in Baku concluded in disappointment for developing nation representatives who had hoped for a radical expansion of international climate finance. Rich nations’ pledge to mobilise $300bn a year by 2035 fell far short of what expert estimates had deemed necessary.\n\nStill, there is clearly growing global awareness of the need for expanded climate finance in lower-income nations. In 2025, we’ll be watching to see whether this will translate into results.\n\nOne huge question concerns the US approach under Trump, who has vowed to pull the US out of the Paris agreement and is likely to take an axe to climate-focused foreign aid. This was a factor behind other rich nations’ reluctance to make generous pledges in Baku, and much will depend on how far they’re prepared to pick up any financial slack left by Washington.\n\nThere’s also an opportunity for economies such as China and the Gulf states, which are not obliged to contribute climate finance under the Paris agreement, to build soft power by expanding the voluntary support they offer lower-income nations, notably in Africa.\n\nWith the limits of bilateral support increasingly stark, multilateral development banks — especially the World Bank Group — will be under growing pressure to show a more proactive, less risk-averse approach to catalysing private investment.\n\nThe competition among developing nation governments to attract green finance will heat up this year, whether through green bond programmes like Kenya’s or through tax and subsidy regimes that have been rolled out from Uganda to Bangladesh.\n\nIn 2024, clean energy investment reached a record $2tn, according to the International Energy Agency — yet only 15 per cent of this was spent in developing countries (excluding China), which account for two-thirds of the world’s population. This year, we’ll get a better sense of whether this imbalance can be addressed. (Simon Mundy)\n\nWith global warming super-charging floods, wildfires and other natural hazards, homeowners in exposed areas are struggling to find affordable insurance. Governments are incentivised to keep premiums low and to shoulder more of the risk — leaving them exposed to catastrophic events that could generate massive public liabilities, with ripple effects for markets.\n\nLawmakers such as US senator Sheldon Whitehouse have raised concerns that the retreat of major insurers could set off “a crash in property values” or push state insurers to seek federal bailouts.\n\nAs of December, insured losses from natural catastrophes were on track to exceed $135bn in 2024, according to Swiss Re. Two-thirds of these losses were in the US. But Europe’s insured losses from flooding, totalling $10bn, were the second-highest figure from that class of disaster that the region had ever seen. In October, devastating floods in Spain killed more than 220 people, with insured losses likely to exceed €4bn ($4.2bn), according to Morningstar estimates.\n\nYet there are signs that reinsurance prices, one factor behind rising consumer insurance costs, may be easing slightly. Over the past two years, reinsurers such as Munich Re have raised their pricing to levels that have raked in record profits. Their expanded balance sheets are now giving them scope to trim rates. The cost of property catastrophe reinsurance fell 8 per cent globally on January 1, when policies typically renew, according to Howden, the insurance broker.\n\nAccording to a recent report by risk modelling firm Verisk, last year’s losses were actually mild by the standards of the years to come. It claimed that the world should expect an annual average of $151bn in insured losses, and much worse in bad years. This year will give new insights on how climate change is altering the risks faced by the insurance sector — and on how insurers are responding. (Lee Harris)\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence was one of the biggest business stories of 2024. And AI’s voracious appetite for electricity has been one of the most significant themes in clean energy. In a landmark deal in September, Microsoft and Constellation Energy said they would reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, underscoring desperation among giant technology companies to shore up their power supplies.\n\nIn 2025, the AI challenge for electricity grids is likely to get worse.\n\nLast month, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, an industry watchdog, warned that AI power consumption could cause blackouts in the US and Canada during peak demand.\n\n“Demand growth is now higher than at any point in the last two decades,” the NERC said.\n\nMicrosoft and the other technology giants play an enormous role in determining whether or not increasing AI-related electricity demand will be fulfilled by clean energy. With Donald Trump returning to the White House this month, the federal government will not be a driving force for low-carbon power. But Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and the other tech leaders have the deep pockets to pay for it.\n\nHeading into 2025, one of the biggest questions in clean energy will be whether the large tech players will continue to spend on nuclear, solar and wind as the federal government shifts its focus towards fossil fuels. (Patrick Temple-West)\n\nSustainable investing was thrown in reverse in the US in 2024. Investor demand for environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds slowed in 2024 as Republican politicians ramped up their ESG attacks.\n\nShortly after Trump’s win in November, Republican-led states filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, accusing the three largest US index fund managers of using their holdings in coal producers to constrict supplies in pursuit of net zero carbon emissions goals.\n\nThis litigation will be closely watched in 2025 to see if it is successful and if it expands to other companies.\n\n“The anti-ESG backlash movement is trying to accomplish its goals by leveraging antitrust risk, but also the perception of risk,” Drake Morgan, a counsel at Crowell & Moring, told me. “Companies may have a hard time telling those apart because the antitrust theories these accusations involve are notoriously slippery and courts haven’t provided much clarification, at least not recently,” he said.\n\n“A few years ago, antitrust risk wasn’t as much of a focus when companies were considering their ESG policies”, Morgan said. “What we’re seeing now isn’t a course correction, so much as the evolution of risk management as enforcement priorities shift.”\n\nRepublicans have obviously set their sights on dismantling ESG and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programmes. A crucial question this year will be about terminology. Will financial companies keep pursuing sustainable finance strategies using different language — or abandon them altogether?

    "body": "The writer is fellow for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations\n\nDonald Trump wants to roll back China’s growing footprint in Latin America. He isn’t above strong-arm tactics to do it. Just see his latest demand to reassume control of the Panama Canal, which a senior Trump appointee afterwards suggested was really about pushing back against China.\n\nBut if, or rather when, the pressure does come bearing down, don’t expect all of Latin America to respond the same way. Instead, be prepared for the region to divide less along ideological lines than geographic ones — into a northern half more tightly welded to Washington and a southern half likely to drift, especially if pushed, towards Beijing.\n\nMany believe Washington needs a positive agenda to compete effectively with China: carrots, not just sticks, like expanded access to markets in the US and more abundant development financing. And they’re right.\n\nBut assume for a moment that threats remain Trump’s lingua franca — ones like the proposed 60 per cent tariffs on all goods that pass through the new Chinese-owned and operated mega-port of Chancay in Peru, or 200 per cent tariffs on Mexican-made cars, which Trump fears China could exploit as a backdoor into the US market.\n\nThreats only work when they are backed by leverage. But the US’s leverage is not evenly distributed across the region. In Mexico and much of Central America and the Caribbean, Washington still holds most of the cards. Mexico still sends 80 per cent of its exports to the US, for instance.\n\nBut head to South America, and the picture changes. China is the continent’s top trading partner, while five of the Latin American countries most indebted to China, and four of the five that have received the most Chinese FDI, are in South America.\n\nThe best evidence that South American leaders won’t necessarily be easily swayed or cajoled by Washington is Argentina’s Trump-loving president Javier Milei. Milei, who once compared China’s leaders to “murderers” and openly adores Trump, at first cancelled plans for a Chinese-built nuclear power plant and mega-port. But by October, they were “interesting business partners”, and a new natural gas export deal, a currency swap deal to boost the country’s depleted reserves and a state visit to Beijing were all in the works.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, pressure didn’t dissuade conservative presidents in Colombia and Brazil from deepening tech and trade ties to China, either. And these were South American leaders who like Trump. Now imagine the ones who don’t.\n\nSouth America’s major economies will resist picking sides. But if push comes to shove, it’s hard to see them distancing much from Beijing. If pressure backfires, and South America swings further east, there will be consequences for security dynamics in the Pacific, critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains, and more.\n\nNowhere is the risk of pressure backfiring greater than in Colombia, one of the top recipients of US assistance worldwide. The country’s leftist incumbent, Gustavo Petro, has continued the trend. He is expected to usher Colombia into Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative in 2025 and possibly join the Brics bank. With two years left and few internal constraints, Petro could turn even more sharply towards China in response to unmeasured heavy handedness, potentially costing the US its closest regional ally.\n\nTrump and his party’s leaders have spoken repeatedly about reasserting the “Monroe doctrine” — the idea that the US must keep geopolitical adversaries out of the hemisphere. But China is not like the Soviet Union, the last real target of that doctrine. The Soviets and Cuba had soft power but little economic heft. China’s presence, especially in South America, is much greater.\n\nChina is different from the USSR in another way. Laser-focused on strategic advantage, it is agnostic towards regimes, happy to work with anyone. “They do not demand anything,” Milei said of China, seemingly warmly. True. China heaped loans on Venezuela socialists, Milei’s arch-rivals, as the country collapsed.\n\nFor Latin America, the most serious risk of the current moment is that the US, in a misguided effort to compete, adopts the same attitude: oppose China fervently enough, and democracy and rule of law are no longer concerns.\n\nTrump should worry about whether his planned diplomatic hardball will work, and where it might backfire. Latin America should beware such a race to the bottom.",

    "date": "2025-01-0300:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s video game industry is scaling up to release more blockbusters in 2025 after the breakout global success of “triple-A” title Black Myth: Wukong.\n\nIn August, little-known Chinese developer Game Science achieved one of the fastest-selling debuts in gaming history with 10mn copies sold in three days of a title inspired by a classical Chinese novel about an anthropomorphic monkey with supernatural powers.\n\nThe action role-playing game has since earned $1.1bn, with nearly 25mn copies sold, according to estimates from gaming consultancy Niko Partners. About 70 per cent of sales came in China.\n\nThe game’s appeal both at home and abroad goes beyond its state of the art graphics, fun gameplay and strong character development, according to one typical fan.\n\n“Hu,” a 29-year-old former tech worker in Beijing, said: “The biggest difference is that this is an authentically Chinese game, incorporating a wealth of historical, cultural and martial arts elements far more genuine than the occasional Chinese flavour found in other games.”\n\nDevelopers have taken it up a notch to achieve that. The game is China’s first major triple-A title — an unofficial designation for games with large budgets and lengthy development cycles released for gaming PCs and consoles rather than smartphones.\n\n“Black Myth: Wukong put Chinese developers firmly on the map for triple-A premium games,” said Daniel Ahmad, Niko Partners’ research director.\n\nIndustry insiders hope this will rekindle investment in a domestic gaming sector recovering from a regulatory crackdown that began in 2021, when children were banned from playing video games for more than an hour on certain days.\n\nThe industry has been suffering globally with mass lay-offs, tepid revenue growth and spiralling development costs, particularly in the US. In China, it is still recovering from the 18-month break in gaming approvals from June 2021, which prompted investors to pull back and forced a wave of closures of smaller studios. Authorities have since resumed issuing licences.\n\n“The success of Black Myth makes developers dare to chase dreams and reach for triple-A projects,” said one gaming developer at a Shenzhen-based studio backed by Tencent. But he added he had not yet seen venture capital investment return with any vigour.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong also received an enthusiastic reception from state media. It celebrated its role in promoting a positive view of China overseas, indicating a more accommodating political view on gaming.\n\nThe state-run China Daily published an opinion piece saying it was “exhilarating to see China break the long-standing Western dominance in the high-end gaming market and Western gamers embrace traditional Chinese culture”. This contrasted with state media in 2021 accusing the industry of promoting “spiritual opium”.\n\nThe game is leading a shift in China towards larger budgets and more ambitious titles that can compete internationally, with anticipation growing about projects, including Phantom Blade Zero from Beijing-based S-Game and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers by the Chengdu-based Leenzee, due for release later this year. The Tencent-backed studio Chengdu Ophiuchus Technology and the independent developer Digisky are also working on triple-A projects.\n\n“Before this game, Chinese developers were best at making free-to-play games, especially for mobile . . . they had not conquered the triple-A premium space,” Ahmad said.\n\nChina’s largest gaming company, Tencent, is still heavily invested in mobile. Its domestic gaming revenues returned to growth in 2024, with the release of its hit smartphone game Dungeon & Fighter Mobile, after several years of waiting for regulatory approval.\n\n“DnF Mobile has been an important factor in Tencent’s strong gaming performance this year,” said Robin Zhu, internet analyst at Bernstein. Tencent’s domestic gaming revenue grew by 6 per cent in the first nine months of 2024 to Rmb106bn ($14.6bn).\n\nBeijing has also stepped up the pace of granting new gaming licences, in another sign that the government has adopted a more favourable stance. In the first 11 months of 2024, Beijing approved nearly 1,300 games, already outstripping last year’s total, according to Niko data.\n\nZhu said the strength of Tencent’s domestic gaming business showed that even though consumers were shopping less, they were still willing to spend on gaming.\n\n“People are reining in on ecommerce but putting more money on experiences and services,” he said.\n\nBut 2024 was not a strong year for all China’s gaming companies, with number-two player NetEase seeing gaming revenue fall by 4 per cent to Rmb21bn in the third quarter. Analysts blamed in part the fading popularity of Eggy Party, a multiplayer obstacle-course casual video game.\n\nAhmad said that Black Myth: Wukong’s release showed how China had learnt how to tool up for bigger games.\n\n“China’s gaming industry has gone through an industrialisation process. Before, they found it hard to compete with the likes of Activision Blizzard. But the Chinese studios have brought in foreign experts, scaled their teams, standardised tools and production processes, focusing on high- production values, popular gameplay mechanics, and deep progression systems that can help them compete globally.”\n\nWhile they were going head to head with international gaming giants, Chinese developers had a cost advantage, he said, with the country’s vast pool of talented and cheap engineers. Game Science spent $42mn developing Black Myth: Wukong, according to government reports.\n\n“If the same game were developed in the US, it would have cost at least twice if not three times as much. The costs are so much lower in China,” said Ahmad.",

    "blurb": "People’s Bank of China will start to behave more like US Fed in using one main interest rate to steer demand for credit",
    "date": "2025-01-0300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The People’s Bank of China plans to cut interest rates this year as it makes a historic shift to a more orthodox monetary policy to bring it closer into line with the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.\n\nIn comments to the Financial Times, the Chinese central bank said it was likely it would cut interest rates from the current level of 1.5 per cent “at an appropriate time” in 2025.\n\nIt added that it would prioritise “the role of interest rate adjustments” and move away from “quantitative objectives” for loan growth in what would amount to a transformation of Chinese monetary policy.\n\nMost central banks, such as the Fed, have only one policy variable, the benchmark interest rate, which they use to influence demand for credit and activity in the economy.\n\nThe PBoC by contrast not only sets a multitude of different interest rates but also gives unofficial guidance to banks on how much they should expand their loan books.\n\nWhile such guidance was its most important tool in managing the economy for decades — as loans were steered to high-growth sectors such as manufacturing, technology and property — officials within the PBoC believe reform is now urgent.\n\n“Rate reform is likely to be the true focus of the PBoC in 2025,” said Richard Xu, chief China financial analyst with Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. “China’s economic development urgently needs to shift from a mindset focused solely on expanding the market size [of banks’ loan books].”\n\nDemand for credit has collapsed due to a prolonged property market slowdown. The PBoC also fears that credit growth targets lead to indiscriminate lending without consideration for risk, which is wasteful in the long run.\n\n“Aligning with the requirements of high-quality development, these quantitative targets have been phased out in recent years,” said the central bank. “The PBoC will pay more attention to the role of interest rate control, and improve the formation and transmission of market-oriented interest rates.”\n\nAs part of the change in regime, the PBoC clarified last year that its main policy instrument would be the seven-day reverse repo rate rather than the host of interest rates it has relied on to date.\n\nA reduced emphasis on targets for credit growth could rein in the rampant overcapacity in China that has led to bad debts at home and disruption to global industries such as steel.\n\nBut the central bank has been struggling to implement its shift towards interest rates because the government wants to channel money to the high-tech and manufacturing sectors, which is easier under the old system of credit expansion.\n\nEven as it tries to make a structural change in policy, the PBoC is also under pressure to reflate China’s economy.\n\nDuring 2024, as part of the most aggressive stimulus package since the Covid-19 pandemic, the central bank cut the seven-day rate twice and a five-year rate that influences mortgage prices three times.\n\nThe moves came in the context of President Xi Jinping’s pledge to achieve economic growth of 5 per cent despite troubles in China’s property sector and trade tensions with the US.\n\nPBoC governor Pan Gongsheng and his predecessors Yi Gang and Zhou Xiaochuan have pushed for risk-based pricing of loans in recent meetings with officials from some of China’s biggest banks, according to attendees.\n\nBankers at the meetings warned of possible confusion when pricing longer-term loans since the market is accustomed to guidance from the PBoC, highlighting the challenge of moving to the new system.\n\nFor international investors, if the PBoC is successful, then Chinese monetary policy will start to resemble the system they are used to in the US, Europe or Japan.\n\nFor the first time in two decades, the central bank also bought government bonds in the open market to inject money into the financial system in 2024, in the same way that the Fed conducts its policy.\n\nAnalysts said the PBoC still lacked some essential ingredients for a system based on interest rates, such as a schedule of routine, publicly disclosed meetings to make policy decisions.\n\nWithout such guidance, “market participants might find themselves guessing what will happen next”, said Haibin Zhu, China economist at JPMorgan Chase.",

    "date": "2025-01-0200:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s best-selling car manufacturer BYD sold a record number of electric vehicles and hybrids globally last year, even as fierce competition took hold in its home market.\n\nTesla’s biggest rival sold 4.3mn EVs and hybrids in 2024, far more than the target of 3.6mn it set earlier, according to the company. “China’s champion, the world’s champion,” the company said in a social media post late on Wednesday.\n\nBYD sold 1.76mn pure EVs last year, but not enough to oust Tesla as the world’s biggest-selling EV maker. The US company, run by Elon Musk, said on Thursday that it delivered 1.79mn cars last year.\n\nLi Auto, China’s first profitable EV start-up, Stellantis-backed Leapmotor and smartphone maker Xiaomi also surpassed their targets, selling 500,000, 290,000 and 135,000 EVs respectively during 2024.\n\nChina is expected to sell more EVs, including pure battery-powered cars and plug-in hybrids, than vehicles with internal combustion engines for the first time in 2025, as a result of hundreds of billions of dollars in government subsidies over the past decade.\n\nCarmakers have also been helped by a trade-in scheme launched last April that allowed consumers to receive Rmb20,000 ($2,740) for replacing an old gas-powered car with an EV.\n\nBut while some of the bigger names performed well, intense competition and a prolonged price war have put scores of players under pressure. Dozens of companies such as Xpeng and Nio fell short of their sales targets, even as they recorded growth.\n\n“Competition in the market is very fierce,” said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. “The biggest companies are taking an increasingly large piece of the pie, while most of the smaller groups are struggling.”\n\nConsolidation is already reshaping the world’s largest EV market. Once high-flying start-ups such as HiPhi and Baidu-backed Jidu have collapsed over the past year. Auto conglomerate Geely combined its sub-brands Zeekr and Lynk & Co in November to “streamline operations”.\n\n“The economies of scale matter more than ever to carmakers as the industry transitions to EVs,” added Zhang.\n\nAnalysts also pointed out that the entrance of tech groups such as Xiaomi and Huawei had deepened competition.\n\nAs of December 31, Xiaomi sold more than 135,000 units of its only model, the SU7 sedan, launched in late March, surpassing its goal of 130,000 cars. Founder Lei Jun said on Wednesday the group aimed to more than double that in 2025 by delivering 300,000 EVs.\n\n“The country’s EV market is huge, so even a niche segment could see considerable demand,” said Li Yanwei, a member of the China Automobile Dealers Association expert committee.\n\n“Xiaomi’s SU7 sedan made a splash by capturing consumers’ demands for a personalised [car] with an attractive price tag.”\n\nPresident Xi Jinping acknowledged the success of the industry in his New Year’s address. “[China’s] annual production volume of new energy vehicles exceeded 10mn units for the first time,” Xi said in a televised speech on Tuesday.",

    "body": "Alibaba has agreed to sell its entire stake in China’s largest hypermarket operator at a steep discount, as it sharpens its focus on core ecommerce operations amid intensifying competition.\n\nThe Chinese tech group will sell its 73.7 per cent stake in Sun Art Retail to private equity firm DCP Capital at HK$1.75 per share, the company disclosed in a filing on Wednesday evening, after the shares had closed the day at $2.48.\n\nThe sale is expected to raise gross proceeds of up to $1.7bn, but will mean a loss of Rmb13.2bn ($1.8bn) for Alibaba shareholders when the deal is completed, it added.\n\nSun Art’s Hong Kong-listed shares plunged as much as 35 per cent on Thursday before narrowing losses to 17 per cent. Alibaba’s shares slipped 0.7 per cent.\n\nThe Sun Art deal came after Alibaba’s exit from Intime Retail Group in December, marking Alibaba’s second major divestment of bricks-and-mortar assets in less than a month. The department store chain was sold to a consortium including clothes retailer Youngor Group and Intime’s management team for $1bn, less than half what Alibaba had paid for it seven years earlier.\n\nThe quick sales of Sun Art — the biggest hypermarket operator by number of stores and staff — and Intime at significant discounts underscore the urgency of Alibaba’s pivot back to its ecommerce roots in a bid to sustain growth and strengthen competitiveness.\n\nOnce a dominant force in Chinese ecommerce, Alibaba is now racing to counter heightened competition from rivals such as Temu owner Pinduoduo, while retreating from unprofitable expansions into non-core businesses that have weighed on returns.\n\nAlibaba said in its filing that the sale of Sun Art represented “a good opportunity to monetise non-core assets and redeploy proceeds to focus on developing its core businesses and enhancing shareholder returns”.\n\nThe group first invested in Sun Art in 2017, with it later taking majority control in 2020 in a HK$28bn (US$3.6bn) deal with France’s Mulliez family. The move was part of its ambitious strategy begun in 2016 to create a “new retail” model blending online and offline shopping experiences.\n\nHowever, the vision of a retail empire that connects ecommerce and physical stores faltered amid the shock of the pandemic and an economic slowdown that curbed consumer spending in China.\n\nIn November, Alibaba announced plans to merge its domestic and international ecommerce operations into a single unit under chief executive Jiang Fan, a move viewed as key to Alibaba’s future strategy.\n\nAlibaba still retains smaller holdings in other traditional Chinese retailers including Suning.com. It is also restructuring the business strategy of its grocery chain Hema, or Freshippo, to increase profitability.",

    "blurb": "While Trump threatens punitive tariffs, investors need to understand how much the country has altered in recent years",
    "date": "2025-01-0200:00:00.0",
    "body": "I first visited the ancient Chinese classical gardens in the little town of Suzhou in 2002. It was a two-hour, standing room only slog by commuter train from Shanghai. When I arrived, the only people wandering among the pavilions were fellow international tourists — locals were too busy working for such frivolity.\n\nI returned recently, some 22 years after that first trip. It is unrecognisable. Suzhou is now a city of 7mn people — 25 minutes by bullet train from Shanghai. Admission to the town’s acclaimed museum is by app and tickets are sold to a growing army of Chinese tourists, normally by mid-morning.\n\nEveryone knows China has changed, but I wonder how many Western investors comprehend just how much and in what ways. And, if you want to invest successfully there, you need to understand this.\n\nChina has been a disappointment for investors since Covid. The lockdown was so much more severe there than in the west — its population was not cushioned by furlough payments. Economic recovery has been much slower and the Chinese stock market too easy to shun.\n\nTrump’s victory raises the spectre of punitive tariffs on Chinese imports into the US. He repeatedly cited a figure of 60 per cent during the election campaign and in November warned of “an additional 10 per cent tariff, above any additional tariffs” (sic).\n\nTrump’s bark may yet prove worse than his bite — as it was when he imposed tariffs on China in early 2018. His nominee as Treasury Secretary, billionaire financier Scott Bessent, has described 60 per cent as a “maximalist” position and said of the president-elect: “My general view is that at the end of the day he’s a free trader. It’s escalate to de-escalate.”\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that the US share of Chinese exports is down to 14.5 per cent today, compared with 19 per cent in 2017, so it’s not as dependent as it used to be.\n\nArguably more relevant to investors are the recent promises of Chinese government stimulus. Share prices have risen by more than 26 per cent on average in the past couple of months, but they are still cheap by many measures — and could represent an opportunity.\n\nChina’s affluent middle class is set to grow by 80mn by 2030 (equivalent to nearly a quarter of the US population as a whole). And this growth will be amplified if the Chinese can be encouraged to change some of their financial habits.\n\nOne of the big reasons for China’s economic slump was the unwillingness of its people to spend. In the west we save on average around 7 per cent of our income. In China it’s nearer 35 per cent.\n\nThere is a reason for this. Despite being a nominally communist state, China can be ruthlessly capitalist. There is no national health service and insurance and pension industries are fledgling (though rich in potential). Families need a bigger safety net.\n\nRemember too, that this is a country that has only recently become wealthy and has an ageing population. Muscle memory and the handed-down stories of grandparents who barely had enough to get by have a powerful impact on spending habits. Covid reinforced this.\n\nThe consequence is that whereas about two-thirds of GDP is typically derived from consumer spending globally, in China it is just over one-third.\n\nWhat has driven China’s economic miracle has been infrastructure spending — investment in property and modern roads and speeding trains that have drawn hundreds of millions from rural areas to the country’s fast-growing urban centres (3mn a year to Shanghai alone).\n\nThe Chinese government knows that the next phase of growth cannot come from infrastructure — it must come, at least partially, from consumption — from supporting the rise of the middle class and encouraging people to spend more. The two in tandem could be powerful drivers of growth.\n\nIf the government in Beijing succeeds, the winners will not be yesterday’s winners — for a long time the Western companies that jumped in to establish an early presence as the country’s economic revolution gathered steam. With more choice, consumers are becoming more discerning in their purchases, and we are seeing the rise of domestic brands that are often more adept at reading and catering to the consumer mood.\n\nSouth Korea’s Samsung’s recent troubles are in part because Chinese brands such as Huawei, Vivo, OPPO and Xiaomi have virtually pushed it out of the smartphone market in China.\n\nThe country’s electric car industry, with the benefits of government subsidies, has established a similar grip on the domestic market. BYD produced 1.76mn EVs in 2024, close to Tesla’s 1.79mn — but it also built another 2.49mn hybrids. In four years China has overtaken the US, South Korea, Japan and Germany to become the world’s leading car exporter. Chinese manufacturers on track to become well-known names over here — beyond BYD — include Dongfeng, SAIC (owner of the MG brand), Nio and Xpeng. It is a similar story in fashion and cosmetics: look out for Icicle and Proya.\n\nFor me, the bigger question investors should ask is not whether the Chinese will spend again, but how. As Beijing continues to take steps to address the fallout from the real estate implosion — which has undoubtedly played a big role in curbing consumer spending in recent years — new market opportunities are arising.\n\nOne area that has seen rapid growth since Covid is health and fitness. Running has become hugely popular. Beneficiaries include Adidas and the Chinese brand Anta. And then there is tourism — now back at pre-Covid levels and up 32 per cent year on year. Trip.com is already benefiting from this trend.\n\nHistorically, the safest way to play China’s growth story was to buy Western companies exposed to the Chinese market. Some may say that is still the case — but concerns remain that the state will arbitrarily undermine international businesses seen to cross a line in its eyes.\n\nNevertheless, I believe some of the best opportunities come from spotting the domestic brands that have taken root in China and are growing strongly. Investing in China is not as simple as it was, but from this low valuation point the potential rewards are arguably greater than ever, despite Trump.\n\nSwetha Ramachandran is a global equity manager at Artemis\n\nThis article has been updated since original publication to include the latest BYD and Tesla production figures",

    "date": "2025-01-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The EU, a political project conceived to remove trade barriers, has been raising tariff walls at its fastest rate in 15 years. But just as fast as the defences are built against cheap Chinese imports, fresh storms blow the bloc off balance again.\n\nDonald Trump’s threat to impose levies of up to 60 per cent on Chinese goods would, for instance, put an even higher tariff wall around the US than anything the EU has planned.\n\nThe effect, if the US president follows through, would be to divert Chinese goods from the US to the EU — forcing Brussels to in turn consider hitting back with even tougher defensive measures.\n\nIt is an impossible situation for a union that has taken pride in its free-trading instincts. Every barrier it erects can save some domestic jobs but will also reduce the competitiveness of other domestic industries by raising the price of imports.\n\nWith China now accounting for 30 per cent of global industrial output, the ripple effects will be considerable on EU products ranging from electric vehicles to Italian tomato paste.\n\nVulnerable industries, such as steel and glass fibre makers, complain the EU has not been building trade defences fast enough or high enough to save them. “We are close to a tipping point for many industries,” said Laurent Ruessmann, a partner with RB Legal and trade defence expert.\n\nOn the other hand, those who want cheap Chinese inputs to keep their own product prices down, such as paint makers, have lobbied against tariff measures. The EU has put duties on titanium dioxide, a key ingredient, leaving paint makers worried they will have to absorb the cost or lose sales.\n\nSimon Evenett, professor of geopolitics and strategy at IMD Business School, said tariffs always ended up costing consumers or other businesses.\n\n“Europe’s dilemma is either to sacrifice jobs downstream by slapping tariffs on Chinese imports or watch EU producers shrink by doing nothing. When it comes to protectionism, someone’s ox always gets gored.”\n\nHowever, Aegis Europe, which represents heavy industries such as steel and chemicals, argued that the EU was sitting on the fence.\n\nTrade defence measures cover far less of its EU imports than other trading blocs, according to Aegis. The number of tariffs has grown to their highest level since 2009, with 141 in force in 2023. But rebased against total imports, the US, Australia and Canada have more than 10 times larger protective shields.\n\n“Claims that EU manufacturers use trade defence as a protectionist tool do not stand up to scrutiny,” it said in a report.\n\nBrussels has responded. In a move asked for by Aegis, it now automatically registers imports when a trade investigation is opened. It can then backdate tariffs if it wishes, deterring stockpiling during the months-long probe to beat the price rises.\n\nBut even with tariffs in place, China has tended to find ways around them. Since the EU put anti-subsidy duties in 2010 on glass fibre — used in construction, wind turbines and other industries — Chinese producers have doubled their market share.\n\nAfter the tariffs were imposed, imports started surging from Egypt. China’s state-owned Jushi had opened a plant there, and Brussels eventually put tariffs on Egypt too.\n\nLudovic Piraux, chief executive of producer 3B and president of Glass Fibre Europe, said the tariffs were ultimately too low. “Companies operating within a market economy like ours cannot withstand the relentless attacks from Chinese state-subsidised competitors,” he said.\n\nThe steel industry is feeling the squeeze most — hobbled by weak demand, high energy costs and regulation forcing it to invest to eliminate carbon emissions.\n\nSteel production hit its lowest ever level — 128mn tonnes — in 2023, according to Eurofer, the lobby group. Trump put tariffs on the metal in his first term in an effort to protect his voters in the industrial heartland of the US, and could reactivate them within days of his return.\n\nAxel Eggert, Eurofer director-general, said: “We have to decide if we want a European steel industry or not.”\n\nCarmakers — themselves now partially protected by tariffs from a surge of cheap, allegedly subsidised Chinese electric vehicle imports — needed EU steel, Eggert argued. While they might be tempted by cheaper Chinese offerings to lower their costs, “as soon as we are gone, the Chinese will raise prices”.\n\nThe EU might be tempted to reopen talks with the US on a “green steel club”, which would allow tariff free trade between members while those outside pay.\n\nThis was once dismissed by Brussels as incompatible with World Trade Organization rules. But senior EU officials now hint that they could be flexible in interpreting the rules.\n\nIn this hostile environment, even good students of trade multilateralism may find it impossible to stick to their principles.",

    "body": "US investors in Chinese venture capital funds are racing to comply with new rules banning them from backing companies that develop artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies used by the People’s Liberation Army.\n\nMeasures by the Biden administration, which come into force on Thursday, impose civil and criminal penalties for US entities that invest in Chinese companies involved in semiconductors, quantum computing or AI systems that could be used by China’s military.\n\nThe rules introduce a hefty due diligence burden on US investors. Institutions with money tied up in Chinese investment funds must secure “binding contractual assurance” that their cash will not be used to buy companies that violate the rules.\n\nSome large investors have secured such assurances from their Chinese fund managers in recent weeks, but requests from others have been refused, according to people advising large pension and endowment funds on compliance planning.\n\nMany investors have responded by cutting back or pausing new investments in China amid growing tensions between Washington and Beijing. Silicon Valley venture firms Sequoia Capital and GGV Capital separated from their Chinese entities in 2024.\n\nThe rules come into effect at a time when US-China ties could be further strained by the return to office of president-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to increase tariffs on Chinese imports, highlighting the risks for US groups of investing in the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThey also follow a period of growing bipartisan consensus in Washington that the US has to do more to prevent China from getting ahead in key technologies, particularly militarily sensitive ones.\n\nA report by the US House of Representatives China committee in February said American venture capital firms had invested more than $3bn into technology companies that directly fuelled China’s military advancement.\n\nInvestors granted assurances will have to perform due diligence to ensure the rules are being followed by their Chinese funds. This is a particular concern since the country’s laws empower the government and private individuals to take countermeasures against “discriminatory” foreign sanctions by other states.\n\n“The problem is that US investors are signing binding contracts with some entities that may be otherwise bound to violate it,” said Phil Ludvigson, a partner at law firm King & Spalding, who advises on national security risks related to foreign investment. “It puts everyone in a tough spot.”\n\nThe new rules could also reduce investing in non-prohibited sectors in China because of the wide use of AI.\n\n“US dollar foundations are done committing to China, period,” said an executive at a large American endowment fund. “The hurdle for making new commitments on the private side is 50,000 feet high.”\n\nChina reported its smallest annual foreign direct investment since the 1990s in 2023, while foreign capital in China’s VC industry plunged 60 per cent in 2023 to $3.7bn, according to Dealogic.\n\nBy contrast, over the past decade Silicon Valley venture capitalists, wealthy family offices and public pension and endowment funds across the US — known as “limited partners” — invested billions of dollars in China’s technology sector.\n\nHongShan, Sequoia Capital’s former China business, raised nearly $9bn in 2022, with about half coming from US LPs.\n\nHillhouse, which launched in 2005 with a $20mn investment from Yale University’s endowment fund, where its founder Zhang Lei had studied, has grown into a $65bn tech investing powerhouse.\n\nOther big US investors in China include the $460bn California Public Employees’ Retirement Fund and the $260bn New York State Common Retirement Fund, both of which have between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of their portfolios invested in the country.\n\nThe 72 largest US public pension funds pumped $68bn into China between 2020 and 2023, according to a report by the Future Union think-tank.",

    "blurb": "State-owned Comac opens offices abroad and pushes for overseas certification as it increases output of C919 jets",
    "date": "2025-01-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "China is stepping up its push to break the grip of Boeing and Airbus on the aircraft market, as the state-run maker of the country’s first homegrown passenger jet seeks certifications for it to fly beyond the country’s shores.\n\nComac’s heavily subsidised C919, which made its maiden commercial flight in 2023, is already flown on domestic routes by China’s three big state-owned carriers: Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines. From this month, China Eastern will fly the C919 between Hong Kong and Shanghai, its first regular commercial route outside China’s mainland.\n\nYang Yang, the company’s deputy general manager of marketing and sales, told the Financial Times the company was aiming for the single-aisle plane to be flying in south-east Asia by 2026 and to gain European certification as early as this year.\n\n“We hope to operate more of the jets domestically in China and to thoroughly identify any issues before . . . bringing them to south-east Asia,” he said.\n\nThe C919 is a pivotal project in President Xi Jinping’s drive for China to move up the technology value chain, with the ultimate aim of challenging the western duopoly of Boeing and Airbus.\n\nBoeing’s financial woes and delivery delays, as well as wider supply chain problems in the industry that have left it and Airbus facing engine and component shortages, have weighed on the global aviation sector and offered hope for newcomers.\n\nThe world will need 42,430 new aircraft over the next two decades, roughly 80 per cent of which will be single-aisle aircraft, according to an Airbus forecast in 2024. Aviation consultancy IBA predicts that Comac can raise its output of C919s — 16 of which have been delivered to Chinese airlines as of December — from one to 11 a month by 2040, by which time it can deliver almost 2,000 units of the aircraft.\n\nHowever, Jonathan McDonald, IBA’s manager for classic and cargo aircraft, said that while Comac would eventually penetrate export markets, “for the foreseeable future Airbus and Boeing will be the main suppliers of narrow-bodies to most airlines”.\n\nGlobal certification and maintenance support remain significant hurdles to Comac’s ambition for the C919 to operate overseas.\n\nIn a move to boost its international presence, Comac opened new overseas outposts in Singapore and Hong Kong in October.\n\nThe new offices were necessary to help drive aircraft orders from customers, according to Mayur Patel, head of Asia for OAG Aviation.\n\nBut Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said building “elaborate product support facilities in export markets is very hard and expensive work, and a necessary precondition for competing with Airbus and Boeing”.\n\nWhile several carriers in Asia have expressed interest in the C919, some executives say privately that they remain hesitant.\n\n“Maintenance support is the main issue,” said a person close to Indonesia’s TransNusa, which has already received three of Comac’s smaller ARJ21 aircraft and is considering flying the C919.\n\nThe path for Comac to gain overseas certification, particularly from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, is also challenging, according to analysts.\n\n“IBA does not expect the C919 to be certified in Europe in the immediate future,” McDonald said. “Europe has very strict certification parameters.”\n\nMeanwhile, certification from the US Federal Aviation Authority is likely to be complicated by US-China tensions.\n\nEU and US regulators are often the “gold standard” for other global authorities, according to David Yu, an aviation industry expert at NYU Shanghai.\n\nIn parallel with its push with the C919, Comac is also developing its first widebody aircraft, the C929. At one of China’s largest air shows in Zhuhai in November, the company announced that state-owned Air China had become the first airline to pledge to fly the jet, which is aimed at challenging the larger planes made by Airbus and Boeing such as the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nSash Tusa, a UK-based aerospace and defence analyst, said that while the C929 offered China another opportunity to prove its technological advancement in the aerospace sector, the country would still probably be reliant on overseas engines for commercial jets. IBA estimates that the C929 will not come into service before 2040.\n\nFor the C919, key components are still western-made. The jet’s engines are supplied by Franco-American venture CFM International while its auxiliary power units are made by US-based Honeywell.\n\n“So far, [Comac is] building aircraft that are mostly western by value, but with Chinese structures,” said AeroDynamic Advisory’s Aboulafia. “That makes production ramps dependent on western willingness to continue providing systems, and, given a Trump presidency, there’s no guarantee of that at all.”\n\nComac would probably not be able to get any “fair share of the global market” within the next decade, Tusa said, but would provide an important “import substitution” for domestic Chinese airlines.\n\n“Airbus builds in China. Boeing doesn’t,” he said. “So Comac comes in as the second supplier. Import substitution doesn’t make you a competitor. That makes you an act of state policy.”\n\nAdditional reporting by William Langley in Guangzhou",

    "blurb": "President uses new year address to stress support for country’s vulnerable people and reiterate Taiwan stance ",
    "date": "2024-12-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed support for the country’s vulnerable elderly and youth in a new year address that acknowledged the strains on some of the 1.4bn-strong population.\n\nXi’s speech comes after his economic planners have for much of the past four years struggled to restore consumer confidence or address rising youth unemployment and slow wage growth.\n\nIn the televised speech on Tuesday evening the 71-year-old leader, speaking in front of a large motif of the Great Wall, said that issues of employment, income growth, elderly care, childcare, education and healthcare “are always on my mind”.\n\nXi said that a July meeting of the Chinese Communist party leadership had sounded a “clarion call for further comprehensive deepening of reform”.\n\n“Enabling people to live happy lives is the top priority,” he said. “Every household hopes that children can receive good education, the elderly can have good care services, and young people can have more development opportunities.”\n\nChina’s economy, which is the world’s second biggest behind the US, recorded growth of 4.8 per cent in the first nine months of the year, trailing Beijing’s official target of about 5 per cent.\n\nWeak sentiment and deflationary pressures follow a series of blows, from the pandemic and a years-long property market slump, to Xi’s reassertion of Communist party control over large swaths of China’s business landscape.\n\nXi on Tuesday also repeated a thinly veiled warning over international support for Taiwan. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has not ruled out using force if Taipei refuses unification indefinitely.\n\n“Compatriots on both sides of the Strait are one family. No one can sever our blood ties and kinship, and no one can stop the historical trend of national reunification,” Xi said.\n\nXi has increasingly steered state support for high-tech manufacturing and industry, lifting investment in electric vehicles, batteries, semiconductors and artificial intelligence, while pursuing China-made production of critical technologies.\n\nOn Tuesday he highlighted China’s progress in technological self-reliance and breakthroughs in areas including computer chips, AI and space exploration.\n\nA series of policy-easing measures announced by Beijing since September, including some property and stock market support, has been viewed as a sign that the Xi administration is shifting focus to stoking domestic demand.\n\nReflecting those changes, the World Bank last week revised its forecast for China’s GDP growth next year upwards by 0.4 percentage points to 4.5 per cent.\n\nHowever, China has this year been rocked by a series of mass killings and stabbings that some experts have blamed on rising social strains. Fan Weiqiu, a 62-year-old man, was last week sentenced to death after being found guilty of driving his car into a crowd in Zhuhai, southern China, in November, leaving at least 35 people dead, the country’s worst mass killing in a decade.\n\nAhead of a series of national holidays Beijing has started to urge local governments to expand the delivery of seasonal cash handouts to people facing economic hardship, including unemployed youth.\n\nKelvin Lam, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said while the handouts would not have a significant impact on the broader economy they might shore up social stability and consumption in poorer rural areas.\n\nChina’s economic outlook has been further weakened by strained relations with the US.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, the US has restricted China’s access to computer chips, clamped down on Chinese investment into the US and ramped up sanctions on Chinese companies for trading with Russia in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Xi told Russian leader Vladimir Putin that “strategic co-ordination” between China and Russia continued to reach higher levels under their leadership, according to a new year message reported by Xinhua, the state news agency.\n\nAdditional reporting by Wenjie Ding in Beijing, Cheng Leng in Hong Kong and Kathrin Hille in Taipei\n\n\n\n",

    "blurb": "Manila does not have maritime resources to go toe to toe with Beijing, say government officials",
    "date": "2024-12-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Two years of escalating confrontation in the South China Sea have persuaded the Philippines that going head-on against Beijing is not viable as it tries to police one of the world’s largest maritime territories.\n\nDirect clashes with the Chinese coastguard — accused of behaving “like Vikings” — threaten to exhaust Manila’s limited resources, according to Philippine government officials. They said the country had to balance securing its western flank, where China is most active, with the need to safeguard the rest of its maritime interests across 7,000 islands where smuggling and piracy are perennial threats.\n\n“We cannot go toe to toe with China,” said Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general in President Ferdinand Marcos Jr’s National Security Council. “We are not a rising superpower like China who has enormous resources at their disposal, so we have to live with what we have.”\n\nThe government is now employing a mix of diplomacy, drones, new laws and new naval infrastructure to try to protect its maritime rights, said government officials.\n\nThe more measured approach is part of an effort to secure and effectively govern the waters, straits and coastline of the world’s second-largest archipelago. Since Marcos took office in June 2022, he has refocused national security from combating internal insurgents and crime to external defence.\n\nThe Philippines’ fisheries and maritime resources are crucial to the country’s economy. But policing its vast waters strains its coastguard, and the many straits cutting through its territory make it vulnerable to invasion and other foreign military incursions.\n\nThe Marcos government’s pushback against China’s claims over almost the entire South China Sea has attracted the most international attention, as Manila has publicised how Chinese coastguard ships try to assert control in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone by often violently targeting military or coastguard vessels.\n\nThe clashes were shown most dramatically in June near Manila’s military outpost at Second Thomas Shoal, where Chinese coastguard forces used axes and spears to hack at Philippine boats and a sailor lost a thumb.\n\n“I never expected someone who wants to be a superpower to behave like Vikings,” said Vice-Admiral Alfonso Torres, chief of the Philippine military’s Western Command.\n\nThe Chinese force claimed Philippine vessels had rammed a Chinese coastguard ship during what Beijing called a legitimate law enforcement operation against Philippine boats “illegally trespassing” in Chinese waters.\n\nBut since the two sides reached a temporary deal allowing the Philippines to resupply Second Thomas Shoal with less Chinese disruption, Manila has toned down its transparency strategy.\n\n“There will be listener fatigue. People will say: ‘What are these guys doing repeatedly banging their heads against the wall?’” said defence secretary Gilbert Teodoro. “Transparency will still be the principle, but we have to show the world that we strategise our moves.”\n\nIn September, the Philippine coastguard withdrew a ship from Sabina Shoal, another reef in its EEZ after a five-month deployment because its sailors had run out of food and water and the vessel needed repair after being rammed by a Chinese coastguard ship.\n\nChinese maritime militia and coastguard vessels have since massed in large numbers in the area.\n\nBut Philippine officials said Manila had to live with that. “It is not our territorial sea but the EEZ, so it is more our economic rights that are at stake,” said Malaya. “Given the limited resources the Philippine government has, we can presently tolerate these things so long as they don’t lead to land reclamation or new island building.”\n\nAndres Centino, chief adviser to Marcos on maritime policy, said the lesson from the Sabina episode was that having an extended physical presence at any isolated land feature was not a sustainable approach.\n\nInstead, he said, the Philippines would increasingly rely on satellites, drones and uncrewed surface vehicles to monitor Chinese activity.\n\nSome of those missions are now conducted by autonomous surface vessels provided by the US. Torres said the Western Command now had three Mantas, small uncrewed boats also known as T-12, and three Devil Rays, 11m-long autonomous speedboats. A group of US soldiers known as Task Force Ayungin are providing additional technical support.\n\nThe new systems were necessary to counter China’s use of various irregular tactics, said Torres.\n\nManila’s new capabilities are part of a modernisation drive aimed at enabling its military to protect the country’s entire maritime domain effectively.\n\nIn November, Marcos signed two laws outlining his country’s maritime zones and archipelagic sea lanes, designating just three sea lanes for international shipping traffic.\n\n“There are too many entry and exit points, and we do not have the capacity to monitor them all,” said Centino. Including the necessary communication with the International Maritime Organization, Manila expects to have a new, complete regulatory regime in place in about two years.\n\nTo implement it, the Philippines is upgrading runways and piers on some small outlying islands and planning several new naval bases and detachments, including on its Pacific-facing east coast, according to Teodoro.\n\n“It is not directed towards China,” said Centino.\n\nBut one area where Manila’s capabilities fall short is the Benham Rise, an undersea ridge off the east coast of Luzon which the UN has recognised as an extension of the Philippine continental shelf.\n\nChina has been conducting maritime surveys there, an indication that more friction between the two countries can be expected.",

    "body": "A Chinese state-sponsored actor hacked the US Treasury department through a third-party service provider in a “major cyber security incident”, the agency said on Monday.\n\nIn a letter to the Senate banking committee seen by the Financial Times, the Treasury department said it had been informed on December 8 by software company BeyondTrust that a hacker had breached several remote government workstations by obtaining a security key and had in turn gained access to unclassified documents on them.\n\n“Based on available indicators, the incident has been attributed to a China state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor,” the letter said. “In accordance with Treasury policy, intrusions attributable to an APT are considered a major cyber security incident.”\n\nThe department said it had been working with the FBI and other investigators in the wider intelligence community to determine the impact of the hack. It added that “at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information”.\n\nIn a separate statement on Monday, a Treasury spokesperson said the agency “takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds”.\n\n“We will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors,” the person added.\n\nLiu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said on Monday: “We hope that relevant parties will adopt a professional and responsible attitude when characterising cyber incidents, basing their conclusions on sufficient evidence rather than unfounded speculation and accusations.”\n\n“The US needs to stop using cyber security to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,” he added.\n\nThe breach is the latest cyber security violation involving US targets allegedly carried out on behalf of China.\n\nIn October, the Biden administration said it was investigating what the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said was “unauthorised access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China”. Hackers reportedly targeted the phones of president-elect Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance in the lead-up to the US election.\n\nUnderscoring the level of concern, the commerce department in September took steps to limit China’s access to Americans’ data by proposing a ban on Chinese software and hardware for vehicles with a built-in internet connection.",

    "body": "French stocks are on course to deliver their weakest annual performance since the depths of the Eurozone crisis, as investor worries over tariffs and political turmoil combine with lacklustre demand for luxury goods.\n\nParis’s Cac 40 index has fallen 3 per cent this year, compared with a 6 per cent gain for the region-wide Stoxx Europe 600, after a strong start to the year driven by bumper sales for companies such as LVMH melted away.\n\nInvestors have been put off by political crisis, sluggish demand from the key export market of China and a weakening domestic economy. The prospect of a trade war after US president-elect Donald Trump threatened sweeping tariffs on goods has added to the malaise.\n\n“So many things are happening at the same time [that] people want to stay away from French names,” said Roland Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy at the French bank Société Générale. “This downturn has been quite remarkable.”\n\nThe political turmoil has weighed heavily on the French market, analysts said, with François Bayrou becoming the country’s fourth prime minister this year.\n\nThat crisis has intensified a debate over how the country will tackle a growing budget deficit. Investor unease about the country’s fiscal situation has already pushed its 10-year borrowing costs above 3 per cent this year and the additional margin that France pays over benchmark German debt has reached its highest levels since the Eurozone debt crisis.\n\nEarlier this month Moody’s downgraded France’s credit rating following outgoing premier Michel Barnier’s government’s vote of no confidence, citing a “materially weaker” economic outlook.\n\nThe falling price of French stocks stands in stark contrast to neighbouring Germany, where a 18.7 per cent gain in the country’s stock market this year has defied the gloom enveloping its domestic economy.\n\nLuxury goods companies, which are a cornerstone of the Cac 40, have struggled as it has become clear that China’s economic recovery from the pandemic has stalled.\n\nThe rise of middle-class Chinese shoppers this century had transformed earnings for luxury goods companies, with consumers flocking to European and Asian capitals alike to buy designer handbags and other goods.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic then supercharged purchases as bored shoppers stuck at home spent furlough payments on accessories and premium alcohol. Profits at companies such as LVMH as well as beauty giant L’Oréal grew by double digits.\n\nBut Chinese shoppers have reined in their spending on concerns over a potential sharp economic slowdown. Beijing has announced sweeping plans to stimulate confidence in the economy and markets.\n\n“The big disappointment in China has probably reached a trough,” said Caroline Reyl, head of premium brands at Pictet Asset Management, adding that she is now waiting for the Chinese government stimulus to translate into consumer activity as she “doesn’t expect a worsening of the situation”.\n\nStill, more than one-fifth of the Cac 40’s constituents are consumer goods companies with “heavy” exposure to China, including LVMH and Kering — which are down 12 and 40 per cent this year, respectively.\n\nEmmanuel Cau, an analyst at Barclays, said the market was “split” on whether luxury goods companies would bounce back in 2025 or earnings would weaken again. He forecasts sector growth of just 3 per cent next year, at constant currency rates. “This was a year of pain,” he added.\n\nIt is a combination that puts the Cac 40 on track to being the only major stock market worldwide to end the year in negative territory.\n\nFrench banks and insurers, which make up 10 per cent of the benchmark, have fallen sharply as they are exposed to slowing economic growth and also hold substantial government debt, which investors now consider more risky.\n\nBNP Paribas, Europe’s biggest bank and often traded by investors as a proxy for the French economy, has fallen 8 per cent this year.\n\nIntense competition from China’s electric-vehicle makers and political turmoil has hit carmakers, including Stellantis. Shares in the company behind the Peugeot, Fiat and Jeep brands have fallen 41 per cent in Paris this year.\n\nAs the Cac 40 struggles, French companies have started to explore other capital markets. Pay TV operator Canal+ listed in London this month, although shares have slumped nearly 30 per cent since they began trading.\n\nTotalEnergies has said it is “seriously exploring” a US listing, while fast-growing asset manager Tikehau told the Financial Times last month that it was considering moving its listing from Paris to the US.\n\nHowever, France’s struggles are also a reflection of the challenges the continent’s politicians are now facing, which include stimulating growth and the looming prospect of a global trade war with sweeping tariffs after Trump’s election win.\n\nBarclays’ Cau added: “We need some kind of catalyst for Europe to take care of itself. It has been dependent on China but now the world is less globalised and China is growing less.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Ian Smith",

    "blurb": "Senior figures at more than 80 listed companies were held by local authorities in 2024, FT analysis finds",
    "date": "2024-12-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s central government is trying to curb a spate of detentions by local authorities of business executives that is fuelling anxiety among entrepreneurs and risks undercutting efforts to boost economic growth.\n\nA review of filings by the Financial Times found senior figures in more than 80 companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges were detained in 2024.\n\nChina’s securities regulator requires that listed companies disclose detentions of controlling shareholders, chairs, chief executives and other top managers, and the numbers suggest much broader action against executives across the country.\n\nSome of the detentions appeared to have little or no legal basis and in many cases were carried out by authorities based far from the target’s business operations, a practice Chinese media have dubbed “long-range fishing”. One leaked official document from the southern province of Guangdong said thousands of companies in a single city had been targets of action by authorities from other areas since 2023.\n\nPremier Li Qiang this month called for stronger supervision of company-related law enforcement, saying the government would review regions with abnormal income growth from fines and confiscations or high levels of enforcement outside their jurisdiction.\n\n“Instances of abuse of administrative discretion and unfair enforcement persist in certain areas and sectors,” Li said, according to the official news agency Xinhua. The premier added that it was essential to address “the pressing issues raised by citizens and businesses”.\n\nAnalysts said the high number of detentions might be linked to the deteriorating finances of local governments, which have suffered plummeting revenues from land sales amid a nationwide property crisis that has also slowed China’s economic growth.\n\n“My friends are getting squeezed from all sides,” said one top Chinese investor, who claimed some local governments were reviewing residents’ assets in order to target the wealthiest with fines.\n\nThe investor, who declined to be named and was himself forced to pay off a local authority about a decade ago in order to win release from detention, said some areas had turned to “long-range fishing”.\n\n“I accuse you of violations in my region and come and take you and make you pay,” he said, characterising local authorities’ attitudes. “It’s like a nationwide shakedown.”\n\nAbout half of the 82 listed company-related detentions in 2024 reviewed by the FT involved authorities from another region or an unspecified location.\n\nEugene Weng, a lawyer at Shanghai-based Wintell & Co, said some of his clients had experienced abusive law enforcement by authorities from other areas, adding that such practices were eroding confidence in the business environment.\n\n“The sense of anxiety has gone beyond imagination,” said Weng. “Entrepreneurs are thinking only about the short term, taking profits as soon as they can instead of investing in their businesses and transferring funds overseas as soon as possible.\n\n“This actually worsens tax revenues and employment,” he added, “causing local finances to fall into a vicious cycle.”\n\nThe internal report prepared for Guangdong provincial leaders in April, which was later leaked online, said cross-jurisdictional enforcement had ensnared a growing number of local companies.\n\nThe report said that since 2023, almost “10,000 enterprises in the city of Guangzhou had faced law enforcement from other areas, with the vast majority of cases involving private enterprises and a rather clear profit-seeking motive”.\n\nA Beijing-based entrepreneur said the detentions had created a climate of fear among founders. “It gets scary when you start to know people who’ve been detained,” he said. “The government needs to do something.”\n\nChina’s opaque enforcement system compounds these concerns. Companies said they and the families of detained executives received little information about their cases.\n\nThe board of “smart city” solutions provider Zhejiang Whyis Technology struggled to respond to a demand from securities regulators in March for more information on the detention of chief executive Ye Jianbiao.\n\nIn a filing, the board said that other than a notice from another city’s anti-corruption bureau that Ye was “under investigation for work-related crimes”, neither it nor Ye’s family had “received other formal notifications or documents”, nor were they “aware of the progress or conclusions of the investigation”.\n\nNine months later, the 51-year-old executive remains under detention. Ye could not be reached for comment. A company representative said they had no further information to provide on Ye’s case and that they would make an announcement as soon as he was released.\n\nSome provinces have begun publicising efforts to protect private companies. Prosecutors in eastern Zhejiang last month revealed that local police had helped foil the abduction of an entrepreneur surnamed Shen by officers from another area.\n\nAfter being abducted from his home, Shen fled from the police while being taken out of the province. Zhejiang police then arrested the two out-of-town officers, who initially claimed they were acting on their superiors’ orders and were eventually imprisoned.\n\nIn some cases, the detained executives ended up in the hands of authorities in areas where they did not appear to have any business.\n\nZhang Jian, 55, has spent more than two decades growing Aima Technology Group into one of China’s largest electric scooter makers. His family’s 73 per cent stake in the group is worth about Rmb19.5bn ($2.67bn), putting them at number 247 on the China “rich list” compiled by research group Hurun.\n\nBut in October, Aima announced that Zhang had been detained by an anti-corruption squad from Chengde, a city hundreds of kilometres from his home and the company’s headquarters in Tianjin. Aima does not hold any assets in Chengde, according to public filings.\n\n“They say it’s about his personal issues but won’t tell us more,” said an Aima manager who asked not to be named.\n\nThe manager said Aima had been able to send Zhang important company documents to sign from detention and that they hoped he would be released soon.\n\n“A lot of the detained chairmen get out in two or three months,” said the manager. “I can’t say how long ours will be in there, but this is the situation in the market.”\n\nData visualisation by Haohsiang Ko",

    "body": "The inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the US will take place on January 20 — the same day as the opening of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nSince the end of the cold war, the annual Davos meeting — which brings together business and political leaders from all over the world — has become a symbol of elite-driven globalisation.\n\nBut Trump is a sworn enemy of what he calls “globalism”. Davos-goers promote free trade; Trump says that “tariff” is his favourite word. The WEF hosts innumerable forums about international co-operation; Trump believes in “America First” nationalism.\n\nFor three decades, the world’s major powers broadly embraced the Davos worldview. This was a period when economic interdependence drowned out geopolitical rivalries. Trump, President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia have all spoken at the World Economic Forum in the past.\n\nBut now, in different ways, the US, China and Russia have all become revisionist powers that are seeking radical change to the current world order.\n\nWhen Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, he sacrificed his country’s economic ties to the west in favour of his vision of Russian grandeur. Xi’s China has become more nationalistic and more menacing in its behaviour towards Taiwan. And Trump is demanding fundamental changes to the international trading system and to America’s relationship with its allies.\n\nIt is not terribly surprising that Russia and China are demanding changes to the world order. Russia is a former superpower that is striving to rebuild its lost influence. China is a rising superpower that wants the world to accommodate its ambitions. It is American revisionism that is both most puzzling and most far-reaching in its consequences.\n\nThe US is still the world’s most powerful country and the world’s largest economy. The dollar is the world’s reserve currency and the American alliance system underpins the security of Europe, Asia and the Americas. If the US is serious about fundamentally rethinking its international commitments, then the entire world will have to adapt.\n\nAnd yet that appears to be what is happening. According to John Ikenberry of Princeton University, a leading theorist of international relations, “a revisionist state has arrived on the scene to contest the liberal international order . . . it is the United States. It’s Trump in the Oval Office, the beating heart of the free world.”\n\nAs Ikenberry sees it, Trump is poised to contest “almost every element of the liberal international order — trade, alliances, migration, multilateralism, solidarity between democracies, human rights”.\n\nAs a result, rather than supporting the international status quo, the US is poised to become the leading disrupter. “Every talk I’ve ever given on the geopolitical risks that we face in the world started with China and Russia,” says Ivo Daalder of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “But the biggest risk is us. It’s America.”\n\nAmerica’s traditional allies are among the countries that feel most threatened by a change in the way that the US exercises its power. Middle-power democracies such as the UK, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Germany and the entire EU have got used to a world in which American markets are open — and the US provides a security guarantee against threatening authoritarian powers.\n\nBut Trump is promising to impose tariffs on America’s closest allies and has called into question US security guarantees — including Nato’s Article 5, its mutual-defence clause. On one notorious occasion this year, the president-elect remarked that he would let Russia “do whatever the hell they want” with Nato countries that failed to meet their spending commitments on defence.\n\nThe threat posed by Trump to allied interests is already leading to agonised debates in some of the countries that he is targeting. When Chrystia Freeland resigned as Canada’s finance minister this month, she accused Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, of failing to recognise the “grave challenge” posed by America’s “aggressive economic nationalism, including a threat of 25 per cent tariffs”. Canada, she suggested, needed to keep its fiscal powder dry to prepare for a “coming tariff war”.\n\nThe question of whether and how to respond to Trump tariffs is exercising diplomatic minds across the western world. Finding an answer is all the more difficult because Trump’s true intentions remain unclear. Is the former and future president best understood as a dealmaker? Or is he a revolutionary — intent on blowing up the system, come what may?\n\nThe EU’s initial response will be to hope that Trump’s tariff threats are simply a negotiating tactic — and that a reasonable deal can be reached, well before an all-out trade war breaks out. But if Trump goes ahead with his threatened tariffs for a prolonged period, Brussels is likely to hit back.\n\nOther American allies such as Britain and Japan may respond differently. The UK government will hope that the Trump administration spares it from tariffs, perhaps because the US has a small trade surplus with the UK. Even if Britain is hit, the depth and importance of the security relationship between London and Washington will make any UK government think very hard before entering a trade war with the US.\n\nJapan, which has a large trade surplus with the US, is a much more obvious potential target for Trump tariffs. But Japanese officials think it unlikely that Tokyo would hit back. Like the British, the Japanese would be very reluctant to do anything that tempted a Trump administration to put American security guarantees on the table — as Washington’s next chip in a negotiation.\n\nThe need for America’s allies to balance trade priorities and national security reflects the fact that it is not just the global economic order that is under challenge. In Europe and Asia, the established balance of power is also under threat.\n\nWhen it comes to security, Russia and China are the most dangerous revisionists — because they are the nations that are demanding changes to international borders and adjustments to the global and regional security order.\n\nBoth Putin and Xi clearly see opportunities in the current global situation. In a recent speech to the Brics summit in Russia, Xi hailed the emergence of a new global era, “defined by turbulence and transformation”. Putin struck a similar note in a speech that he gave in Sochi on November 7, two days after Trump’s election, proclaiming: “Before our eyes, an entirely new world order is emerging.”\n\nAt times, Putin and Trump sound like they are reading from the same anti-woke hymn sheet. In his Sochi speech, the Russian leader defined his enemy as “liberal and globalist messianism” — sentiments that Trump could easily have echoed.\n\nBut while Trump believes that the new world order should increase America’s wealth and power, Putin’s central aim is to cut the US down to size. He told his audience in Sochi that “what is at stake is the west’s monopoly [of power] which emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union”.\n\nXi also sees the decline of western power as a central and desirable feature of the emerging new world order. The Chinese leader is fond of proclaiming that “the east is rising while the west is declining”. Both Russia and China are hoping to build up the Brics as a counterweight to the western-dominated G7.\n\nBeyond the generalities, both Putin and Xi have specific territorial demands in mind. In Washington and Brussels, it is now assumed that Russia is determined not just to hang on to the Ukrainian territory it has occupied, but also in effect to end the country’s independence by gaining a veto over Ukraine’s foreign and security policies, as well as setting up a Moscow-friendly government in Kyiv.\n\nWestern officials also note that Putin’s prewar demands extended well beyond Ukraine. In an ultimatum that the Kremlin issued in December 2021, Russian demands included the withdrawal of all Nato forces from the eastern European countries that joined the alliance after the collapse of the Soviet bloc.\n\nThe assumption inside Nato is that the war in Ukraine — and the immense losses inflicted on Russian forces by the western-backed Ukrainian forces — will have made Putin even more radical in his thinking. One senior European official says: “We need to understand that Russia thinks it is already at war with us.” An American counterpart adds that a Russian victory in Ukraine would present a “huge threat” to Nato.\n\nA perceived Russian victory in Ukraine would also resonate around the world, and particularly in China. One obvious possibility is that it would embolden Xi to pursue his own revisionist ambitions in Asia. Professor Steve Tsang of Soas, University of London, argues that Xi believes “taking Taiwan” is fundamental to his “China dream”. For Xi, victory in Taiwan would mark “the advent of China as the pre-eminent power” in the Indo-Pacific and ultimately the world.\n\nBeijing’s position is that Taiwan is internationally recognised as part of the People’s Republic of China. But the island is self-governing and its de facto independence could only be ended by intense Chinese pressure — or an invasion. In Beijing, Taiwan’s political leadership is portrayed as dangerous separatists. There has been much speculation in America that Xi has told his military to be ready to conquer the island by 2027. The date the Chinese leader himself has spoken of in public is 2050. On the other hand, Xi is now 71 years old. He may be tempted to try to secure his legacy relatively soon.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said several times that the US is prepared to go to war to defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, though Trump has made no such commitment. And while the incoming president is surrounded by China hawks, he himself has campaigned as a peace candidate — and has frequently expressed his admiration for both Xi and Putin.\n\nThe questions about how Trump will interpret his revisionist America First agenda are made even more complex by the fact that he will not be operating in an international vacuum. The US president will also have to respond to the actions and reactions of other foreign powers — in particular the revisionist leaders in Moscow and Beijing.\n\nGiven all the elements involved, there can be no certainties about how the new world order will evolve, only scenarios. So here are five possibilities.\n\nA new great power bargain: Trump’s transactional nature, his determination to avoid war and his contempt for democratic allies leads the US to strike a new grand bargain with Russia and China. The US tacitly grants Russia and China spheres of influence in their regions. America concentrates on asserting dominance in its own region — pushing around Mexico and Canada, and seeking to take back the Panama Canal and gain control over Greenland. Trump forces a peace deal on Ukraine without accompanying security guarantees. Sanctions against Russia are relaxed and Putin is welcomed to Thanksgiving dinner at Mar-a-Lago. A possible bargain with China would involve the easing of American tech restrictions and tariffs on Beijing, in return for Chinese purchases of American goods and sweetheart deals in China for US companies such as Tesla. Trump would also signal his lack of interest in fighting to defend Taiwan. US allies in Europe and Asia would be left scrambling to provide for their own defence in a new atmosphere of insecurity.\n\nWar by accident: The western allies have a trade war with each other. Political instability spreads in Europe, with the rise of populist forces sympathetic to both Trump and Putin. A ceasefire is agreed in Ukraine — but there is widespread fear in Europe that Russia will resume hostilities at some point. Trump himself repeatedly calls into question America’s willingness to defend its allies. China, Russia or North Korea — or some combination of these powers — decide to take advantage of western disarray by launching military action in Asia and Europe. But they miscalculate. Asian and European democracies fight back, and eventually the US gets drawn into the conflict, as happened twice in the 20th century.\n\nAnarchy in a leaderless world: The US, China, Russia and the EU avoid direct conflict. But Trump’s America First policies on trade, security and international institutions create a leadership vacuum. Economic growth is depressed across the world by Trump’s trade wars. Civil conflicts in countries such as Sudan and Myanmar intensify. The UN is debilitated by big power rivalry and is powerless to intervene. Instead conflicts are fuelled by competing regional powers that are seeking advantage and resources. More countries such as Haiti slide into violent anarchy. Refugee flows to the west increase. Populist parties, contemptuous of liberal democracy, flourish in an atmosphere of social and economic insecurity.\n\nGlobalisation without America: The US retreats behind tariff walls and leaves the World Trade Organization. Prices rise in America and goods get more shoddy. The rest of the world responds to American autarky by accelerating economic interdependence. The EU ratifies its new trade deal with Latin America and signs new agreements with India and China. Europe also opens its market to Chinese electric vehicles and green tech, in return for the Chinese setting up factories across the EU and restraining Russian aggression against Europe. The global south’s integration with the Chinese economy deepens further and the Brics gain new members and influence. The use of the dollar as the global currency declines.\n\nAmerica First succeeds: Trump’s faith in the irresistible nature of American power is vindicated. Investment is driven to the US, increasing America’s lead in tech and finance. The Europeans and Japanese sharply increase spending on their own defence and this is enough to deter Russian and Chinese aggression. American tariffs dramatically reduce Chinese growth, sending the Chinese system into crisis. The Iranian regime is finally felled by some combination of military, economic and domestic pressure. Trump’s prestige soars at home and abroad. American liberals are cowed into silence and some of Trump’s enemies are jailed. The stock market hits a new high.\n\nThe reality of the next four years is likely to be some strange amalgam of all of the above scenarios, plus several other unforeseen developments. As the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci, writing during the late 1920s, famously put it: “The old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.”\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nUS president’s takeover talk was learnt from Putin / From Nicholas Westcott, Professor of Practice in Diplomacy, Department of Politics and International Studies, Soas University of London, London WC1, UK",

    "body": "China has launched the world’s largest amphibious assault ship, in the latest demonstration of how Beijing’s industrial capacity is strengthening its military power amid rising geopolitical tensions with the US.\n\nCombining elements of amphibious landing vessels — which are designed to carry and support an invasion force — with those of an aircraft carrier, the ship significantly strengthens Beijing’s ability to project power globally. It also adds to China’s capabilities in the event of an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nChinese navy officials christened the ship Sichuan in a ceremony on Friday at the Hudong Shipyard in Shanghai while its dock slowly filled with water, according to Chinese official media reports.\n\nThe launch came a day after test flights of prototypes for a new Chinese fighter jet. According to videos posted online by Chinese internet users, the aircraft were spotted over the north-eastern city of Shenyang and the south-western city of Chengdu on Thursday. The two cities host institutes developing rival projects for a new stealth fighter.\n\nA mock-up of the Chengdu model was on display at China’s twice-yearly Zhuhai air show last month, where China debuted the J-35, its latest stealth fighter.\n\nAlthough the exact specifications of the fighter prototypes remain unclear and it could be years from entering service, the test flights and launch of the amphibious assault ship underscored Beijing’s rapid production of new military hardware. It also comes at a time when capacity bottlenecks have started to constrain the expansion of Washington’s military arsenal.\n\nThe People’s Liberation Army started tendering for the design and construction of the new amphibious ship, which is called Type 076, just four years ago. The PLA Navy has three amphibious assault ships, the first of which only entered service in 2021.\n\nThe new class is not only much larger than those of its Type 075 predecessor, and can carry more aircraft or amphibious landing vessels on a lower deck. It is also equipped with an electromagnetic launch system, suggesting large drones and even crewed fighter aircraft can take off from its deck. Traditional amphibious assault ships typically only carry helicopters.\n\nChinese military commentator Song Zhongping has called the new class a “light aircraft carrier”. At 260 metres, it is longer than the America Class, the US Navy’s largest amphibious assault ship, and the Izumo, a Japanese class of helicopter carriers.\n\n“With this, we are entering the four-carrier era!” said a Chinese military enthusiast who often posts pictures and comments on new PLA weapons systems. The Fujian, the PLA Navy’s third aircraft carrier, is undergoing sea trials after its launch earlier this year.\n\nUS think-tank CSIS estimated in August that China’s new ship would have a displacement of 50,000 tonnes, compared with the America Class’s 45,000. Chinese official reports on Friday put its displacement at “more than 40,000” tonnes.\n\n​Letter in response to this article:\n\nAmphibious assault ships are ‘light aircraft carriers’ / From Terence R Murphy, One-time US Navy “amphib” Officer, Bethesda, MD, US",

    "body": "In its heyday, the money sloshing through the tiny former Portuguese colony of Macau took some beating. At its peak in 2013, Macau casino revenues hit $45bn — nearly seven times that of Las Vegas casinos combined. But the era of Macau’s unrivalled position as the destination for the cash piles of mainland gamblers may be coming to an end.\n\nA lucrative business model traditionally underpinned the Las Vegas of Asia, a special administrative region of China since 1999. Junkets — or all expenses-paid gambling trips — for mainland Chinese high rollers to play at designated casinos was one of the territory’s core revenue generators. High rollers were able to bet multiples of their chips on the table. All this was turbocharged by large credit lines and unlicensed money exchanges.\n\nBeijing has been increasing enforcement of currency transfer quotas and controls in recent years. Underground banks and unlicensed currency exchanges in Macau have played a key role in facilitating evasion of these currency controls, often through the junket accounts of casinos. By some esti­mates, ill-gotten funds channelled through Macau exceeded $200bn at its peak in 2013. Some Macau casinos also signed up mainland Chinese gamblers to their overseas platforms, where illegal online gambling brought in another revenue stream.\n\nA key development this year put those revenues at risk. In October, a gambling crimes bill which criminalises unlicensed money exchanges — widely used by local casinos and gamblers — was passed by Macau’s legislature. This would be highly effective in enforcing Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on illicit capital outflows from China through gambling in Macau.\n\nThe move creates a formidable challenge for Macau’s casinos. Most of Macau’s visitors come from the mainland, with Chinese visitors accounting for nearly 70 per cent of the total, according to government data. Chinese high rollers make up less than 1 per cent of the city’s gamblers, but accounted for three-quarters of gaming revenue.\n\nSo far, it is quiet. This year, battered stocks of local casinos have staged a comeback after a sharp sell-off during the pandemic. Shares of SJM Holdings are up more than 10 per cent in the past year. That reflects Macau’s rising visitor arrivals — up a third in the first three quarters of this year — and growing gaming revenues, up 15 per cent in November to $2.3bn. MGM China Holdings has had a roller-coaster year to end up broadly flat.\n\nIn December Sam Hou Fai, a Beijing-backed former top judge will take office as Macau’s new leader, which could mean stricter regulatory oversight. MGM China trades at just eight times forward earnings, about half that its peers in Las Vegas. That gap is here to stay as long as mainland Chinese gamblers stay away.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com",

    "body": "Not until Kim reached middle school in Beijing did she discover that a piece of Communist party bureaucracy would shape her life — as it does for many of China’s 1.4bn people.\n\nBecause her family was not originally from Beijing, she was required under arcane residence laws known as the hukou system to finish her schooling and sit the country’s gruelling university entrance exam in her parents’ distant home village.\n\nThe daughter of successful businesspeople, Kim refused to go, arguing she had never lived in the village. This cost her access to university, ruining her career prospects.\n\n“The hukou system has caused me many problems,” said Kim, who is now in her 30s and works at her cousin’s small company. The system “represents inequality and has affected me throughout my life”.\n\nChina’s hukou system, which in effect treats people with rural household registrations as second-class citizens, has long been seen as deeply socially regressive. But recent anaemic growth is putting increasing scrutiny on the system’s cost to the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nXi Jinping’s government, which is trying to pep up consumption and counter a property market slump, in July released a five-year plan calling for the relaxation of hukou rules in mid-sized cities to “fully unleash the huge domestic demand potential” from urbanisation, which has slowed since the pandemic.\n\nBut Beijing has tinkered many times before with the system, introduced in 1958 by Mao Zedong to control population movements into the cities from rural areas. Many scholars believe the government should go further and scrap the system altogether.\n\n“Abolishing the hukou system could provide just the sort of growth momentum that Xi needs to revive confidence in the Chinese economy,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.\n\nBecause a hukou governs access to local government services, having one from China’s wealthiest municipalities, particularly Beijing and Shanghai, entitles the holder to the best education and healthcare, easier access to stable government jobs and other privileges.\n\nAbandoning hukou would encourage more rural workers to move to more productive jobs in cities, said analysts. While massive migration to China’s cities in recent decades has lifted the country’s headline urbanisation rate to 66 per cent as of last year from 43 per cent in 2005, at least a quarter of city dwellers lack an urban hukou. Many migrant workers crowd into neighbourhoods on the margins of the big cities, such as Yuxinzhuang in northern Beijing.\n\nScrapping the system would give migrant workers better access to public health and education, leaving them with “more money free for consumption, which means you address some of the broader economic imbalances that China’s facing”, said Thomas.\n\nBut fully scrapping hukou would be “easier said than done”, Ivy‐sw Ng, Asia-Pacific chief investment officer at DWS, wrote in a note this month.\n\nResidents of first-tier municipalities would resist losing their privileges, while city governments would balk at the cost of investing in additional infrastructure and services. Many of the 298mn migrant workers who already live in urban areas lack access to the best healthcare, education and public services.\n\nFurthermore, the Communist party still uses the system to maintain social control. Xi, in particular, has said China needs to prevent a concentration of the population in the largest cities. The system is controlled by the Ministry of Public Security, which has little interest in reform, said scholars.\n\nThe challenge for the government is that “they have already done whatever is possible [on hukou] without changing the fundamental political system”, said Ernan Cui, analyst at research group Gavekal.\n\nWhile some smaller cities have abandoned hukou altogether as part of gradual reforms, obtaining one in China’s largest municipalities, particularly Beijing and Shanghai, has become even more difficult, according to Yao Yang, a prominent Chinese professor and author.\n\nOutsiders seeking a Beijing hukou need to satisfy a points system that takes into consideration their university degree, professional abilities and ability to pay tax — tougher criteria than what many countries impose on foreign immigrants.\n\nA Beijing hukou can also be obtained through marriage rules or by birth. Shanghai’s system is almost equally strict.\n\nIn China’s first-tier cities, a hukou gives access to 20 different rights, said Yao in a public speech earlier this year. This starts with direct access to the nation’s best schools, which are often in central Beijing and Shanghai and offer students superior preparation for university.\n\nWang, a Beijing resident from a family with deep roots in the capital, said that as hukou holders in the city’s elite central Xicheng District, her parents got good government jobs and she went to top schools.\n\n“I won’t need to worry about my children’s schooling either,” she said. “Having a hukou here grants you direct access to these resources, whereas people without a Beijing hukou have to pay a lot — financially and otherwise — to access them.”\n\nAs Kim discovered, one of the most important privileges a Beijing hukou grants the holder is the right to complete high school and sit the gaokao, the university entrance exam, in the capital.\n\nThe country’s most elite universities, which are concentrated in Beijing and Shanghai, generally offer higher entrance quotas for students sitting the exam in those cities.\n\nThe populous central province of Henan, for instance, has about 20 times more students sitting the gaokao than Shanghai and Beijing, but admission rates for Henan’s students are only about a fifth of the rates achieved by applicants from the biggest cities.\n\nPrivileges such as these make a Beijing hukou so valuable that some employers offer it as part of their pay packages.\n\n“At our company, hukou and salaries are taboo topics,” said Qiqi, a native of Henan who worked at a tech company in Beijing that helped her obtain a hukou in the city. “Discussing them is not allowed because these represent unequal resources and could cause dissatisfaction.”\n\nWhen she did eventually post on social media about getting a Beijing hukou, men began asking her for dates “clearly because of my hukou”, she said.\n\nOutside China’s wealthy metropolises, the benefits of hukou become more varied.\n\nMaomao, who grew up in Urumqi, the capital of western China’s Xinjiang region, said she was lucky her mother was a civil servant at a government agency. Her family was allocated a house with a hukou that allowed her “to attend the best elementary and middle schools in Urumqi”.\n\nEven when smaller cities relax hukou requirements for low-skilled migrant workers, they often spurn the offer because they would have to give up their rural hukou, which would mean abandoning family landholdings in their villages.\n\nMany migrant workers who rent housing are also unable to fully benefit from a city hukou, which favours property owners in the provision of services such as education.\n\n“Getting a hukou in lower-tier cities isn’t difficult,” said Maomao, who eventually swapped her Urumqi hukou for one in Nanjing, eastern China. “Hukou is essentially a stepping stone . . . it grants access to resources like housing and education for children, but beyond that, it doesn’t mean much.”\n\nBut it remains important in China’s largest cities, argued Kim. Without a Beijing hukou, she could only buy a less desirable flat with higher management fees. Beijing’s traffic congestion rules, which favour hukou holders, forced her to pay more to own a car.\n\nA lifetime after Mao introduced it, the hukou system has had such a profound effect on Kim’s life that she has begun to question whether she really belongs in the city of her upbringing.\n\n“When people ask me where I’m from, I feel awkward,” she said. “I’ve grown up in Beijing, but I don’t have a Beijing hukou. Am I a Beijinger?”",

    "date": "2024-12-2600:00:00.0",
    "body": "The World Bank has raised its near-term economic forecasts for China while repeating calls for President Xi Jinping to pursue deep reforms to address lagging confidence and structural problems in the world’s second-biggest economy.\n\nThe multilateral lender said on Thursday that it had revised its forecast for China’s GDP growth next year upwards by 0.4 percentage points to 4.5 per cent, reflecting a series of policy-easing measures announced by Beijing over the past three months as well as the strength of the country’s exports.\n\nThe World Bank also raised its full-year forecast for this year by 0.1 percentage points to 4.9 per cent, just shy of Beijing’s own growth target for 2024 of about 5 per cent. The economy recorded growth of 4.8 per cent in the first nine months of the year.\n\nThe lender also noted recent pledges by Xi’s economic planners to improve support for social welfare and consumption, and also to implement fiscal and tax reforms. But it said greater detail was needed to bolster household and business confidence.\n\n“Conventional stimulus measures will not be sufficient to reinvigorate growth,” the World Bank said, reiterating its calls for deeper reforms across China’s education, healthcare, social welfare protections, pensions and the hukou household registration system.\n\nChina’s economic growth has slowed this year under weak domestic demand and deep deflationary pressures, following a three-year slump in the property market that hammered household wealth.\n\nXi had pivoted the economic focus towards investment in high-tech manufacturing and industry, but there is rising concern that exports, which have helped to shore up growth, will face a renewed threat of tariffs under Donald Trump, who will return as US president next month.\n\nThe World Bank also released a new analysis of economic mobility in China for 2010-21, which showed that more than half a billion people were potentially at risk of falling out of the middle class just a generation after rising out of poverty, according to its definitions.\n\nThe bank credited Beijing with the “dramatic success” of lifting 800mn people out of poverty in the past 40 years, and it noted that over the period the low-income share of the population fell sharply, from 62.3 per cent to 17 per cent.\n\nBut it also found that 38.2 per cent of China’s 1.4bn people were in the “vulnerable middle class” — above its defined low-income line but not “free of the risk of falling below it”. The low-income level was defined as up to $6.85 per day using 2017 purchasing power parity calculations.\n\n“No other region of the world witnessed a faster increase in the share of the secure middle-class population than China,” the World Bank said. “Yet, a sizeable majority of the population is not yet economically secure.”\n\nThat vulnerable segment of the population was bigger than the 32.1 per cent considered “secure” in the middle class and the 17 per cent which remained low-income as of 2021, in the middle of the Covid pandemic.\n\nBert Hofman, a former Beijing-based country director for China at the World Bank, now at the National University of Singapore, wrote earlier this month that the Chinese economy’s lacklustre post-Covid performance had exposed weaknesses built since the last substantial revamp of the fiscal system in 1994.\n\nHowever, he noted some “hopeful signals” that reforms were in the pipeline, following policymakers’ statements in the second half of 2024 that pointed to improving income distribution and social security.\n\n“Fiscal reforms are now clearly tied to the Chinese Communist party’s core goal of ‘high-quality growth’, and the leadership recognises that reforms should result in a fiscal system that can deliver on efficiency, equity, and stability,” Hofman wrote in a 2025 forecast for Asia Society.\n\n“A key question is whether the reforms will go far enough to turn fiscal policy into a powerful tool for resource allocation, economic stability, and income distribution.”",

    "body": "Electric vehicles are expected to outsell cars with internal combustion engines in China for the first time next year, in a historic inflection point that puts the world’s biggest car market years ahead of western rivals.\n\nChina is set to smash international forecasts and Beijing’s official targets with domestic EV sales — including pure battery and plug-in hybrids — growing about 20 per cent year on year to more than 12mn cars in 2025, according to the latest estimates supplied to the Financial Times by four investment banks and research groups. The figure would be more than double the 5.9mn sold in 2022.\n\nAt the same time, sales of traditionally powered cars are expected to fall by more than 10 per cent next year to less than 11mn, reflecting a near 30 per cent plunge from 14.8mn in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, EV sales growth has slowed in Europe and the US, reflecting the legacy car industry’s slow embrace of new technology, uncertainty over government subsidies and rising protectionism against imports from China.\n\nRobert Liew, director of Asia-Pacific renewables research at Wood Mackenzie, said China’s EV milestone signalled its success in domestic technology development and securing global supply chains for critical resources needed for EVs and their batteries. The industry’s scale meant steep manufacturing cost reductions and lower prices for consumers.\n\n“They want to electrify everything,” said Liew. “No other country comes close to China.”\n\nWhile the pace of Chinese EV sales growth has eased from a post-pandemic frenzy, the forecasts suggest Beijing’s official target, set in 2020, for EVs to account for 50 per cent of car sales by 2035, will be achieved 10 years ahead of schedule. Norway leads the world in EV sales as a share of the market, with more than 90 per cent of new cars battery-powered.\n\nThe industry forecasts were provided to the FT by investment banks UBS and HSBC, as well as research groups Morningstar and Wood Mackenzie.\n\nThey imply that over the coming decade, factories set up in China to produce tens of millions of cars with traditional engines will have almost no domestic market to serve.\n\nThey also highlight how the rapid rise of the Chinese EV industry now threatens the national manufacturing champions of Germany, Japan and the US.\n\nAs China’s EV market tracked towards year-on-year growth of near 40 per cent in 2024, the market share of foreign-branded cars fell to a record low of 37 per cent — a sharp decline from 64 per cent in 2020, according to data from Automobility, a Shanghai-based consultancy.\n\nIn this month alone, GM wrote down more than $5bn of its business value in China; the holding company behind Porsche warned of a writedown in its Volkswagen stake of up to €20bn; and arch rivals Nissan and Honda said they were responding to a “drastically changing business environment” with a merger.\n\nChinese carmakers face their own internal rivalry. Yuqian Ding, a veteran Beijing-based analyst with HSBC, said that while EVs were now a “strategically important” part of China’s new, high-tech economy, intense competition was expected to “squeeze” more players out of the market as the industry consolidated.\n\n“While China’s domestic EV sector is clearly flourishing, it is also facing slowing growth — from a very high base — models oversupply, intense competition and a price war,” she said. “The longer-term direction of travel is clear — China’s EV juggernaut is unstoppable.”\n\nTu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, said the industry was only at “the beginning” of a period of unparalleled upheaval.\n\nVincent Sun, an equity analyst covering China’s car sector for investment research group Morningstar, noted that several multinational carmakers, including Germany’s Volkswagen, were not expecting to release major new EV models in China until late 2025 or 2026.\n\nHSBC estimated about 90 new car models had been planned for release by manufacturers in China in the fourth quarter of 2024 — about one a day — and nearly 90 per cent were EVs.\n\nStill, Paul Gong, head of Chinese automotive research at UBS, cautioned there was some uncertainty over China’s broader economic policy heading into 2025 and forecast the market would have a “weak start to the year” after a robust finish to 2024.\n\nBut he added: “We anticipate . . . a strong surge in purchases at the end of 2025, driven by the expiration of subsidies and the imposition of a 5 per cent purchase tax on electric vehicles in 2026 — compared to 0 per cent until the end of 2025.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Richard Milne in Oslo",

    "body": "Environmental, social and governance funds run by global managers have at least $1.4bn allocated to 14 electric vehicle and solar companies linked to forced labour in Xinjiang, according to an analysis by Ignites Asia.\n\nAmid growing scrutiny of Chinese and foreign firms operating in the region, the findings shed light on risks for fund firms that fail or are unable to conduct thorough due diligence on Chinese supply chains of investee companies, experts say.\n\nMost of this sustainable investment, totalling US$1.1bn, has been invested in Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world’s biggest EV and energy storage battery manufacturer, according to Morningstar data analysed by Ignites Asia.\n\nCATL’s operations have increasingly drawn the attention of politicians and academics in recent years.\n\nIn June, the Republican-led US House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist party said that it had uncovered new evidence linking CATL to CCP state-sponsored forced labour and human rights abuses against the Xinjiang minority.\n\nThis followed a report by researchers at the Helena Kennedy Center for International Justice at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, who said that CATL’s expansion into the Xinjiang region in 2022 raised concerns about potential links to forced labour in its supply chain.\n\nCATL had denied the allegations, calling them “groundless and completely false”.\n\nActively managed global ESG funds have $789mn invest in CATL, while passive funds contributed $263mn, according to Morningstar data.\n\nThe largest investors were BlackRock, Nordea and Ninety One, with $148mn, $93mn and $86mn respectively.\n\nNinety One and BlackRock both declined to comment.\n\nBlackRock’s actively managed BGF Future of Transport Fund, which invests in future transport technologies and takes ESG criteria into account in its decisions, had $48mn invested in CATL, as of September.\n\nThe Nordea 2 - Global Responsible Enhanced Equity Fund and Ninety One Global Environment Fund held investments of $37mn and $86mn in CATL respectively, as of October.\n\nEric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management, said: “We are aware of the risks related to forced labour in the global EV supply chain, and have performed our own research and engagement in that context, as well as investing reports in media and from the multiple ESG data providers we use.\n\n“The latest public statement made by the company was in November 2024 — denying any relation with suppliers from that region, in response to a US congress letter.\n\n“CATL has since clarified that they had an investment relationship with Jiangxi Zhicun in the past, as a minority shareholder in September 2021, and sold its equity interest in its entirety to Chengdao Capital in March 2023,” said Pedersen.\n\nChloe Cranston, head of thematic advocacy at Anti-Slavery International, said: “There’s no such thing as a sustainable investment if it’s based on Xinjiang forced labour.\n\n“We are at risk of making mistakes of the past with the transition to clean energy, and many communities may have their lives decimated because of it,” she said.\n\nSam Goodman, London-based senior policy director at China Strategic Risks Institute, suggested that allocation to such companies cast doubt on the very reason that ESG funds were established in the first place.\n\n“The whole idea of ESG was created by global asset managers who realised that they could make even more money and get even more assets under management if they said that they were going to invest it in a green and ethical way.”\n\nHe added that it was wrong that different aspects of ESG investing were “placed off against each other” and that green investment should not have to come at the expense of human rights.\n\n“Those who present it as a trade-off are creating a false economy,” said Goodman. There was “more than enough room” to adhere to both principles, he added.\n\nGoodman said that in many cases fund firms that outsourced their due diligence to third-party index publishers were “not really paying attention” to associated risks.\n\n“If you can’t properly audit these companies to figure out their supply chain and the extent to source labour within it, should you be investing in them at all?” Goodman said.\n\nAnti-Slavery International’s Cranston stressed that rather than relying on ESG data providers, it should be the responsibility of asset managers to do more to ensure portfolios were invested ethically given the scrutiny on how ESG funds are invested.\n\n“The only responsible thing to do is divestment,” Cranston added.\n\nFew asset managers and data providers speak out publicly about these challenges and there is a lack of transparency on investee company operations in China due to pressure from the Chinese government.\n\nAnita Dorett, director at the Investor Alliance for Human Rights, explained that China’s actions had a “chilling effect” that might deter asset managers from divesting or speaking out.\n\nShe said: “Some of them have clients or offices in China there, and they have to be very concerned about their staff’s safety.”\n\nShe added that a small number of fund houses had “quietly stepped away” from companies involved in Xinjiang forced labour.\n\nDorett suggested that a “sector-wide divestment” would be most effective, making it harder to single out individual companies.\n\n“If you do it on a company by company basis, it’s very easy to target a company and make them an example.”\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

    "date": "2024-12-2500:00:00.0",
    "body": "China has stepped up a nationwide campaign to convince single people to date, marry and have children as Beijing grapples with an increasingly severe demographic crisis.\n\nLocal governments are cold-calling married women to ask about their plans to have children and are handing out cash to parents to encourage them to have more than one child.\n\nUniversities have been asked to introduce so-called love courses for single students, and regular articles appear in state media about the benefits of having children.\n\nChina’s population is shrinking, with the number of deaths outstripping births, piling pressure on local governments to address an increasingly bleak demographic outlook.\n\n“China’s population faces three major trends: ageing, low birth and low marriage rates,” said prominent economist Ren Zeping in an interview with domestic press last month. “There are fewer children and more elderly people. The speed and scale of China’s ageing is unprecedented.”\n\nBeijing has pledged to offer subsidies and bigger tax cuts for parents to reduce the cost of raising children. The State Council, China’s cabinet, in October said it was drafting a plan to build a “birth-friendly society” as part of a broader stimulus package to tackle an ailing economy. Details of this plan are still being thrashed out.\n\nIn the meantime, married women in their twenties and early thirties across the country have been receiving calls from local officials asking about their plans to start a family, according to multiple people who spoke with the Financial Times and posts on social media.\n\nIn some instances, callers asked women to attend prenatal body checks. Other callers were more direct, offering subsidies to women who had more than one child. Couples need to have on average 2.1 children to reach the population replacement rate.\n\nA Zhejiang resident who declined to be named said officials offered local women a Rmb100,000 ($14,000) subsidy for having a second child. “There is no explicit policy, but if you ask for it, the village will find you a way to get you the subsidy,” she said. Currently, subsidies for children are determined by local governments depending on their fiscal health.\n\nThe personalised lobbying comes against a background of an intensified media campaign hailing the benefits of childbirth. In recent months, the state-run People’s Daily and Life Times have promoted scientific voices saying childbirth is good for the mother’s health and can even help prevent cancer and treat certain diseases.\n\nA state-run publication by the National Health Commission in December called on universities to set up “marriage and love education courses” to encourage students to couple up.\n\n“Universities are an important place for college students to fall in love,” it wrote, citing a survey that 57 per cent of students said they did not want to get into a relationship due to their heavy workload.\n\nThe article proposed that universities introduce courses on the theory of love and real-life case analysis to promote a “systematic knowledge of love and marriage”.\n\nHowever, experts are sceptical that official measures to bolster the birth rate will persuade young people to start families, especially as rising unemployment and tepid economic growth have reined in spending.\n\nWang Feng, an expert on Chinese demographics at the University of California, Irvine, said officials were resorting to the same “playbook of using administrative power to achieve demographic goals” that was evident during the one-child policy era, the 35 years from 1980 when families were restricted to having one child.\n\nWhile Beijing successfully stopped couples from having multi-child families, it was harder to use administrative powers to achieve the opposite result, he said. “Such old wine in a new bottle will not be effective, as the rationale underlying late marriage and low fertility are entirely different.”\n\nShen Yang, a feminist writer, said people could “see through the propaganda”.\n\n“If the government wants to bolster the birth rate, it should create a more friendly environment for parents, especially single mothers,” she said.\n\nWhile Beijing is encouraging births, there are no signs that it has limited access to birth control or abortions. Although there may be specific instances of doctors refusing to carry out procedures, these often reflected concern about legal action from family members, said a gynaecologist in Beijing.\n\nStill, Wang said authorities had an uphill battle convincing “young women and men today, who belong to the most educated generation in Chinese history” to have children.\n\n“For young women especially, they not only face high living costs but also severe career penalties when they leave their work position to have children.”",

    "blurb": "Sales and listings of Chinese companies by world’s biggest buyout groups have ground to a halt, data shows",
    "date": "2024-12-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "The world’s biggest private equity groups have been unable to sell or list their China-based portfolio companies this year, as Beijing’s crackdown on initial public offerings and a slowing economy leave foreign investors’ capital trapped in the country.\n\nAmong the 10 largest global private equity groups with operations in China, there is no record of any having listed a Chinese company this year or fully sold their stake through an M&A deal, figures from Dealogic show.\n\nIt is the first year for at least a decade where this has been the case, though the pace of exits has been slow since Beijing introduced restrictions on Chinese companies’ ability to list in 2021.\n\nBuyout groups rely on being able to sell or list companies, typically within three to five years of buying them, in order to generate returns for the pension funds, insurance companies and others whose money they manage.\n\nThe difficulties in doing so have in effect left those investors’ funds locked away, with future returns uncertain.\n\n“There’s a growing sense among PE investors that China may not be as systemically investable as once thought,” said Brock Silvers, chief executive of Hong Kong private equity group Kaiyuan Capital.\n\nHe said firms were facing “weakened exit strategies on multiple fronts” in China, including being affected by a slower economy and domestic regulatory pressure.\n\nMany private equity groups expanded their presence in the world’s second-biggest economy as it grew rapidly over the past two decades. Global pension funds and others ploughed capital into the country, hoping to gain exposure to its economic boom.\n\nThe 10 firms invested $137bn over the past decade, but total exits amount to just $38bn, Dealogic data shows. New investment by those groups has collapsed to just $5bn since the start of 2022.\n\nThe pace of buyout groups’ exits from deals globally has also been slowing. It was down 26 per cent in the first half of this year, according to a report by S&P Global.\n\nBut the halt in China exits is particularly stark. It has helped make some pension funds that allocate cash to private equity groups warier of exposure to the country.\n\n“In theory, you could buy cheaply [in China] now but you need to ask what would happen if you can’t exit or if you have to hold it for longer,” said a private markets specialist at a large pension fund that is not currently investing in the country.\n\nA senior executive at a major investment group that commits cash to private equity funds said they were “not expecting a lot of exits for the next couple of years at least” in China.\n\nThe data covers Blackstone, KKR, CVC, TPG, Warburg Pincus, Carlyle Group, Bain Capital, EQT, Advent International and Apollo, the 10 largest buyout groups by funds raised for private equity over the past decade, excluding those that have done no deals in China. The data does not include Blackstone real estate deals.\n\nPrivate equity firms sometimes buy or sell companies without disclosing it, and any such exits may be missing from the data. The firms declined to comment.\n\nThe difficulty in cashing out has been one of the main factors deterring international buyout groups from making investments in the country, in addition to Sino-US tensions and the economic slowdown.\n\nJean Salata, founder of Barings Private Equity Asia, which Stockholm-based EQT bought in 2022, told the Financial Times in June that one reason the “bar is high” for China deals was that investors were asking: “How easy will it be to get liquidity on those investments five years from now?”\n\nForeign buyout groups used to rely on taking Chinese companies public in the US or other countries in order to exit their investments after a few years. But Beijing has introduced new restrictions on offshore listings since cracking down on the ride-hailing app DiDi, in the wake of its New York IPO in 2021. Listings have slowed significantly since.\n\nIn total this year, there have been just $7bn of domestic IPOs in China as of late November, compared with $46bn last year, which was already the lowest total since 2019.\n\nThe crackdown has left buyout groups searching for other options, such as selling their stakes to domestic and multinational companies and to other buyout groups. But overseas buyers are sometimes reluctant, in part because of closer US political scrutiny of the mainland.\n\nOne of the few recent exits among the 10 firms came when Carlyle sold its minority stake in the Chinese operations of McDonald’s back to the US fast-food retailer last year.\n\nIn China’s boom years before the Covid-19 pandemic, there were dozens of exits through both listings and mergers and acquisitions, and foreign private equity played a much bigger role in driving mainland activity.\n\nGoldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon said at a Hong Kong conference in November that one of the reasons investors were “predominantly on the sidelines” over deploying funds in China was that “it’s been very difficult . . . to get capital out”.",

    "date": "2024-12-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The US has launched a probe into alleged anti-competitive measures by China to support its semiconductor industry, just weeks before the Biden administration hands over to president-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe US Trade Representative’s office said it was investigating “China’s acts, policies and practices related to targeting of the semiconductor industry for dominance”.\n\nThe probe will be conducted under Section 301 of the US Trade Act and initially target what the USTR called “foundational” semiconductors, including those used by the automotive, healthcare, infrastructure, aerospace and defence industries.\n\nIt marks the latest in a worsening tit-for-tat trade war over semiconductors, sparking fears of serious disruptions to international supply chains.\n\nPotential outcomes of a Section 301 investigation include import restrictions or new tariffs on shipments from China of the kinds of chips used in cars, household appliances and consumer devices — a decision that would fall to the Trump administration.\n\nWashington on Monday accused China of using “extensive anti-competitive and non-market means, including setting and pursuing market share targets, to achieve indigenisation and self-sufficiency”. China’s alleged tactics were designed to achieve dominance of the semiconductor industry in China and on global markets, the USTR said.\n\nAfter several years of focusing its semiconductor policies on the most cutting-edge processors necessary for creating advanced artificial intelligence, Washington is turning its attention more to the mature end of the market, with chips manufactured using what the industry calls “legacy” production systems.\n\nMakers of advanced chip manufacturing equipment, such as ASML, are already restricted from selling their most sophisticated tools to Chinese chipmakers, holding back China’s advances in AI and curtailing its efforts to build a rival to Silicon Valley-based Nvidia.\n\nHowever, that has not prevented Chinese chipmakers from making huge investments to scale up production of legacy semiconductors. Some analysts estimate that China is on track to double its chip manufacturing capacity by the end of the decade, boosted by subsidies from Beijing.\n\nThe commerce ministry in Beijing said it was “firmly opposed” to the latest 301 investigation, and that action would disrupt global supply chains and hurt the interest of US companies and global consumers.\n\nIt noted that US companies dominate the global chip market and the US government has provided “huge” subsidies to its domestic chip industry. Beijing also issued a thinly veiled warning of retaliation, saying China would “take all necessary measures” to defend its rights.\n\nUS and European semiconductor executives have warned that local chipmakers could suffer from the same kind of problems that the flood of low-cost Chinese solar panel imports has caused western producers in recent years. Relying on Chinese suppliers could also create national security issues for the US, officials fear.\n\nOften overlooked amid the hype around AI, the significance of legacy semiconductors became apparent during the Covid-19 pandemic, when factory shutdowns triggered widespread shortages of everyday electronic goods.\n\nA report by the US Department of Commerce earlier this month found that China’s recent increase in production of mature-node semiconductors “has already begun to cause pricing pressure that may weaken US chip suppliers’ competitive positions”.\n\nMore than two-thirds of US companies’ products use chips produced in Chinese foundries, the report said.\n\nChina has for decades viewed its dependence on the US and other countries as a fundamental national security vulnerability. But it has struggled to shake its reliance on foreign companies for the key design and manufacturing technologies needed to make increasingly sophisticated chips.\n\nEarlier this month, Washington issued new export controls targeting China’s ability to make the most advanced chips, including tougher restrictions on shipping semiconductor manufacturing tools and a ban on exports of advanced memory chips needed in AI hardware.\n\nBeijing swiftly hit back, banning the shipment to the US of key minerals and metals used in chip production. It also opened its own investigation into Nvidia for suspected violations of the country’s anti-monopoly law.",

    "body": "Sweden has sharply criticised China for refusing to allow the Nordic country’s main investigator on board a Chinese vessel suspected of severing two cables in the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe Yi Peng 3 sailed away from its mooring in international waters between Denmark and Sweden on Saturday, and appears to be heading for Egypt after Chinese investigators boarded the ship on Thursday.\n\nThe Chinese team had allowed representatives from Sweden, Germany, Finland and Denmark on board as observers, but did not permit access for Henrik Söderman, the Swedish public prosecutor, according to authorities in Stockholm.\n\n“It is something the government inherently takes seriously. It is remarkable that the ship leaves without the prosecutor being given the opportunity to inspect the vessel and question the crew within the framework of a Swedish criminal investigation,” foreign minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said in comments provided to the Financial Times.\n\nThe Swedish government had put pressure on Chinese authorities for the bulk carrier to move from international waters into Swedish territory to allow a full investigation over the severing of Swedish-Lithuanian and Finnish-German data cables last month.\n\nPeople close to the probe said the boarding of the vessel on Thursday had shown there was little doubt it was involved in the incident.\n\n“China’s unwillingness to co-operate on the undersea incident investigations in the Baltic Sea cannot be allowed to set a precedent in Europe — or anywhere else,” said Lithuania’s foreign minister Kęstutis Budrys.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Monday the vessel’s owner had decided to let it resume its voyage out of consideration for the crew’s physical and mental health “after a comprehensive assessment and consultation with relevant parties”.\n\n“China stands ready to maintain communication with relevant countries and continue working together to handle the matters related to the incident,” Mao told a regular news briefing.\n\nYi Peng 3 belongs to Ningbo Yipeng Shipping, a company that owns only one other vessel and is based near the eastern Chinese port city of Ningbo. A representative of Ningbo Yipeng told the FT in November that “the government has asked the company to co-operate with the investigation”, but did not answer further questions.\n\nThere is a split among countries over the motivation behind the cutting of the cables. Some people close to the investigation said they believed it was bad seamanship that may have led to the Yi Peng 3’s anchor dragging along the seabed in the Baltic Sea.\n\nHowever, other governments have said privately that they suspect Russia was behind the damage and may have paid money to the ship’s crew.\n\nThe severing of the two cables was the second time in 13 months that a Chinese ship has damaged infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe Newnew Polar Bear, a Chinese container ship, damaged a gas pipeline in October 2023 by dragging its anchor along the bottom of the Baltic Sea for a considerable distance during a storm. Officials reacted slowly to that incident, allowing the vessel to leave the region without stopping, something that they were keen to prevent in the case of the Yi Peng 3.\n\nNordic and Baltic officials are sceptical about the possibility of the same thing occurring twice in quick succession. “The Chinese must be truly dreadful captains if this keeps on happening innocently,” said one Baltic minister.\n\nAdditional reporting by Edward White",

    "blurb": "Washington needs to move fast if it wants to find other sources",
    "date": "2024-12-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Destructive as it may be, there is a certain symmetry to the latest round of tit-for-tat trade wars. Washington is clamping down further on exports of tools and tech required for cutting-edge semiconductors to China; in response, Beijing is withholding critical minerals and metals used in many of the selfsame military and tech applications.\n\nThis has long been a lever Beijing can pull. China produces 98 per cent of the world’s supply of gallium and 60 per cent of germanium, according to the US Geological Survey. It dominates a host of other so-called rare earth minerals — they are not so much rare as a hassle to extract — used in everything from F-35 fighter jets to night goggles to electric vehicles.\n\nBeijing’s ban, reckon researchers at the USGS, could shave £3.4bn off economic output. That is hardly enough to set Americans quaking; the country generates that in an hour or so; even the modelled worst-case is $9bn. But it may also understate the case. Unlike China, which has accelerated a self-sufficiency drive on chips, corporate America has done little to wean itself off China’s critical minerals.\n\nChina’s no-holds-barred push into the likes of gallium made it financially unviable for bit players to compete. Switching on or adding capacity in mothballed plants in places such as Kazakhstan, Hungary and Germany will not be immediate.\n\nTake-off is proving slow in the US too, even when it comes to releasing gallium — a byproduct — from existing bauxite or zinc smelters. Nyrstar, owned by commodities trading group Trafigura, has yet to progress on a zinc smelter plant in Tennessee, which it reckons could fill 80 per cent of annual US demand for gallium and germanium.\n\nOne answer is more state help or making it more accessible — with a pathway to top-ups if, as is inevitably the case, costs overrun. Australia’s (putative) pioneering rare earth refinery is only just back on the cards after Canberra this month ended a year of wrangling by approving an additional A$400mn of funds, plus potential top-up. The initial A$1.25bn was agreed in 2022.\n\nAn embargo may of course reverse these dynamics, pushing up prices and making the business more profitable: the end-of-year spike is illustrative. Gallium is a byproduct of other processes; plugging in some extra circuitry to capture it without polluting the environment makes sense if prices are higher. This is what Rio Tinto has dubbed “nose to tail mining”.\n\nBut as the Nyrstar and Australian experiences show, none of this happens quickly — and gallium usage is rising. GaN-based semiconductors are faster and more efficient than their silicon peers. Germany’s Infineon recently developed 300mm GaN wafers and sees the GaN market growing to “several billion dollars” by the end of the decade.\n\nIt is perfectly possible for the US to find other sources, by bolting on extra piping to relevant smelters, investing in overseas producers or both. But it needs to move fast.\n\nlouise.lucas@ft.com",

    "body": "China’s short-term sovereign bond yields on Friday dropped to levels last seen during the global financial crisis, as concerns over weak domestic demand bolstered bets that the central bank would further ease monetary policy.\n\nThe yield on one-year bonds fell to 0.92 per cent, marking its lowest level since 2009, while 10-year yields dropped 0.03 percentage points to 1.74 per cent after breaching 2 per cent at the start of the month. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\n\nThe fall in yields comes after the People’s Bank of China announced one-year and five-year loan prime rates would remain unchanged, reinforcing market expectations for further rate cuts in 2025.\n\nThe seven-day reverse repo rate, which the PBoC regards as its main policy tool, currently stands at 1.5 per cent.\n\nThe bond-buying frenzy also follows November data on retail sales that fell short of forecasts, while imports last month fell more than expected, heightening concerns over weak domestic demand.\n\nBut Wei Li, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said that while recent economic data showed domestic consumption still needed a boost, “recent stimulus measures have begun to take effect”.\n\n“Increased demand for treasury bonds from banks and insurance companies at year-end has also contributed to the decline in yields,” he added.\n\nLast week, China loosened its monetary policy stance for the first time in 14 years. It has continued to signal a commitment to boosting the economy and domestic consumption next year, vowing to cut banks’ reserve requirement ratio and interest rates to ensure the market has ample liquidity.\n\nChina’s bond market is seen by many analysts as a battleground for expectations over Chinese economic growth, with policymakers viewing lower yields as a negative signal of market expectations for the economy.\n\nIn its latest attempt to dissuade local financial institutions from piling into government bonds as a haven, which is contributing to driving down yields, the PBoC on Wednesday summoned some banks that it judged to have engaged in “aggressive” trading of sovereign bonds.\n\nThe central bank cautioned them to heed interest rate risks and adopt “prudent” investment behaviour in bonds. It also reiterated its “zero tolerance” towards illegal activities in the bond market, according to Financial News, a PBoC-affiliated publication.\n\nBut according to one institution that received the instructions, the PBoC clarified that it would not interfere with “legitimate” investment activities, a more measured tone than in its earlier warning this year of risks akin to the Silicon Valley Bank collapse.\n\nYields on Chinese sovereign debt across all tenures have declined since the start of the year, as smaller Chinese banks with limited domestic investment options pile into the relatively safe asset.\n\nThe 10-year note yielded 2.56 per cent at the start of the year, while the 30-year note yielded 2.84 per cent.",

    "blurb": "President visits territory to mark 25th anniversary of handover from Portugal",
    "date": "2024-12-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Xi Jinping has called for Macau to prioritise economic diversification as its “first” hope as he wrapped up a three-day tour of the Chinese gambling hub to mark the 25th anniversary of its handover from Portugal.\n\nXi’s remarks on Friday came at the swearing-in ceremony for Macau’s new chief executive Sam Hou-fai, its fourth leader since the 1999 handover.\n\nAnalysts believe Sam, who is the city’s first leader to have been born in mainland China and its first without strong ties to the business sector, will support Beijing’s push for Macau to diversify beyond gambling. The sector, which contributes about 80 per cent of the city’s tax revenue, has made it one of the world’s fastest-growing economies in recent decades.\n\n“First, [Macau] should focus on promoting appropriate economic diversification,” Xi said as he urged Sam’s administration to increase policy support and investment in new industries.\n\nXi also said the “one country, two systems” arrangement — which guided the return of Macau and neighbouring former British territory Hong Kong to Chinese rule — must be upheld “for a long time” to ensure “prosperity and stability” in the city.\n\nChina’s leader, who arrived in Macau on Wednesday, had said he was looking forward to meeting stakeholders from across the city. He also visited the Macau University of Science and Technology, where he was briefed on labs researching traditional Chinese medicine and planetary science and attended a cultural performance at the Macau dome, according to Chinese state media.\n\n“Xi’s visit is significant not just for its symbolism but for its messaging,” said Anthony Lawrance, founder of consultancy Intelligence Macau. “It will be the first time that he heaps praise on Macau for a job well done. His previous trips were to admonish and cajole.”\n\nMacau, the only Chinese territory where gambling is legal, has enjoyed a huge surge of investment since the liberalisation of its gaming monopoly in 2002, including from US-listed casino groups Las Vegas Sands, MGM and Wynn.\n\nBut the city has become reliant on streams of visitors from mainland China. Its economy suffered during the Covid-19 pandemic as strict quarantine and travel rules blocked arrivals.\n\nBeijing also moved in 2022 to crack down on junket operators who offered credit and lavish hospitality packages to attract high-spending Chinese gamblers. Authorities accused them of running huge underground financial mechanisms.\n\nAs a condition for the renewal of their gaming licences last year, Macau’s six major casino operators pledged more than 90 per cent of their roughly $15bn in combined investments over the next decade towards non-gaming enterprises such as conventions, events and exhibitions.\n\n“All of the operators in the industry are redoubling their efforts in diversifying and increasing the non-gaming components of their offering,” Grant Chum, chief executive of Sands China, one of the city’s biggest employers, told the Financial Times this month.\n\nBut analysts said such a shift would be difficult. “Macau faces a number of challenges,” said David Green, founder of Newpage Consulting and a former adviser to the city’s government, citing “a scarcity of human resources, relatively high labour costs and the dominance of the gaming industry”.\n\nBy 9am on Friday, a steady trickle of visitors had arrived at the city’s casinos, but non-gaming offerings, such as a stamps exhibition run in collaboration between MGM China and the Palace Museum in Beijing, went largely ignored.\n\nGuo, a 53-year-old driver from neighbouring Zhuhai city in mainland China, said he had witnessed huge changes since his first trip to Macau in 1979. But, he added as he emerged from the casino at Sands China’s Venetian Macao resort, the official push for diversification had made little difference to him.\n\n“I had a look to see what the luck was like in there,” he said. “Today I won more than HK$500 [US$64], and that’s good enough.”",

    "date": "2024-12-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Welcome to our final Energy Source newsletter until 2025, coming to you today from New York.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday for the third time this year but signalled they might keep borrowing costs higher than expected in 2025.\n\nThe forecast sent renewables stocks tumbling, with the iShares Clean Energy ETF closing 3.2 per cent lower. The renewables sector, which faces high upfront costs, has been battered by elevated borrowing costs and faces an uncertain future next year under incoming US president Donald Trump.In today’s issue we look back on the trends that defined 2024, from stable oil markets, merger and acquisitions in the US, accelerating power demand and the revival of nuclear energy. I hope you all stay safe and enjoy the holiday period. Merry Christmas to all who celebrate and Happy New Year!\n\nThis year we saw the intensification of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, including multiple attacks on critical energy infrastructure in Russia and Ukraine and direct clashes between Iran and Israel that put the Middle East on the brink of an “oil war”.Still, oil markets were relatively stable. According to Deloitte, 2024 was one of the most stable years in the past quarter century for oil markets, with Brent crude, the international benchmark, exhibiting minimal average monthly changes. Prices for Brent settled at $73.39 a barrel yesterday, down 3.3 per cent from $75.89 a barrel on January 2.“This year has been a relatively balanced year on oil supply demand,” said Vikas Dwivedi, an analyst at Macquarie. “I would say probably 70 to 80 per cent of oil price movements are driven by changes in supply . . . this year it’s been way more weighted to demand disappointing.”The reason: excess supply from Opec+ sitting on the sidelines, not to mention the continued growth in production from non-Opec countries such as the US. Slowing demand in China, the cornerstone of oil demand growth, also fundamentally changing the dynamics of the market.\n\nThe slowdown can be partially attributed to the Chinese economy, which remained sluggish this year as it navigated deflationary pressures and a weak property market.\n\nBut analysts say China’s muted thirst for crude points to a larger structural downturn in demand as the energy transition picks up speed. More than half of cars sold in China over the summer were electric, and cheap gas is driving many Chinese truckers to ditch rigs powered by diesel.“It goes deeper on the China side than just the woes of the property sector. Our view is that it’s actually structural. China, probably more so than most other geographies, is successfully transitioning,” said Benjamin Hoff, global head of commodities research at Société Générale.\n\nThis year will go down as the one in which the world woke up to the reality that the transition to a lower carbon and more digital economy will trigger an unprecedented surge in electricity consumption. Power demand accelerated this year with the IEA forecasting consumption to grow by about 4 per cent, up from 2.5 per cent in 2023. The organisation said that global electricity demand was rising at an annual rate of 1,000 terawatt hours, equivalent to adding another Japan to the world’s electricity consumption each year.Strong economic growth and a huge increase in demand for air conditioning as temperatures rise are expected to have a significant impact on the world’s electricity grids in the coming decade, according to the IEA. The proliferation of data centres for artificial intelligence, the onshoring of manufacturing and the adoption of electric vehicles are also expected to drive power consumption.In the US, consultancy Bain warned in October that electricity demand driven by the boom in data centres will outstrip supply later this decade. It forecasts that US utilities will need to boost annual generation by as much as 26 per cent by 2028 from 2023 levels in order to meet rising demand.The looming question is whether this load growth will prompt a retreat in our transition to renewable power and pace of emissions reductions. “All of [a] sudden electric utilities have been deluged with requests of large loads to connect to their electricity system,” said Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie’s vice-chair of energy transition and power and renewables. “It’s clear that it’s not easy to accommodate all of their demand growth with renewables alone.”\n\nThe search for a low-carbon, round-the-clock source of power is heralding a new era for nuclear energy. Big technology companies Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google have all announced investments in nuclear this year as they face mounting pressure to align their surging energy needs with their climate goals. In October, Google ordered six to seven small modular reactors from Kairos Power, becoming the first tech company to commission nuclear power plants to provide energy to data centres. Later that week, Amazon bought a stake in US nuclear developer X-energy to help the company finance the development and licensing of its new generation of SMRs.In perhaps the most tell-tale sign of nuclear’s changing fortunes, Microsoft announced a 20-year power supply deal with Constellation Energy to reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, infamous as the site of the worst nuclear disaster in US history.Despite its newfound popularity, it may take time before nuclear energy makes an impact on US power supply, as the industry faces high building costs and permitting hurdles. SMRs have also yet to be demonstrated at scale, with only four projects under construction globally, according to the World Nuclear Association. David Brown, Wood Mackenzie’s director of energy transition practice, said he expects to see gigawatts of nuclear capacity come online by about 2040 in the US.“These companies need energy now. Nuclear doesn’t solve that problem,” Brown said.“It's a long-term bet on how the tech companies reach sustainability goals and it's a sign of how challenging a 2030 target is for a company or a country because of the load growth and some of the other investment challenges with scaling renewable capacity,” he added.\n\nA wave of dealmaking in the US oil and gas industry continued this year, leaving large publicly listed players in control of the energy landscape.ConocoPhillips acquired Marathon Oil for $22.5bn, deepening one of the world’s biggest independent oil and gas producers’ portfolios that now includes assets stretching from North Dakota to Texas. The deal was Conoco’s biggest since it acquired Concho Resources for $10bn in 2021, and Wood Mackenzie estimated in June that it would give the company an output larger than supermajor TotalEnergies.Other notable deals include Diamondback Energy’s $26bn purchase of Endeavor Energy Resources and Chesapeake Energy’s acquisition of Southwestern Energy for $7.4bn.\n\nWhile mergers and acquisitions have slowed sharply in the second half of the year, Trump’s promises to be friendlier to business and boost drilling could serve as a tailwind for more oil and gas dealmaking, said PwC in its recent outlook. A Republican-led Federal Trade Commission could also be more favourable to oil and gas deals, which have been subjected to scrutiny under current FTC chair Lina Khan.\n\nEnergy Source is written and edited by Jamie Smyth, Myles McCormick, Amanda Chu, Tom Wilson and Malcolm Moore, with support from the FT’s global team of reporters.

    "body": "Hi everyone! Happy upcoming holiday season. This is Cheng Ting-Fang, your #techAsia host for this week.\n\nI recently had a year-end gathering with a friend who has extensive experience in China’s semiconductor industry. He was travelling to Taiwan for business, and we discussed the industry’s chip expansion plans. Despite China’s macroeconomic slowdown, he said he has had a busy year, often travelling to three cities in two days to meet clients eager to buy chipmaking equipment. Notably, he said, not only are there new chipmakers popping up, but makers of silicon wafers and materials as well. Even many Chinese university-led research centres are building clean rooms and offering chip test production services.\n\n“The US has effectively curbed China in advanced chip production with its export controls, but China is rushing to build capacity in places wherever they are not yet restricted, in chips and in related supply chains,” the industry veteran said.\n\nGlobally, the recovery in the chip industry is uneven. Demand for cutting-edge AI chips remains strong, but sectors like consumer electronics and industrial and automotive applications have yet to bounce back completely. Many chipmakers, including Intel, Wolfspeed and Nanya Technology, have slowed their purchases of machines or postponed expansion plans due to the demand slump.\n\nThat makes the scale of expansion in China all the more alarming for the tech community, as it brings to mind past instances where aggressive Chinese expansion in sectors like photovoltaic equipment, LEDs, and displays triggered intense price wars and financial woe for many companies.\n\nNow China is gradually positioning itself to offer more cost-effective solutions in a wide range of electronics components, including chips, chip substrates and printed circuit boards.\n\nIndustry executives liken the intense competition in the Chinese market to a “hotpot with super-thick soup”. The rise of domestic suppliers could impact global supply and demand dynamics, despite the trend of tech decoupling between the US and China. With memories of past financial pain still vivid, the question many executives are asking themselves now is: “Who will be next?”\n\nMore than five years since the US added Huawei to its trade blacklist, where does the Chinese tech champion stand? This exclusive report by Nikkei Asia’s Cheng Ting-Fang, Lauly Li and Shunsuke Tabeta shows how Huawei has become a technology adviser for production partners across China, aggressively helping chip and technology companies enhance their technological prowess.\n\n“If you dig into some chipmakers or tech companies that are now doing more advanced technologies in China, very often people still find shadows of Huawei,” one chip industry executive told Nikkei Asia.\n\nHuawei still leads in R&D efforts and technology developments in China, according to interviews with multiple industry insiders.\n\nOne notable example is SJ Semiconductor, a little-known company located in Jiangyin, along the Yangtze River. Huawei dispatched an elite task force to assist SJ Semiconductor in developing advanced chip packaging capabilities, mirroring TSMC’s CoWoS technology, the industry’s gold standard adopted by Nvidia and Amazon for their latest AI chips.\n\nMore exclusive examples of Huawei’s efforts, as well as visually rich graphics mapping China’s supply chain progress, can be found in this week’s feature. We hope you enjoy it!\n\nTikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew met Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, in Florida, on Monday as the popular video app looks to the president-elect to rescue it from a possible US ban, writes the Financial Times’ Hannah Murphy.\n\nThe ByteDance-owned app will be banned for the company’s 170mn US users if it does not divest from its Chinese parent under a law that comes into force on January 19, the day before Trump’s inauguration as president. TikTok says a divestiture is not technologically feasible. Beijing says it will block such a move.\n\nTikTok has been fighting the law, which cites national security concerns due to the company’s Chinese parent company, in the courts to little success. In recent days, a US appeals court rejected both a challenge to the law and a subsequent request to halt it temporarily. TikTok has now filed a new motion for a temporary stay on the law with the Supreme Court.\n\nIf unsuccessful, Trump is its best hope. Already, he has promised to “save” the app and on Monday said he had a “little bit of a warm spot” for TikTok, citing his overperformance with young voters in November’s election. It is unclear how he might do this - and whether ByteDance or TikTok will make any concessions in order to remain in the US.\n\nAs cars become more interconnected and electrified, automakers will increasingly need to develop in-house chip expertise to differentiate their products, Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi said in an exclusive interview with Cheng Ting-Fang of Nikkei Asia.\n\nThe CEO said this applies to companies developing automation solutions and robots, as well, emphasising that the integration of software and specialised chips will be crucial to creating products that stand out from competitors.\n\nSynopsys, the world’s leading provider of electronic design automation (EDA) software, spotted this trend and now makes some 45 per cent of its revenue from “system” companies, as opposed to pure chip developers, as in the past. As electronic systems become increasingly sophisticated, Synopsys expects the importance of EDA tools will only grow.\n\nJapan’s top memory chipmaker Kioxia, a leading provider of NAND flash memory, debuted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Wednesday, with shares ending the day 16.9 per cent higher. The IPO marks a milestone for the company, which was carved out from Toshiba in 2018, as it aims to accelerate its tech development and capture the growth in the AI era, Mitsuru Obe of Nikkei Asia writes.\n\nThe IPO also came as Japan aims to revive its semiconductor industry and boost the onshore production of vital chips. NAND flash memory, a type of data storage component, is needed for all electronic devices. The market, however, is still soft due to global economic factors and competition from major players such as Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, as well as emerging players in China. Against this backdrop, Kioxia’s market capitalisation of around ¥863bn ($5.6bn) at the close of its first trading day was well below its ¥2tn valuation when, as Toshiba Memory, it was acquired by a Bain Capital-led consortium in 2018.",

If convicted, Sadler and La Rocca could face a maximum prison sentence of seven years.\n\nDistrict judge Kwok Wai-kin set the trial date for May 4 2026, allocating 25 days for proceedings. A pretrial review hearing is expected to be held on December 4 2025.\n\nA lawyer for the prosecution said there were four prosecution witnesses expected, including one market expert. Sadler and La Rocca did not speak during the hearing.\n\nThe judge also extended the defendants’ bail until the December hearing.\n\nSadler, 55, who is from Blackpool in north-west England, founded Segantii in 2007 and built it into one of Asia’s most well-known hedge funds, with $6bn under management at its peak. He is the owner of Blackpool Football Club, which he bought in 2019.\n\nThe fund has started winding down operations and returning capital to investors after Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission announced its criminal investigation in May.\n\nSegantii was one of the most powerful participants in the market for block trades, a lucrative corner of finance in which banks arrange to offload large chunks of shares privately. Such sales can depress a company’s stock price.\n\nThe hedge fund was a prolific buyer of blocks and had built strong relationships with Wall Street’s biggest banks. But in 2022, the Financial Times reported that Bank of America and Citigroup had suspended equity trading with Segantii due to concerns about its bets on block sales.\n\nSegantii has previously said it “intends to defend itself vigorously against the charge”.",

    "body": "As precious gifts go, olive oil, gallium and container ships don’t quite hold the same festive symbolism as gold, frankincense and myrrh. Yet as Christmas approaches, let us appreciate the true magi of globalisation in 2024: consumer rights activists from Spain, mineral dealers from Japan and shipbuilders from China.\n\nThe year has seen the usual stream of warnings that trade is about to collapse. There are fewer follow-up stories detailing how systems coped, how markets reacted and how problems moderated or disappeared. I may repeatedly harp on this particular theme but someone has to be a counterweight to the catastrophising about globalisation, and it turns out it’s me.\n\nSo let’s have a look at the crises that didn’t happen or eased this year. First up are the sharp increases in global olive oil prices, which more than doubled between mid-2022 and mid-2023, after droughts in Europe. Spain, the world’s largest exporter and one of its biggest consumers of olive oil, where it goes by the name of oro líquido (liquid gold), was understandably distressed.\n\nWhat happened? Imports to Spain from Tunisia increased. Households modified their habits, switching from more expensive virgin to less expensive non-virgin blended types, or to sunflower oil. The consumer group FACUA put pressure on supermarkets by running a daily price comparator. Mercadona, the bellwether supermarket chain, repeatedly cut prices from July despite global markets remaining tight. A litre of its standard oil has now fallen from €8 to less than €6. The government helped by cutting VAT on olive oil sales.\n\nFood costs pushed Spanish consumer price inflation higher than in some other European countries, but it’s a rich country and dearer oil did not exactly throw millions of households into abject poverty. Olive oil production is recovering from the drought and is expected to increase by a third in the 2024-25 harvest. By all accounts Spanish cuisine has, happily, survived.\n\nOf course, climate change threatens crop production worldwide. It’s a colossal failure by humanity not to have addressed it. But its effects are mitigated by open markets and smart scientists. The threat of a global food crisis after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 receded further this year, thanks to more bounteous harvests. Crop scientists and innovative agriculture have delivered consistently rising yields.\n\nSo, what other catastrophes were avoided? Last year ended with trade economists frantically googling “Houthi” to discover exactly who had bunged up the Suez Canal and driven up freight rates. As of this week, according to the specialist news service TradeWinds, the Houthis are reportedly considering running seminars on shipping security — astonishing brass neck if true.\n\nMore importantly, having initially fallen back early in the year, freight costs then shot higher again in the summer. The increase triggered a fresh round of the kind of warnings last seen in the Covid days of 2021 and 2022 that global shipping would permanently be affected. In the event, shipping industry experts say, it turned out to be a one-off burst of companies rebuilding inventories. Freight rates have fallen since, despite the global volume of containers being carried increasing.\n\nThe shipping industry is bracing itself for the possibility of a big reduction in China-US traffic if president-elect Donald Trump imposes high tariffs on imports from China. But the experience of his first term was those imports being replaced by goods from south-east Asian countries such as Vietnam, often adding another stage in the value chain. Shipping lines would have to adjust their routes, originating more journeys in Vietnam, but that’s a question of redirecting the same ships, not a fundamental rewiring of global trade. In any case, a stream of container vessels ordered in recent years, mainly from Chinese shipyards, has started to come into service.\n\nFinally, another chapter of a long-running saga was written in 2024 by more announcements of restrictions on critical minerals, apparently designed to hobble strategic rivals by depriving their industries of key inputs. Two weeks ago, China said it was banning exports of antimony, germanium and gallium to the US, tightening up on restrictions it imposed last year.\n\nThe problem with this as a threat is that, according to customs data, the US has this year already essentially stopped importing germanium and gallium from China. And yet the American semiconductor producers that use the minerals haven’t noticeably ground to a halt. China continues to export to other countries, notably including Germany and Japan, suggesting that gallium ends up in the US via one route or another.\n\nIn any case, germanium and gallium aren’t uniquely found in nature in China: they’re extracted from zinc and aluminium ores. If prices are high enough, supply will come. The mining company Rio Tinto is looking to set up gallium production in Canada.\n\nThere will no doubt be more globalisation scares next year, some of them well founded. Of course Trump’s accession to the White House massively increases the genuine threat from governments’ interference in the trading system. But the countervailing forces remain, having had another good year. High prices induce more supply. Blocks on trade spur the creation of new routes. Consumers in high-income countries can absorb shocks. Flexible economies can adjust. All is not lost, and Christmas is coming up. God bless us, every one.\n\nalan.beattie@ft.com",

    "body": "Economists are warning that China’s export growth could weaken or even contract next year as a result of Donald Trump’s tariffs, as the incoming US administration threatens to hamstring a crucial source of expansion for Beijing.\n\nChinese exports have risen about 5.4 per cent in dollar terms from January to November year on year to $3.2tn, bolstering overall GDP growth at a time when authorities have struggled to restore confidence during a drawn-out property slowdown.\n\nBut economists widely anticipate a deceleration in 2025 because of the tariffs, which many say will increase the need for Beijing to strengthen support for the economy.\n\nExports “were a big part of economic growth in 2024,” said Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley. “I think that contribution will definitely narrow.”\n\nTrump last month pledged to raise tariffs on Chinese goods by 10 per cent — compared with earlier threats of 60 per cent — though no official decision has been made ahead of his inauguration in January.\n\nWhile forecasts of their potential impact vary, Goldman Sachs expects Chinese exports to decline 0.9 per cent in US dollar terms next year. Capital Economics also forecasts an outright decline, while UBS and Nomura have projected zero growth in exports.\n\nOther banks, including Morgan Stanley and ING, show exports still rising, but at a much slower rate than in 2024.\n\nA poll of economists published last week by survey firm FocusEconomics estimated Chinese merchandise export growth of just 2 per cent in 2025, sharply down from the 3.9 per cent growth forecast a month earlier.\n\nDiminishing export growth would come at a critical moment for the Chinese economy. President Xi Jinping shifted emphasis towards domestic demand at an annual Central Economic Work Conference last week, in a sign of renewed urgency to boost growth.\n\nEconomic data on Monday showed unexpected weakness in retail sales, adding to pressure on policymakers. Beijing already introduced measures in late September to support stock market prices and a local government refinancing package last month.\n\nXing of Morgan Stanley warned that slowing export growth was “going to make China’s deflation problem even worse”.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday that the external environment had become “more complex”.\n\nTing Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said the tariffs could start affecting China’s exports from mid-2025 and anticipated that front-loading shipments in the fourth quarter would also weigh on growth. In the absence of obstacles such as tariffs, he projected export growth of 4-5 per cent.\n\nJulian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, suggested large-scale tariffs would not be introduced until the second quarter. He said exports would remain “healthy” until then, but anticipates a sharper decline of 3.5 per cent in 2026.\n\nBeijing is under pressure to reach its official annual economic growth target of about 5 per cent, which Xi said this month he was “fully confident” of reaching.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimated that exports will ultimately contribute nearly three-quarters of overall GDP growth in 2024, which they forecast at 4.9 per cent. They expect that figure to fall to 4.5 per cent next year as a result of a loss of export growth.\n\nEconomists have based their estimates for export and GDP growth on a range of tariff scenarios. For example, Barclays expects a 0.8-1 percentage point GDP hit from trade tensions, assuming tariffs of 30 per cent.\n\nUnder 60 per cent tariffs, Macquarie said China’s total exports would fall 8 per cent, GDP would decline 2 percentage points and Beijing would have “no choice but to escalate stimulus”.\n\nBut Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, said it was “almost impossible” to forecast exports given uncertainties over the “size, timing and implementation of the tariffs”.\n\nAdditional reporting by Haohsiang Ko in Hong Kong",

    "body": "Rachel Reeves will next month head a delegation of leading bankers to Beijing to seek closer ties across a range of financial services, while quietly sidelining security fears over the UK-China relationship.\n\nThe chancellor has been leading opposition to China’s inclusion in the “enhanced tier” of a new scheme that would force companies acting for foreign entities to flag their work on a central register, according to government officials.\n\nShe fears that including Chinese nationals in the scheme — which is intended to allow the UK to monitor potential foreign influence — would hobble business ties with the People’s Republic.\n\nA scandal over alleged Chinese spying at the heart of the British establishment this week has complicated Reeves’ visit in January.\n\nThe chancellor will be accompanied by City minister Tulip Siddiq and leading financial figures on the trip, which is expected to relaunch the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue, last held in 2019.\n\nThe talks will cover issues such as co-operation in capital markets, increased connectivity between financial markets and bond markets, co-operation on regulation, and clean energy, according to people briefed on the agenda.\n\nYet leading Conservatives said this week’s spy scandal showed that Britain should take a much tougher line with Beijing.\n\nTom Tugendhat, former Conservative security minister, said it was crucial that China was placed on the “enhanced tier” of the new “foreign influence registration scheme”, which he devised.\n\nThe scheme is a two-tier programme that will force companies acting in certain capacities for foreign powers or entities to flag that activity on a central register. It is aimed at bolstering the UK government’s understanding of the nature and extent of foreign influence domestically.\n\nLoosely modelled on the US Foreign Agents Registration Act, the scheme was first proposed by Rishi Sunak with a view to it becoming active this autumn.\n\nBut it has been delayed since Labour entered office, as Sir Keir Starmer has grappled with the same debate that beset his Tory predecessors: whether to include China in the more stringent level.\n\nTugendhat said this week the advice from MI5 had been “very, very clear” that the scheme would “not be worth having” if Beijing was not in an enhanced tier, which requires extra scrutiny of some foreign nationals.\n\nReeves and Jonathan Reynolds, business secretary, are among those opposed to including China, according to government officials. “It would have a clear impact on the financial services sector,” said one.\n\nReeves said on Monday that Britain would take a “pragmatic” approach to relations with China and that national security would be the top priority — but added that commercial considerations were vital too.\n\n“Like other countries around the world, we should trade and seek investment when it is in our national interest to do so, and that will be the approach of this government,” she said.\n\nCity of London lobbyists decline to speak publicly for fear of inflaming the issue, but argue the scheme will complicate business with China and create a more onerous regime than that seen in competitor countries.\n\nOne said: “It would capture a lot of day-to-day business. There hasn’t really been any consultation. North Korea or Iran [who are both on the higher tier] are very different to China, given the level of commercial interaction.”\n\nReeves’ Beijing talks will focus on financial services. According to a document first reported by Bloomberg News, they will include discussion of a resumption of the London-Shanghai Stock Connect — to allow dual listings — first proposed in 2015 and halted in 2020.\n\nThe discussions will also consider improving the regulatory environment for financial tech firms and deeper co-operation between UK and Chinese asset management firms. The Treasury declined to comment.",

    "body": "China has increased its arsenal of operational nuclear warheads to 600 from 500 in just a year, as the People’s Liberation Army continues a rapid expansion of its forces, according to the US defence department.\n\nIn its annual “China Military Power Report”, the Pentagon said the PLA had expanded its arsenal by 20 per cent in the 12 months from mid-2023 and was on track to have 1,000 operational warheads by 2030.\n\nThe Pentagon has in recent years warned that the US will soon face two nuclear peers as China’s arsenal grows closer in size to the US and Russia.\n\nChina has not denied increasing the size of its nuclear forces but dismisses US concern about the issue, saying Washington uses it as a pretext for its pursuit of “absolute strategic predominance”.\n\nThe Pentagon report estimated that China would continue to increase its nuclear forces until at least 2035. But it did not repeat its 2022 projection that the PLA was on track to have 1,500 warheads by the middle of the next decade, a figure that would nearly match the number deployed by the US and Russia.\n\nA US defence official said the Pentagon was being cautious with its latest forecast.\n\n“The further out we go . . . the more challenging it is to have a projection that you can have great confidence in, because there are so many variables that could cause them to adjust either what they think is necessary or what they’re able to do,” he said.\n\nThe report said the PLA Rocket Force, which manages most of China’s nuclear arsenal, was developing new intercontinental ballistic missiles that would significantly improve its nuclear-capable forces.\n\nThe report, which is mandated by Congress, comes as president-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January. Defence experts are waiting to see what approach he will take on China and Taiwan.\n\nUS officials believe President Xi Jinping has ordered the Chinese military to develop the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027, the centennial of the PLA’s founding. The defence official stressed the Pentagon did not believe an attack on Taiwan was “imminent or inevitable” and said the US had “deterrence today that’s real and strong”.\n\nThe report said the PLA had made “uneven progress” towards its modernisation goal for 2027.\n\nThe report said the PLA was experiencing a new “wave” of corruption in its senior ranks that “may have disrupted” progress towards the 2027 milestone. “It may have shaken Beijing’s confidence in high-ranking PLA officials,” it concluded.\n\nThe Chinese defence ministry last month said Miao Hua, one of the top five military officers who command the PLA, had been placed under investigation for “serious violations of discipline”.\n\nThe Financial Times reported last month that some US officials believe Chinese defence minister Dong Jun is also under investigation. The US official said he could not confirm or deny if Dong was being probed. Beijing has dismissed the claim. Dong’s two predecessors — Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu — have both been placed under investigation for corruption.\n\nThe Pentagon official said that in the second half of 2023 alone China removed at least 15 high-level military officials and defence industry executives, including the head of the PLA Rocket Force.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in August that Beijing’s nuclear strategy focused on self-defence, that it always kept its nuclear capabilities at the “minimum level required by national security”.\n\n“It is the US who is the primary source of nuclear threats and strategic risks in the world,” Mao said.",

    "date": "2024-12-1800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Tengbo Yang, a Chinese man who became a confidant of the UK’s Prince Andrew, allegedly worked for a senior part of China’s hierarchy that Beijing calls “its magic weapon”. But this week in London, that weapon spectacularly backfired.\n\nWhile the United Front Work Department, where UK intelligence agency MI5 alleges Yang worked, is regarded by Beijing as officially distinct from its espionage agencies, its overseas operations aim to win influence for China by using various methods — some open, some shadowy — to befriend and inveigle senior figures to serve its cause, analysts say.\n\nYang, a 50-year-old Chinese national banned from entering the UK on security grounds, was publicly named on Tuesday after a British judge lifted an anonymity order.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, Christine Lee, a lawyer who was accused by MI5 of “political interference” in 2022, lost a legal challenge against the security services. Lee had made a large donation to Labour MP Barry Gardiner.\n\n“Prince Andrew, Christine Lee and Barry Gardiner have done more in five days to push the issue of Chinese influence up the political agenda than MPs, the media and others have managed in five years,” said Charles Parton, a fellow at the Council on Geostrategy think-tank and a former UK diplomat in China.\n\n“Useful idiots? You bet,” Parton added.\n\nAlleged Chinese political influence cases touching the upper reaches of UK life have raised a set of uncomfortable questions for Sir Keir Starmer’s government, which is hoping to strengthen ties with China to boost economic growth and address common issues such as climate change.\n\nChina’s embassy in London warned the UK on Tuesday to “stop creating trouble”, and hit out at MPs’ “twisted mentality” over Yang’s case, which alleges that he developed business links with Prince Andrew and access to a network of other senior British and business figures.\n\nAn embassy spokesperson described the United Front as “beyond reproach” and a means to “promote . . . friendship with other countries”, and accused UK lawmakers of “arrogance and shamelessness”.\n\nThe United Front has long been known to operate overseas in the UK, US, and other western countries, but the organisation has a diverse agenda and thousands of people on its payroll, according to analysts. In addition to influencing foreign figures and the Chinese diaspora, it also conducts a vast set of domestic operations, including the “Sinicisation” of oppressed ethnic minority groups in Tibet and Xinjiang.\n\nThe organisation’s ultimate head is Wang Huning, Xi Jinping’s chief ideologue and propagandist who is a member of the seven-member ruling Politburo Standing Committee, the Chinese Communist party’s peak leadership body.\n\nWang also leads the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Beijing’s advisory body, which meets annually alongside the country’s rubber-stamp parliament. Analysts view the CPPCC as a paramount United Front organisation, bringing together important representatives of organisations and companies from inside and outside the party.\n\n“It is crucial to ensure that the overall leadership of the Communist Party of China . . . is enhanced across all aspects and at every stage of United Front work,” Wang Huning told a United Front work conference in southern China in January.\n\nYang was an overseas delegate of the CPPCC and was featured in state media interviews, highlighting the significance of his work in the UK in Chinese propaganda.\n\nWhile the United Front’s central mission is “to unite all forces that can be united” under the Communist party’s will and neutralise or weaken those that cannot be won over, Beijing views the organisation as distinct from China’s espionage agencies, such as the Ministry of State Security, whose operations in China and abroad are largely secret.\n\nIn addition to the MSS, China’s Ministry of Public Security and military also conduct secret intelligence operations.\n\nOne sensitive area of United Front operations overseas is students. According to research last year by the Henry Jackson Society, a think-tank, there are more than 90 Chinese Students and Scholars Associations in the UK, which draw membership from among the roughly 150,000 mainland Chinese students at British universities.\n\nBut the report argued that CSSA were far from normal student societies. “The reality is that CSSAs are branches of a central CSSAUK, which is overseen by Chinese diplomats in the UK, and part of the United Front Work system of China,” it said.\n\nIndeed, the report argued that the real role of CSSAs in the UK and in other countries was to challenge mainland Chinese students who hold views that dissent from Beijing’s orthodoxies, particularly over tensions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.\n\n“In the UK, individuals and organisations with clear and concrete links to the [UFWD] have been involved in technology transfer efforts, community surveillance, political influence and propaganda,” said Sam Dunning, director at UK-China Transparency, a campaign group.\n\nBut the amorphous nature of the United Front creates space for deniability while it also casts suspicion on those who have contact with the organisation, no matter how tenuous those links may be.\n\nSeveral current and former Chinese students in the UK told the Financial Times that by no means all members of CSSAs were actively involved in the United Front. “Only a small minority of students seemed to be interested,” said one former student at a top UK university, adding that it was “very easy to avoid the CSSAs’ attention”.\n\nThis obscurity in the United Front’s operations was also evident in some of the statements by the UK commission that ruled on Yang’s case.\n\nIt found that Yang “had been in a position to generate relationships with prominent UK figures and senior Chinese officials that could be leveraged for political interference purposes by the CCP . . . or the Chinese State”.\n\nThe judges further found there was “not an abundance of evidence of the UFWD links”, but noted an inconsistency between some of the evidence and Yang’s “claims that he had no connections to anyone in politics in China”.\n\nIn a statement this week, Yang did not directly refer to the United Front but insisted he had done “nothing wrong or unlawful” and that the concerns raised by the Home Office were “ill-founded”.\n\n“The widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue,” he said.",

    "date": "2024-12-1800:00:00.0",
    "body": "AstraZeneca’s sales in China have been hit by the arrest of its country head, say company insiders, as local hospitals shun purchasing drugs from the company.\n\nExecutives at the British pharmaceutical company expect to see an “evident” revenue hit in China in the wake of the arrest of its country president Leon Wang and several other senior executives, according to two people familiar with the matter. Sales of oncology products in particular — at the heart of Chinese authorities’ investigations — have been affected, the insiders said.\n\nAstraZeneca declined to comment on the ongoing investigations, or to what extent they would affect its top line.\n\nThe detention of China’s most prominent pharmaceutical executive has sent shockwaves through the industry. Wang’s arrest came after scores of senior hospital officials were detained as part of a wider anti-corruption campaign that Beijing says is targeting the egregious costs of medical care.\n\nWang’s arrest represents a dramatic reversal of fortunes for AstraZeneca in China, where it is the largest foreign drugmaker by sales. Wang had been celebrated by state media for his contributions to bolstering the domestic pharmaceutical and biotech sectors through start-up investments and building manufacturing capacity and research facilities.\n\nIt is unclear at this stage how big a sales hit AstraZeneca will take, with the numbers coming in the company’s next financial report. But one executive told the Financial Times: “The sales impact is already very evident.”\n\nAstraZeneca made $5.9bn in sales in China in 2023, 13 per cent of its total. Last month, it increased its full-year guidance for worldwide revenue and earnings growth.\n\n“Doctors are unwilling to interact with our salespeople and prescribe our medicines. They will say our company has had too many issues and will opt for other choices, particularly Chinese-made drugs,” the AstraZeneca executive added.\n\nThere are early signs that cancer drugs Tagrisso and Imfinzi have been particularly severely affected, they said. The company hopes that Enhertu sales could weather the crisis, according to one of the people familiar with its position, as it is considered the best drug on the market for certain types of breast cancer.\n\nIn recent financial reports, AstraZeneca has cited “strong uptake in China” following Enhertu’s commercial launch at the start of the year. Chinese authorities announced in late November — after Wang’s detention — that the drug would be included in the state health insurance scheme.\n\nWang’s arrest caught AstraZeneca off guard. The UK leadership initially blamed the scandal on low-level employees in China, following news reports that several salespeople had been arrested for illegally importing cancer drug Imjudo.\n\nChief executive Sir Pascal Soriot, in an interview with Bloomberg News in September, said it only affected a “small number of employees” and that the company has “strong compliance policies”.\n\nBut then, in late October, Wang was arrested, as authorities started probing how much senior management knew about alleged wrongdoings about its sales practices.\n\n“At first, Soriot thought it was just a few salespeople gone rogue out of several thousand. But he realised it was more complicated than that when Leon was detained,” said one person close to the chief executive.\n\nAstraZeneca leadership has received no formal explanation from Chinese authorities and has not been able to contact Wang, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has concluded that the probe is about Imjudo sales in China — where the drug is not approved — because authorities also detained AstraZeneca’s former head of oncology, Yin Min, who was in charge of the department during the alleged offences.\n\n“We haven’t received any explanation. We can only guess that it is related to Imjudo because of the other people who have been implicated,” said one person.\n\nSeparately, AstraZeneca has also faced a public relations crisis after scores of salespeople were convicted over the past two years for medical insurance fraud. The courts found that they tampered with genetic test results to ensure lung cancer patients qualify for Tagrisso under a national insurance reimbursement scheme.\n\nShares in AstraZeneca are down more than 8 per cent since the company disclosed Wang’s detention in late October.\n\nEmily Field, an analyst at Barclays, said investors were particularly shaken because they had known Wang, who participated in earnings calls. But now she believes there is consensus that there was an overreaction. “No one thinks AstraZeneca is going to get kicked out of China. Maybe they get a fine in the low-to-mid single-digit billions of dollars,” she said.\n\nRival FTSE 100 group GSK was fined £297mn by the Chinese authorities in 2014 after a bribery scandal.\n\nAstraZeneca has appointed Iskra Reic to manage the China business through the crisis, who is seen by Pascal as a “troubleshooter”. When she ran Europe for AstraZeneca, she had to deal with a disgruntled EU over vaccine manufacturing problems during the Covid-19 crisis. Soriot sees her as someone he can trust and hopefully a “fresh face” in China, said the person close to the chief executive.\n\nBut company insiders in China have cast doubt on the ability of a foreign executive to navigate the political sensitivities during a period when the company is under such intense scrutiny from authorities.\n\nCompany insiders are concerned about whether it can return to business as usual. One said: “It is very difficult to see a way out of this for AstraZeneca.”",

    "body": "At Huawei’s electric vehicle division a giant screen highlights two of the biggest changes in human mobility in the past 150 years: from horses to cars, and from the internal combustion engine to driverless EVs.\n\nHuawei was not around for that first automotive revolution, but despite being heavily targeted by US sanctions, the Chinese tech powerhouse is determined not to be excluded from the second.\n\nThe world’s biggest telecoms group and one of the biggest smartphone producers believes it can capture lucrative segments of the car industry as it is transformed by automation and electrification.\n\nIts aspirations run from providing carmakers with hardware including telecoms gear, screens and infotainment systems, all the way to developing software for advanced driverless car systems and computer chips — but it has no plans to build cars itself.\n\n“No matter how good Huawei’s cars were, at best they would be like mobile phones, accounting for 10 to 20 per cent of the market,” current chair Xu Zhijun told Chinese state media in a recent interview.\n\nInstead, said Xu, Huawei’s automotive ambitions were to be the “Chinese version of Bosch”, referring to the German industrial giant that generated revenues of more than $50bn from its Mobility parts and services unit last year.\n\nThe Financial Times was able to visit Huawei in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, but the company declined on-the-record interviews.\n\nHuawei’s entrance into the automotive market comes as China’s dominance of the resources, manufacturing and technology used to make EVs transforms an industry dominated for decades by companies from the US, Europe and more recently, Japan and South Korea.\n\nNissan and Honda are in exploratory talks about a merger, the latest sign of the threat to traditional carmakers from fast-growing Chinese manufacturers.\n\nVincent Sun, an equity analyst covering China’s car sector for investment research group Morningstar, said Huawei’s telecommunications, chip design and smartphone businesses had “a lot of synergies” with the technology underpinning increasingly advanced cars.\n\n“Huawei is a different animal,” said Sun, adding that traditional car companies needed to boost research and development spending to avoid becoming obsolete “like Nokia”, referring to the Finnish phonemaker’s failure to adapt to the smartphone era.\n\nAs the EV transition gathers pace, global service revenues from robotaxis alone are forecast to reach as high as $1.2tn annually, according to IDTechEx, a UK research group.\n\nHowever, Huawei’s EV foray also raises questions over how foreign markets will treat the company led by founder Ren Zhengfei, a former People’s Liberation Army engineer.\n\nFor years the company has been at the heart of US-China tensions amid accusations from Washington of national security risks stemming from alleged state and military links. Its global ambitions have been hammered by US-led restrictions on its telecoms sales and its access to cutting-edge chip technology.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, who is president-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, alleged in October that one of Huawei’s “primary goals” was expanding the Chinese Communist party’s ability to spy on and disrupt other countries’ communications.\n\nHuawei has spent five years and at least $5.6bn on research and development linked to EVs, part of a search for new growth drivers. Executives believe Huawei is poised to leverage dozens of Chinese technologies, from chips, radars and cameras to artificial intelligence, data centres, autonomous driving and infotainment systems.\n\nThe group reported revenues of Rmb4.7bn ($655mn) from its nascent automotive business unit last year, more than double those of the previous year but less than 1 per cent of the group’s total of Rmb704bn.\n\nIn January, the privately owned company moved to separate its EV business, registering a new entity, Yinwang, for marketing its main EV-focused systems and components, including its autonomous driving software.\n\nHuawei has since sold two 10 per cent stakes in the company — to Avatr Technology, an EV start-up owned by state-backed Changan Automobile and the world’s biggest battery maker CATL, and to Chongqing-based carmaker Seres.\n\nThe deals valued Yinwang at $16bn, not far behind the market capitalisation of the listed unit of Geely, one of China’s biggest private-sector carmakers. And Huawei remains on the lookout for new strategic investors.\n\nThe group has established partnerships with a clutch of traditional Chinese carmakers, such as state-backed groups Chery, Seres, BAIC and JAC, and has been closely involved in car development and sales, including leveraging its massive retail network.\n\nFor the legacy Chinese brands, the Huawei tie-ups are a lifeline to transition to EVs following years of declining sales and massive overcapacity in petrol-powered cars.\n\nHuawei has also clinched narrower but possibly more important deals, supplying software and hardware solutions. This includes selling its advanced autonomous driving system for some models made by BYD, the Warren Buffett-backed group that is challenging Tesla as the world’s biggest EV maker.\n\nDespite the geopolitical backdrop, foreign companies in Chinese joint ventures, including Germany’s Audi and Japan’s Toyota and Nissan, are also collaborating with Huawei on advanced driving technology as they try to survive the onslaught from Chinese competition.\n\nBill Russo, the former head of Chrysler in China and founder of the consultancy Automobility, said Huawei was among a group of Chinese internet giants and device makers — which also includes Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi — unlocking new and “recurring” revenue streams linked to EVs.\n\nIn the first 10 months of this year, sales of models jointly developed by Huawei and its four main partners — Chery, Seres, BAIC and JAC — have totalled 353,600, according to data supplied to the FT. A fifth partner, state-backed GAC, was announced in late November.\n\nSales have been dominated by Aito cars, made by the Seres-Huawei venture, which have captured nearly 4 per cent of the market for battery and plug-in hybrid EVs. By comparison, Tesla had 6 per cent of the EV market with just over 500,000 cars and BYD had 35 per cent with 2.9mn.\n\nHuawei is also targeting growth through the surge in automation in commercial vehicles for use in mines, ports and other logistics hubs. The group is touting its ability to link transport and logistics fleets to its global data centres.\n\nChristoph Weber, who leads the China business for Swiss engineering software group AutoForm, said Huawei had demonstrated how tech groups with little experience in the car industry could rapidly grow market share and pose an existential threat to incumbents.\n\n“Clearly, the tech and automotive industries are merging,” he said. “It puts everyone else under even more pressure.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Harry Dempsey in Tokyo",

    "body": "Taiwan’s government is in talks with Amazon’s Project Kuiper subsidiary about co-operating on satellite-based communications, as Taipei broadens its efforts to make its mobile phone and internet infrastructure less vulnerable to a potential Chinese attack.\n\nWu Cheng-wen, technology minister, told foreign media on Tuesday that the OneWeb network of French satellite operator Eutelsat, which partnered with Taiwan’s state-backed Chunghwa Telecom last year, was falling short in providing sufficient capacity for the country’s needs.\n\nTaipei was now exploring additional international collaboration, Wu said.\n\n“We found that their bandwidth is too small for real applications,” the minister said about OneWeb. “So far as I know, the company is in financial problems at this moment, so they have a [delay] in developing the second generation satellites.\n\n“There are other companies in the Western world, including some from Europe and from North America and Canada, but Amazon Kuiper is the most mature in their development stage so far. So we are discussing with them at this moment if it is possible that we will have a collaboration in the future,” he added.\n\nAsked about Wu’s comments, Eutelsat OneWeb said it was “absolutely not in financial difficulties” and that there was “no delay” in developing the next generation of its constellation, which was progressing as planned.\n\nOneWeb and Kuiper are among the largest of numerous nascent providers of communications services offering or planning networks of satellites in low Earth orbit — the region of space up to about 2,000km above the planet’s surface — in competition to Elon Musk’s Starlink.\n\nKuiper plans to begin launching its constellation soon, with services from low Earth orbit expected to begin next year.\n\nEutelsat OneWeb said it was the only LEO network “ready to deliver services in Taiwan” and that it had “the full backing of our shareholders” for its new constellation.\n\nAfter Russia launched its full invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Taiwan cranked up efforts to become more resilient against what it fears is a growing risk of Chinese aggression. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and threatens to annex it if Taipei refuses to submit to its control indefinitely.\n\nThe role that Starlink has played in upholding Ukraine’s wartime communications drove the Taiwanese government to pursue LEO communications as a back-up, in case the undersea cables that support its mobile telephony and internet systems are cut.\n\nTaiwanese government officials said separately that Starlink itself was not an option for them, adding Musk’s company would not agree to a joint venture in which Chunghwa Telecom or another Taiwanese entity held at least 50 per cent, as Taipei demands.\n\nOfficials said Musk’s extensive business interests in China and past comments on Taiwan’s political status and future were an additional hurdle.\n\nMusk has repeatedly suggested he takes China’s side in the sovereignty dispute. Last year, he said Taiwan was an integral part of China as claimed by Beijing, adding that it was “arbitrarily” outside Beijing’s control because the US military was blocking unification.\n\nTwo years ago, he suggested the conflict be resolved by handing at least partial control of Taiwan to China.\n\nApart from Chunghwa Telecom’s tie-up with OneWeb, Taiwan’s space agency is also working to develop a national provider with its own low Earth orbit satellite constellation.\n\nWu said the government aimed to pick a site in south-eastern Taiwan for launching its own rockets, with launches expected to start within five years.\n\nEutelsat is highly leveraged, with net debt in September totalling four times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Earlier this year, the group was forced to cut revenue guidance for 2024 and 2025 because of uncertainty over the outlook for OneWeb.\n\nAmazon and SpaceX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Yasemin Craggs Mersinoglu in London",

    "body": "China’s embassy in London has warned the UK to “stop creating trouble” as it hit out at MPs’ “twisted mentality” over allegations that a Chinese businessman linked to Prince Andrew is a Communist party spy.\n\nAn embassy spokesperson also accused UK lawmakers of “arrogance and shamelessness” over the claims.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “We urge the UK side to immediately stop creating trouble, stop anti-China political manipulations, and stop undermining normal personnel exchange between China and the US.”\n\nTuesday’s comments came after a judge allowed the 50-year-old Chinese national, who has been banned from Britain on national security grounds, to be identified as Tengbo Yang.\n\nDan Jarvis, UK security minister, welcomed the court’s decision to uphold the ban on Yang and warned “this case does not exist in a vacuum”.\n\nHe told MPs that Britain faced “ongoing efforts by a number of states, including China, Russia and Iran, to harm the UK’s security”.\n\nYang’s anonymity order was reviewed during a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice on Monday, as MPs were threatening to use parliamentary privilege to name Yang in the House of Commons.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Chinese spokesperson labelled “the anti-China clamours made by a handful of UK MPs” as a push “to smear China [and] target against the Chinese community in the UK”.\n\n“We strongly condemn this,” the spokesperson added.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, a lawyer whom MI5 accused of “political interference” on behalf of the Chinese Communist party lost a key legal challenge against the security services.\n\nChristine Lee, who set up an all-party parliamentary group “Chinese in Britain” and donated more than £420,000 to Labour MP Barry Gardiner, was the subject of an “interference alert” in 2022 that acts as a warning to anyone engaging with her.\n\nInterference is separate to espionage, which involves collecting information.\n\nLee’s lawyers had argued to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a body that oversees the UK’s security services, that the alert made to parliament was unlawful and politically motivated.\n\nLord Justice Singh dismissed the case, saying the risk Lee posed had been “rationally assessed” by MI5 in line with its remit, and the alert was intended to be “preventive”.\n\nHe added there had not been an “authoritative finding” that Lee had been engaged in criminal activity or other misconduct.\n\nThe tensions mark a potential setback for the Labour government’s effort to improve ties with Beijing. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met President Xi Jinping last month, in the first meeting between the countries’ leaders since 2018, promising to build “consistent, durable, respectful” relations.\n\nYang had developed business links to Prince Andrew and access to a network of other senior British political and business figures. He was also photographed with former Conservative prime ministers Lord David Cameron and Baroness Theresa May.\n\nMI5 had alleged Yang was a member of the CCP working for its United Front Work Department, which aims to build overseas influence and gather information. The case against him was premised in part on data unearthed from his phone, which the UK security services seized in November 2021.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Chinese embassy spokesperson said the United Front was “above board and beyond reproach”, characterising it as an attempt to promote co-operation between the CCP “and people who are not members of it and promote people-to-people exchanges and friendship with other countries”.\n\nYang had challenged the ban from the Home Office, an appeal that was rejected last week by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, and on Monday he hit out at his treatment. “The widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue,” he said.\n\n“The political climate has changed and unfortunately I have fallen victim to this,” he added. “When relations are good and Chinese investment is sought, I am welcome in the UK. When relations sour, an anti-China stance is taken, and I am excluded.”\n\nThe commission’s ruling found Yang “had been in a position to generate relationships with prominent UK figures and senior Chinese officials that could be leveraged for political interference purposes by the CCP . . . or the Chinese state”.",

    "blurb": "Linking subsidies to intellectual property is the sort of strategic inclusion that fosters mutual benefits ",
    "date": "2024-12-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The writer is a fellow on the Chinese economy at the Asia Society Policy Institute\n\nThe EU’s decision to demand technology transfers from Chinese companies in exchange for battery production subsidies is a bold idea with many detractors. Critics, both in Europe and abroad, warn of economic coercion, retaliation by Beijing and the risks of deepening China’s market influence in Europe.\n\nBut these concerns miss the point. The policy is neither capitulation nor gamble; it is a calculated response to the realities of the global competitive landscape for electric vehicles.\n\nThe EU’s requirements will align Chinese and European interests in ways that could redefine green ambitions. It is a strategy that the US, stuck in its obsession with tariffs and decoupling, should emulate.\n\nBy tying subsidies to technology transfers and local production requirements, Brussels ensures that Chinese companies contribute to the EU’s industrial base rather than merely exporting batteries. This approach mirrors other global trade practices. The US Inflation Reduction Act, for example, ties clean energy subsidies to domestic content.\n\nThe EU’s policy leverages the strength of China’s leadership in battery technology and production. Chinese industry insiders view it as an opportunity to deepen integration into European markets. By transferring technology and establishing local production, Chinese battery companies can secure access to critical resources in a region less prone to geopolitical tensions than the US.\n\nTariffs, by contrast, have done little to achieve their intended goals. They lead to workarounds, provoke retaliation and disrupt supply chains without addressing underlying industrial challenges. Europe is focusing on strategic inclusion rather than exclusion, fostering mutual benefits.\n\nEuropean EV makers need Chinese batteries. Look at the problems faced by Northvolt, Europe’s homegrown battery champion. Despite billions in funding and high-profile contracts, the Swedish company has struggled to scale up, facing operational hurdles and cost overruns. It has now filed for bankruptcy. Chinese companies, by contrast, dominate not just battery production but the entire ecosystem — cathodes, anodes, electrolytes and logistics. Europe will struggle to replicate these capabilities.\n\nThe EU’s tech transfer policy addresses this gap and will develop a resilient, domestically anchored Chinese battery industry. It also minimises the growing pains that come with starting from scratch. And it will position Europe to navigate a fraught global trade environment.\n\nThis strategy should also avoid internal EU divisions. Spain partners with Chinese companies on EVs, while France leans towards protectionism. The tech transfer policy aligns national and collective interests, creating a framework to share benefits equitably.\n\nThe US should take note. Its reliance on tariffs and the rhetoric of decoupling is more about posturing than progress. Restricting imports from China in the hope that domestic industries will flourish has not delivered. Instead, tariffs disrupt supply chains, drive up consumer costs and spur Chinese companies to adapt. Suppliers reroute exports through third countries, expand into alternative markets and continue innovating faster than their western counterparts.\n\nRather than shutting China out, the US should engage more strategically. Decoupling risks pushing China and Europe closer together. Beijing is already courting Brussels as a counterweight to US protectionism. Policies such as the EU’s tech transfer requirements deepen these ties.\n\nThe US does not need to abandon its concerns about China but it should rethink its approach. By adopting a version of the EU’s policy and tying market access to technology transfers and local production, America could ensure Chinese companies contribute to its growth while mitigating overreliance on imports.\n\nShifting the narrative around trade and industrial policy is crucial. Tariffs are politically expedient but economically flawed. A strategy combining engagement with strategic safeguards might be more difficult to explain to the public but it will be far more effective in practice.\n\nNeither the US nor Europe can afford to fall behind in the green technology race. The stakes are immense and the competition is unrelenting. By embracing a pragmatic framework, the west can position itself as an active architect of the clean-energy future.\n\nPragmatism is not weakness. Deals signal serious intent to secure a place in the green economy and ensure that Beijing does not have the final word.",

    "date": "2024-12-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Good morning. Germany is heading for early elections after Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence. The market was prepared: Germany’s main stock index, the Dax, barely moved and Bund yields were steady. It has been a wild year for democracy. Let’s hope things calm down over the holidays (looking at you, Brazil). Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and aiden.reiter@ft.com.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is the place where the euphoric US stock market and America’s trade war with China meet. For the past two years, AI hype has supercharged American semi stocks, including chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Micron, as well as makers of chipmaking tools such as Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA.\n\n(Nvidia is not included in this graph because its epic gains would have made everyone else’s impossible to distinguish.)\n\nAt the same time, the Biden administration has tried to limit the sale of chips and chipmaking tools to China. In October 2022, Washington banned the export of the most advanced chips and manufacturing equipment to Chinese companies with government ties. It followed up in October 2023, closing loopholes and restricting sales to data centres. Earlier this month, the US cracked down on more Chinese companies and pushed US allies to get more strict. The market appeared to anticipate the earlier announcements with trepidation, only to recover. Here is a graph of the the iShares US Semiconductor ETF, which tracks the major US semi stocks, with the period of the announcements shaded:\n\nCyclicality has been more important to the sector than the China rules. Most chip stocks, except AI favourites Nvidia and Broadcom, have been down since July, as demand has started to waver. Intel and Samsung in particular are struggling.\n\nThe toolmakers — including the three big US players KLA, Lam and Applied Materials, as well as Dutch ASML and Japanese Tokyo Electron — were at the centre of the December regulations. Over the long term, these have been incredible stocks to own: major barriers to entry and a secular tailwind from the silicon-isation of the economy have proven to be a powerful combination:\n\nThe toolmakers have not been completely barred from selling to China. Here is a chart of the percentage of their total revenues that came from China over the past five years:\n\nThe US, Netherlands, and Japan have already stopped the flow of the most advanced equipment, but there has been plenty of Chinese demand for more basic tools. December’s ruling, however, blocks all sales by US companies to many of the biggest Chinese buyers. And through various agreements between the US, Dutch and Japanese governments, the ban will apply to the US companies as well as ASML and Tokyo Electron.\n\nThis was largely expected by the industry, and by China — the big jump in revenue in 2024 suggests Chinese companies were buying heavily in anticipation of US restrictions.\n\nWhat will happen to the tool companies’ sales as the recent rule changes, and perhaps additional rules and tariffs brought to bear by the Trump administration, come into full effect? If cutting-edge chips cannot be made efficiently in China — and so far they can’t — they will be made somewhere else, and the toolmakers will ship tools there. But might the geographic transition be difficult for the tool industry? Or might restrictions serve to incubate new competitors within China, costing the incumbents market share?\n\nThe chief financial officer of ASML, Roger Dassen, recently said:\n\nThe CFO of Lam Research, Douglas Bettinger, struck a similar note at a recent industry conference:\n\nThe recent bans “did not destroy demand, but did change the composition of demand”, said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nCJ Muse at Cantor Fitzgerald is more sceptical. He thinks that cutting out China is a big revenue hit for the toolmakers, and one they may not get back. “China will build their own equipment industry as a result . . . .China will put more business in China, and there will be a share loss to all global companies,” he said.\n\nSince this summer, a combination of the cyclical swoon and fears about the trade war have driven the valuations of the US toolmakers, which had been trading at a big premium relative to the market, back to the small discount where they usually trade.\n\nIf you agree with Dassen, Allen and Bettinger that the trade wars are not a substantial threat to demand or market share, the stocks are quite appealing.\n\n(Reiter and Armstrong)\n\nA man of contradictions.",

    "date": "2024-12-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Two years after China introduced a pilot private pension scheme to address the challenges of its rapidly ageing population, the programme will be pushed out nationwide with the addition of 85 index funds.\n\nThe individual pension account programme was initially rolled out in November 2022 across 36 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Investors can put up to Rmb12,000 ($1,670) annually into tax-free accounts, mirroring the 401(k) plans in the US.\n\nDespite more than 60mn accounts being opened, the actual money invested in tens of millions of private pension scheme accounts remains very low or at zero. Even with the expansion, analysts highlight that further reforms and liberalisation are needed.\n\nA joint notice issued by four national regulators, including the National Financial Regulatory Administration and China Securities Regulatory Commission, announced that the scheme would be available across the country from December 15.\n\nPreviously the scheme only included pension funds of funds but it will now be expanded via a phased approach. Pension-linked share classes, or Y-class shares, will first be added to index funds, followed by bond products and active equities strategies at a later date.\n\nThe first batch of 85 index funds added to the individual private pension scheme from Monday will include popular products tracking broad-based indices such as the CSI 300, ChiNext and CSI A500.\n\nE Fund Management, China’s largest asset manager by retail fund assets, will see 11 index feeder and index-enhanced products added to the pension scheme. China Asset Management will have nine products added and Tianhong Asset Management will have eight products.\n\nOther companies with new products added to the scheme include Guangfa Fund Management, Harvest Fund Management, Fullgoal Fund Management and Bosera Asset Management.\n\nJPMorgan Asset Management is the only global asset manager running a wholly owned business in China with a single fund added to the scheme, the JPMorgan CSI A500 Exchange Traded Open Index Securities Investment Fund Linked Fund.\n\nIncluding the existing pension funds of funds, E Fund now has 24 products approved for the scheme, while ChinaAMC has 21 and JPMorgan AM’s China unit has three.\n\nBut China’s third-pillar private pension sector makes up just a “fraction” of the overall $4.4tn mutual fund industry, with domestic investors still largely unaware of the scheme, according to Morningstar.\n\nPension target securities investment funds account for only Rmb68bn or 0.2 per cent of the assets in onshore mutual funds as of the first quarter, and this proportion has fallen from a peak in 2021, the research firm reported in September.\n\nYang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund, told Ignites Asia that the 85 new index fund products had been added to the pension scheme, mainly to give investors more choice.\n\nHe added that poor market conditions in the past few years were partly to blame for the contribution rate not being very high, even as more personal pension accounts were being opened.\n\n“In the future, if the market can recover, it is expected that more people will open accounts and participate in the pension scheme,” he added.\n\nDespite supportive top-down policies, analysts point to some elements of the scheme that could be improved.\n\nYang said that annual contribution limit could be raised because Rmb12,000 was not sufficient to meet the needs of high earners, and more tax incentives could be added to convince investors to build up their personal pensions.\n\nJia Zhi, managing director of the asset management department at ChinaLin Securities, stressed that middle- and high-income earners who wanted to save on tax felt that the Rmb12,000 limit was not enough.\n\nIf such investors could not benefit from tax incentives, they needed a moderate subsidy to increase the incentive to participate in the pension scheme, he concluded.\n\nThe CSRC has also mandated fee reductions on pension products, including management and redemption fees, in a bid to attract more investors.\n\nNew pension-linked Y-share classes for funds will be set at the lowest level. ETF feeder funds will have management fees of 0.15 per cent and a custody fee of 0.05 per cent, while most index funds have a management fee of 0.25 per cent.\n\nThe Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security is also expected to issue updated criteria, such as fund size, fees and performance, to determine eligible bond and equities products for future inclusion in the further of the scheme expansion.",

    "body": "The writer is chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis and senior research fellow at Bruegel\n\nThe Chinese economy has been struggling since the end of the pandemic, forced to rely on external demand as an engine of growth. It has been helped by a very weak renminbi, which has boosted the country’s competitiveness, facilitating fast growth in exports despite protectionist measures by the US and now a spread of other countries.\n\nHowever, the currency shift has made imports more expensive. And the very much needed support of exports has started to wane, clouding further the economic outlook for 2025.\n\nThe Chinese currency also has dropped to a level against the dollar which is likely to bring it even closer to the attention of Donald Trump as he prepares to return to the White House, given his well-known obsession about undervalued currencies and large trade surpluses. Since the end of September, the renminbi has weakened almost 4 per cent to nearly Rmb7.3 against the dollar.\n\nAgainst such a backdrop, the idea has been mooted of a grand bargain between the US and China, which would strengthen the Chinese currency and depreciate the dollar. Such a potential deal has been dubbed the Mar-a-Lago Accord, an echo of the landmark 1985 Plaza Accord in which the US persuaded Japan to accept a sharp appreciation of the yen, through concerted intervention by the five largest central banks in the world and other measures.\n\nWould China go for a similar deal? Well the first thing to acknowledge is how negatively the Plaza Accord has been interpreted among Chinese policymakers for decades. In particular, the impact of a very rapid appreciation of the yen from ¥237 to the dollar in August 1985 to less than ¥140 in April 1987.\n\nThe severe headwinds in exports were counterbalanced by the Bank of Japan with a rapid reduction in policy rates from 5 per cent in 1985 to 2.5 per cent in February 1987. But this only proved a trigger for the build-up of Japan’s real estate and stock market bubbles. These ended up bursting in 1990, leading to Japan’s two lost decades of meagre growth and deflationary pressures due to the collapse in corporate profitability and nominal wages.\n\nJapan’s bitter lesson is probably enough to discourage Chinese policymakers from acceding to pressure from Trump. In the most recent trade agreement between Trump and Xi, the so-called the Phase I deal in winter 2019-20, the US did include an exchange component but the label of China as currency manipulator was finally dropped.\n\nBeyond China’s dislike of any agreement which resembles the Plaza Accord, there are other important reasons why a Mar-a-Lago pact of a similar scale is unlikely.\n\nFirst, China’s economic situation is not that of Japan in the early 1980s but rather that of the early 1990s. China’s real estate bubble has already burst and deflationary pressures have been present for more than two years already. There is also overcapacity in a number of manufacturing sectors. In other words. China will find it very hard to cope with a strong currency, even more than Japan did in the 1980s.\n\nSecond, China’s macroeconomic imbalances are larger than those of Japan at the time, with the saving ratio being much higher and consumption much lower. In other words, China needs exports even more than Japan did then, making a potential appreciation of the renminbi much more costly. Finally, China still counts on rather draconian capital controls to isolate its exchange rate from monetary policy decisions, making it easier for China to keep a weak renminbi without paying a high price in terms of capital outflows.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, a weak renminbi is not a free lunch for China either. One of the most negative unintended consequences comes from discouraging the international use of the renminbi, especially as an investment currency. After years of work on this, the renminbi’s international use remains underwhelming, especially when compared with the size of the Chinese economy. There have been gains made since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as the currency has been used to bypass sanctions imposed by the West on Russia-related transactions. But even these are vanishing again due to renminbi weakness and the fear of secondary sanctions by the US.\n\nAll in all, Chinese policymakers still see the renminbi as an export tool, which is highly necessary given stubbornly stagnant domestic demand. The market should get used to a weak renminbi. For China, once again, supporting growth comes first.",

    "date": "2024-12-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "The alleged Chinese spy linked to Prince Andrew has been publicly named as Tengbo Yang after a judge lifted an anonymity order, raising fresh questions about his connections to the British establishment.\n\nThe 50-year-old Chinese national has been banned from entering Britain on national security grounds since March 2023. MI5 has alleged that Yang — who advised UK companies spanning GSK and McLaren — worked for a group gathering intelligence on behalf of the Chinese state.\n\nYang had challenged the ban from the Home Office, an appeal that was rejected last week by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, and on Monday he hit out at his treatment.\n\n“The widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue,” he said. “The political climate has changed and unfortunately I have fallen victim to this. When relations are good and Chinese investment is sought, I am welcome in the UK. When relations sour, an anti-China stance is taken, and I am excluded.”\n\nYang’s case has reignited debate about the extent to which the UK government should be reviving relations with Beijing. His activities have also highlighted the fine line between the legitimate activities of consultants, and what MI5 director-general Ken McCallum has referred to in relation to China as “interference activity — influencing that is clandestine, coercive or corruptive.”\n\nYang had developed business links to Prince Andrew and access to a network of other senior British political and business figures, primarily through his company Hampton Group International, which said it focused on “investing in, consulting on and enabling opportunities between China, the UK and the rest of the world”.\n\nThe commission’s ruling found that Yang “had been in a position to generate relationships with prominent UK figures and senior Chinese officials that could be leveraged for political interference purposes by the CCP [Chinese Communist party] . . . or the Chinese State”.\n\nMI5 had alleged Yang was a member of the Chinese Communist party working for the United Front Work Department, which gathers intelligence.\n\nThe judges found there was “not an abundance of evidence of the UFWD links” but there was an inconsistency between some of the evidence and Yang’s “claims that he had no connections to anyone in politics in China”.\n\nYang previously worked with UK drugmaker GSK to manage the fallout of a bribery scandal in China, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nGSK did not comment.\n\nThe pharmaceuticals group was introduced to Yang by Sir Ron Dennis, the former chief executive of McLaren, one of the people said. Dennis declined to comment. McLaren did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGordonstoun, the Scottish boarding school attended by Prince Andrew and King Charles, said on Monday that it had terminated an agreement with Yang’s company Hampton Group International.\n\nHampton Group International signed an agreement in 2019 with Gordonstoun to establish sister campuses in China. The school said that “for legal reasons” it was “unable to provide further details at this time”.\n\nAs well as his links to the royal family, Yang met and was photographed with former Conservative prime ministers Lord David Cameron and Baroness Theresa May. It was unclear when the encounters occurred and there is no suggestion either politician knew Yang personally.\n\nDowning Street declined to comment on Monday whether Sir Keir Starmer had ever met Yang.\n\nThe anonymity order was reviewed during a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice on Monday, ahead of MPs threatening to use parliamentary privilege to name Yang in the House of Commons.\n\nSir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, granted an urgent question on Monday tabled by Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a leading Tory China hawk, who warned that Yang was “not a lone wolf”.\n\nDan Jarvis, UK security minister, welcomed the court’s decision to uphold the ban on Yang entering the country and warned that “this case does not exist in a vacuum”.\n\nHe told MPs that Britain faces “ongoing efforts by a number of states, including China, Russia and Iran, to harm the UK’s security” and said the government’s response was “among the most robust and sophisticated anywhere in the world”.\n\nJarvis said the Home Office was “working hard” on rolling out a new foreign influence registration scheme — loosely modelled on the US Foreign Agents Registration Act — to start next summer.\n\nThe case against Yang was premised in part on data unearthed from his phone seized by the UK security services in November 2021.\n\nOne document titled “talking points for the duke” from August 2021 suggested Prince Andrew was in a “desperate situation and will grab on to anything”.\n\nHowever, Peter Humphrey, external research associate of Harvard University’s Fairbank Centre for China studies, said Prince Andrew’s role in the saga was something of a distraction.\n\n“What we should really be worried about is the members of the political elite in parliament who have been involved with this man.”\n\nOnce referred to as China’s “magic weapon”, the UFWD which Yang was allegedly linked to, aims to win support for China’s political agenda, build overseas influence and gather information.\n\nIt concentrates on influencing overseas politicians and the Chinese diaspora and infiltrating Chinese students at international universities.\n\nIts highest body is the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body that meets annually. As late as March 2022, the China Daily state media outlet interviewed Yang describing him as an overseas delegate to the CPPCC.\n\nHe told the newspaper he had “actively participated” in President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative, the infrastructure-building programme seen as spearheading China’s global economic influence, particularly in developing countries.\n\n“China-UK co-operation in third-party markets is showing new characteristics of . . . promoting harmonious regional development,” he said, echoing Communist party propaganda. “We will link China’s kinetic energy to Britain’s potential energy.”\n\nResponding to questions about Yang at a press briefing in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said: “China’s actions have been above board and there is no such thing as deceitful actions or interference.”",

    "blurb": "Dutch national is first EU citizen targeted in relation to western price cap measures introduced after full-scale Ukraine invasion",
    "date": "2024-12-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "The EU has imposed sanctions on Dutch national Niels Troost over his alleged involvement in trading Russian crude oil above the price cap set by western countries in response to Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTroost, who lives in Switzerland, is the first EU national to be targeted by the bloc for trading Russian oil.\n\nIn a statement to the Financial Times, Troost criticised the decision, which he claimed was the result of a campaign by a former business partner to exaggerate his links to Moscow after their business relationship collapsed.\n\nAn FT investigation published last week reported that the business partner, Gaurav Kumar Srivastava, had told Troost that he was a covert operative working with the CIA and promised to secure a licence from the US Treasury to allow Troost’s company to legally trade Russian crude above the cap. Since Troost identified the alleged deception and terminated the partnership in May 2023, he has accused Srivastava of embarking on a campaign to destroy his reputation.\n\nSrivastava has denied the allegations and accused Troost of lying.\n\nTroost and one of his company’s directors, Francois Mauron, were placed under sanctions by the UK in February 2024 and November 2023, respectively.\n\nThe EU sanctions cited the decision by Troost’s Geneva-based Paramount Energy and Commodities SA to transfer its Russian oil trading activity to a Dubai-based subsidiary in June 2022. That company, Paramount DMCC, then “repeatedly traded Russian crude oil” at prices above the $60-a-barrel cap introduced in December 2022, the EU said.\n\nTroost has said he was advised by his lawyers that subsidiaries in the United Arab Emirates were not required to comply with the price cap if the European parent company was not involved in its operations and therefore recused himself and Paramount SA from all involvement after the rules came into place.\n\nThe EU also cited Troost’s alleged “affiliation” with a Hong-Kong based ship charterer called Livna Shipping, which it said had also traded Russian oil above the cap.\n\nIn October, representatives for Srivastava shared information with the FT that made similar allegations about ongoing ties between Troost and Livna. When the FT sought comment from Troost he shared documents showing he had sold the business in 2018.\n\nIn a response to the FT, Livna said Troost has had “no interest in the management or ownership of the company” since October 2018. Livna “charters vessels for its clients, and the company does not undertake and has never undertaken any trading activities itself”, it said, adding that it “adheres to all applicable laws and regulations in all its activities”.\n\nReferring to the EU move, a spokesperson for Troost said: “This decision has no basis in law or fact. Neither Mr Troost nor his companies have ever breached any laws or regulations, and he has had no corporate affiliation to Livna Shipping since he sold shares in the company in 2018.\n\n“The EU has aligned itself with a well-reported misinformation campaign related to a business dispute.”\n\nThe statement added Troost was “not aware of any investigation into him in the Netherlands, Switzerland or the US” and would challenge the EU sanctions designation, which it said had breached “his human rights and EU law”.\n\nIn a statement in response, Srivastava said: “The European Union meticulously investigates the individuals and entities it sanctions. The evidence has spoken.”",

    "blurb": "Consumption rises less than forecast in November, highlighting why leadership made it the top economic concern",
    "date": "2024-12-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Retail sales in China missed expectations in November, adding to pressure on policymakers after President Xi Jinping signalled last week that he wanted to spur household consumption to boost the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThe consumption measure added 3 per cent year on year, below a forecast of 4.6 per cent in a Reuters poll and last month’s rise of 4.8 per cent. Industrial production added 5.4 per cent, slightly above predictions.\n\nThe unexpectedly weaker growth comes days after the Communist party leadership called for “vigorous” efforts to boost consumption and domestic demand at the annual Central Economic Work Conference last week.\n\nThe November retail number “was the big disappointment of the month, as retail sales . . . came in well softer than both consensus and our forecasts”, said Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at ING in a research note.\n\nBeijing has struggled to boost confidence against the backdrop of a property slowdown, now entering its fourth year, and bouts of deflation. The government unveiled a series of measures to boost stock markets in late September and to refinance local government debt last month.\n\nChinese equities fell on Monday. The CSI 300 index of blue-chip mainland-listed companies closed down 0.5 per cent while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 0.9 per cent.\n\nChina’s 10-year sovereign bond yield fell 0.06 percentage points to 1.73 per cent and its 30-year yield fell below 2 per cent for the first time.\n\nThe work conference’s report last week listed consumption as the first of nine economic priorities for 2025, ahead of the “new productive forces” that have emerged as a core pillar of Xi’s approach.\n\nThe emphasis is one of several signs of growing urgency from the government, including a shift in its monetary policy stance to “moderately loose” from “prudent” for the first time in more than a decade last week.\n\nConsumer prices in November rose just 0.2 per cent, a five-month low. Prices have increased every month since January but growth has remained close to deflationary territory, adding to concerns over the strength of domestic demand.\n\nConsumer spending was an economic concern in China during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the government imposed strict lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus, and has failed to bounce back fully since a reopening almost two years ago.\n\nING’s Song said that aside from the National Bureau of Statistics’ property price index for 70 cities, which showed marginal falls during the month and indicated a stabilisation, the overall data was softer than expected in November.\n\nProperty investment was still declining, falling 10.4 per cent in the 11 months to the end of November, the NBS said, compared with a fall of 10.3 per cent in the first 10 months.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists attributed the soft retail sales to an earlier than usual start to the annual November “Singles Day” online shopping festival, which pulled forward some sales to October.\n\nBut Goldman and other economists said that overall, indicators suggested annual growth this year would end close to the government’s official target of 5 per cent.\n\nXi last week pledged to meet the target, saying China would continue “to play its role as the world’s largest economic growth engine”.\n\nCiti analysts said the government would probably release few details of any proposed fiscal stimulus measures until early next year during the annual meeting of China’s rubber stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress. This normally sets out the economic agenda for the following 12 months.\n\n“The politburo and CEWC concluded with a supportive tone but no major breakthroughs or concrete measures,” Citi said. “The next two months could be a policy vacuum until the NPC.”",

    "body": "Good morning. A scoop to start: deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad airlifted $250mn to Russia in shipments of $100 bills and €500 notes weighing nearly two tonnes, stashing them in sanctioned banks while he waged war against his own people, according to financial records seen by the Financial Times.\n\nToday, our competition correspondent reveals the IMF’s concerns over rising EU state aid, and I explain why Germany’s chancellor actually wants to lose a no-confidence vote today.\n\nThe IMF has warned the EU its soaring state aid handouts must be “laser-focused” and co-ordinated or they risk undermining efforts to compete with rival economies such as China, writes Javier Espinoza.\n\nContext: The EU is battling an identity crisis over its sliding economic competitiveness compared with the US and China, which are outperforming and outspending the European economy in key sectors.\n\nIn a report published today and seen by the FT, the IMF says industrial policy is “having a moment” in Europe, as policymakers take an increasingly interventionist approach to power the green transition and protect the economy and supply chains.\n\nBut it warns that more central co-ordination is needed to make sure that EU countries don’t out-subsidise each other.\n\nState aid by member nations tripled over the past decade, rising from 0.5 of GDP in 2012 to around 1.5 per cent in 2022, mainly linked to green technologies and energy efficiency, the IMF found.\n\nWhile subsidies can boost innovation, productivity and incomes, they can also backfire if poorly co-ordinated, particularly in an open economy such as the EU’s, the IMF warns.\n\n“European state aid benefits recipient firms but is often detrimental to others,” the IMF writes, cautioning against “unilateral industrial policies”.\n\nThe paper, for instance, cites German state aid to electrical and optical equipment manufacturers which are to the detriment of its trading partner France.\n\nThe report finds that while the bloc’s current framework on state aid is a “good starting point”, more co-operation is needed, for instance in the form of joint programmes. It points to joint ventures such as that which became Airbus — funded by the UK, France and the former West Germany close to half a century ago — as success stories worth replicating.\n\nThe European Commission oversees competition and state aid policy in the bloc, but the IMF believes more centralised powers are needed to boost common initiatives.\n\n“A centralised decision-making body could streamline priorities and better allocate resources to areas of mutual benefit,” the report states.\n\nPolicymakers worry that divisions among EU countries will make it harder to respond to a potential flood of cheap goods from China, diverted to the EU when the US imposes higher tariffs on Beijing.\n\nIn a brutal illustration of the woeful state of Germany’s political direction, the country’s chancellor will face a no-confidence vote today, and wants to lose it.\n\nContext: Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats and his Green partners don’t have a parliamentary majority, after the chancellor sacked his liberal finance minister Christian Lindner in November, whose FDP party then pulled out of the ruling coalition.\n\nScholz, as head of the EU’s biggest economy and most powerful member state, should bestride Europe. But his three-year long stint as chancellor has been marked by economic decline, coalition infighting and constant indecision, crippling Berlin’s clout in Brussels.\n\nThat has infuriated his EU partners, who attribute much blame for the continent’s current industrial malaise on German inaction.\n\nScholz will hope Germany’s parliament puts his moribund regime out of its misery today, triggering a constitutional trapdoor that will allow for an election on February 23 for which Germany’s politicians are already informally campaigning.\n\nThe SPD has the support of 17 per cent of voters, according to a poll published this weekend. The centre-right Christian Democratic Union leads with 31 per cent together with its Bavarian sister party, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) holds 20 per cent.\n\nThe AfD sees a tactical advantage in delaying the next election in order to eat into the CDU lead, and has mooted the possibility of springing a surprise today by voting in support of Scholz.\n\nBut most assume the procedural denouement will fall as planned, and let everyone get on with the business of canvassing for votes.\n\nThe CDU’s candidate for chancellor Friedrich Merz is the strong favourite to succeed Scholz, but there is no guarantee he would be able to build a more productive coalition.\n\nOther EU capitals certainly hope he can. With France in an arguably deeper political morass, many hope a resurgent Berlin — with the clout both to take decisions and pay for them — will mark a change in fortunes inside and outside Germany’s borders.",

    "date": "2024-12-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Brussels fears divisions between member states will hamper its ability to combat a potential flood of cheap goods from China — dumped by Beijing in response to the prospect of higher US tariffs — with sanctions of their own.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s threat to tax Chinese imports by up to 60 per cent during his second term has raised concerns that Beijing will seek to regain the market share lost in the US by dumping more goods in other markets — including the EU.\n\nA flood of discounted Chinese goods would leave domestic manufacturers struggling to compete, raising the prospect of retaliatory trade action from the EU.\n\nBut policymakers are worried that the traditional trade measures it has at its disposal would be too slow to deploy and would rely on a strong consensus from member states, some of which may prefer to bow to Beijing than Brussels.\n\n“With China we have seen how easily the EU fragments when others exert pressure,” said one EU lawmaker, who declined to be named.\n\nThey noted Germany and four other states voted against tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in October after Beijing threatened access to its car market. China then slapped its own antidumping duties on cognac, hitting France, which backed the measures.\n\nWith the EU’s export-dependent economy heavily exposed to a global trade war — and the likes of the US and China able to impose tariffs and subsidies almost instantaneously — some officials fear the bloc’s commitment to following World Trade Organization rules will lead them struggling to protect their manufacturing industry.\n\nThey are pushing for more EU powers to respond.\n\n“Our efforts must also include strengthening our [defensive] tools,” said Sabine Weyand, the European Commission’s top trade official, this month. “[We] will only be able to maintain our commitment to openness if we are able to effectively defend the single market.”\n\nThe discussions, which are at an early stage, come after commission vice-president Stéphane Séjourné warned in a Financial Times interview that the bloc could not be the outlet for global “overcapacities”, warning that permitting this to happen would lead to a “short-term economic crisis”.\n\nTrump, who is able to impose tariffs using executive powers once he returns to office on January 20, vowed in late November to charge an additional 10 per cent on Chinese products, alongside new 25 per cent levies on Canada and Mexico. He threatened levies of up to 60 per cent on China during the campaign.\n\n“The more that trade barriers go up in one part of the world to Chinese goods, the more Chinese exporters will direct them to other markets,” said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. “The EU tends to follow the rule book quite closely, which constrains what it can do.”\n\nIgnacio García Bercero, a former senior commission trade official, told the FT that the EU could use existing “safeguard measures”, which enable Brussels to quickly introduce tariffs or quotas when there are sudden surges in imports.\n\nOnce the commission proposes tariffs, member states vote on whether to approve them. However, if four or more member states comprising at least 35 per cent of the population vote no, they do not apply.\n\nThe EU can also launch investigations if it feels particular sectors are being harmed by underpriced products. But a recent probe into Beijing subsidising its electric vehicle producers took more than a year as officials built up mountains of evidence.\n\nThe fact that four member states can block defensive measures has also led some policymakers to argue the commission needs more tools of its own.\n\nIn a sign of how fractious the introduction of restrictions on Beijing could prove, the EU executive had to initiate the EV anti-subsidy case itself as no member state or company dared to file a complaint.\n\nMartin Kocher, Austria’s economy minister, said in an interview with the FT in December the priority was still to “keep up the conversation” with Beijing while sticking to WTO rules. He argued that there was no need for any “additional tools to defend the single market against unfair competition”.\n\nA renminbi devaluation could intensify the effects of China dumping cheap products on EU markets.\n\nJu Wang, head of Greater China FX and rates strategy for BNP Paribas, expected the People’s Bank of China to allow the dollar to strengthen up to Rmb7.7 per dollar under a 60 per cent tariff scenario, and within a range of Rmb7.4-7.5 under a 20-25 per cent tariff scenario.\n\nJu added that the PBoC would act only when US tariffs were made official, “to avoid the move being viewed as a trigger for a currency war”.\n\nMany emerging market economies are imposing restrictions on Chinese goods imports — potentially squeezing more of them to Europe.\n\n“The cascade effect of Chinese exports is going beyond developed markets,” said Richard McGregor, a former FT journalist who is now a senior fellow of the Lowy Institute in Australia. “Many countries which China counts as friends in the global south are putting up barriers, like Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia among others.”\n\nThe commission has already stocked its arsenal with new weapons since Trump’s first four-year term, which concluded in 2021.\n\nThey include an anti-coercion instrument, which allows it to quickly retaliate against countries introducing export restrictions or import embargoes.\n\nThe commission can also penalise companies receiving subsidies that “distort” the internal market and take action against countries that do not open up their public procurement markets.\n\nIt has also opted to backdate any tariffs to the day the investigation was opened, preventing an import surge to dodge them.\n\nHowever, Weyand said Brussels needed a new “doctrine” about how to use these new powers to create predictability.\n\nAdditional reporting by Thomas Hale in Shanghai\n\nData visualisation by Janina Conboye in London",

    "body": "Australia has felt the ripple effect of a weaker Chinese economy as it is set to cut A$8.5bn ($5.4bn) from its budget estimates because of lower anticipated income from mining taxes over the next four years.\n\nJim Chalmers, Australia’s treasurer, said on Monday that slower growth in China would have a “significant impact” on the Australian economy in the coming years, ahead of revised budget forecasts to be published on Wednesday.\n\nThe Treasury would lower anticipated export revenue from the country’s mining sector by A$100bn in the four years to 2028, according to Chalmers, with anticipated taxes reduced by A$8.5bn over the same period as a result.\n\n“This just reflects the reality of less demand out of China,” he said, citing weak iron ore prices and lower volumes of minerals being exported to the country because of its soft economy.\n\nThe trading relationship between China and Australia has been in focus in recent years after Beijing imposed a series of sanctions on some Australian goods, including coal, wine, cotton, seafood and barley, in 2020.\n\nAustralia withstood that pressure and China remained its largest trading partner thanks to its reliance on the Pacific country’s natural resources for its industrial growth.\n\nChina accounted for nearly a third of Australia’s exports in 2023, worth A$219bn, according to government data. That was down from 38 per cent in 2020 but still represented 8 per cent of Australia’s GDP, according to UBS.\n\nA softer Chinese economy in 2024 has hit commodity prices, including iron ore — which accounts for more than half of the value of exports to China — and lithium. That has had a knock-on effect in Australia’s powerful mining sector, which has remained optimistic that demand from growing sectors, such as renewable energy and carmaking, might help offset a slump in China’s property sector.\n\nAustralia’s economic growth has slowed this year, mostly because of weak consumption and declining productivity. Third-quarter GDP growth was weaker than expected and has cast doubt over the resilience of the Australian economy.\n\nChalmers noted on Monday that Australia’s trading relationship with other countries would “evolve over time”. He said there had been a “stunning transformation” of the Chinese economy that was set to continue in consumer-focused industries.\n\n“We have been a big beneficiary of that and I think we’ll be a big beneficiary of it into the future as well,” he said of the “very productive and prosperous relationship with China” that Australia enjoyed.",

    "blurb": "Home secretary says Britain will take robust approach to any challenge to national or economic security",
    "date": "2024-12-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK home secretary Yvette Cooper has defended her government’s attempts to bolster economic ties with China, in spite of new claims of a suspected Chinese spy infiltrating the British establishment.\n\nCooper said Britain continued to take a robust approach to any challenge “to our national security, our economic security, from China or other countries around the world”.\n\nBut she told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “With China, we also have to ensure we have that economic interaction and co-operation in place as well. It’s a complex arrangement.”\n\nCooper’s comments came after it emerged that a suspected Chinese spy had become a confidant of the Duke of York. Prince Andrew said he broke off contacts with him after being warned about their activities.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is attempting to build ties with Beijing in an effort to boost economic growth and he held talks with Xi Jinping, China’s president, at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro last month.\n\nRachel Reeves, the chancellor, will travel to Beijing for an “economic and financial dialogue” next month, following on from a visit to the Chinese capital by foreign secretary David Lammy in October.\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith, former Conservative leader, told the Financial Times that Starmer was trying to take Britain back 10 years to the “ridiculous George Osborne ‘golden era’”, a reference to the former Tory chancellor’s courtship of China.\n\nDuncan Smith, who was sanctioned by China in 2021, said: “I don’t know what it takes for pompous prime ministers to realise China doesn’t care about us. They want us to buy their goods and they try to infiltrate our institutions.”\n\nHe claimed that Beijing saw Britain as the “soft underbelly” of the western security network known as “the five eyes”, comprising the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK.\n\nThe alleged Chinese agent who had links with Prince Andrew has been excluded from Britain. An immigration tribunal hearing on Thursday upheld an earlier decision by the Home Office to ban the 50-year-old Chinese national.\n\nMI5 had alleged they were a member of the Chinese Communist party working for the United Front Work Department, which gathers intelligence on behalf of the Chinese state, the tribunal heard.\n\nData downloaded by the UK Security Service from the man’s phone in November 2021, after he was stopped at the border, revealed his close relations to the late Queen Elizabeth’s second son, according to tribunal documents.\n\nHe had established “an unusual degree of trust” with the duke and had been authorised to act on his behalf “in engagements with potential partners and investors in China”, according to the documents.\n\nThe Chinese national had also been an honorary member of the 48 Group Club, which was set up in the 1940s to promote trading ties between China and the UK and whose members include senior British politicians, civil servants, business executives and diplomats.\n\nIn the process he had developed a high-level network of business, political and royal figures in the British establishment, which the tribunal heard “could be leveraged for political interference purposes by the CCP (including the UFWD) or the Chinese state”.\n\nAmong former business clients with whom he worked as a consultant in China were GSK and the high-end car manufacturer McLaren.\n\nHe had also advised the China Minsheng Investment Group, a Chinese private equity company, on entering the UK market. The lawyer representing him during his appeal against exclusion emphasised the value to the UK of some of these activities.",

    "blurb": "Aircraft designed to accompany crewed stealth jets could help Beijing challenge American air superiority",
    "date": "2024-12-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s development of stealth fighter jets has drawn global attention, but just as significant, analysts say, is the unveiling of its attack drones — a fast-emerging area of defence competition with the US.\n\nThe updated Feihong FH-97A, a so-called loyal wingman drone, of which a prototype was on static display last month at the biennial Zhuhai air show in southern China, boasts an enhanced weapons bay, allowing it to conduct both ground and air strikes. The drone, designed to accompany crewed aircraft, also has the ability to catapult launch from aircraft carriers.\n\nThe mass adoption of drones on both sides of Russia’s war against Ukraine has shaken up the global defence industry in recent years, with militaries around the world seeking to integrate the latest unmanned technologies into their arsenals.\n\nAnalysts say wingman drones are now at the centre of the technological race between China and the US for air superiority, a competition that has only become more pressing as tensions escalate over Taiwan, which Beijing views as its territory and has threatened to claim by force if necessary.\n\n“In the future, [the FH-97A] will be extremely important,” said Ni Lexiong, a Shanghai-based military analyst. “The future of war will be competition between drone and anti-drone technology.”\n\nWingman drones offer Chinese manufacturers a space to catch up with the US military, said Peter Layton, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank.\n\nHe said China had built and was flying some wingman drones that it aimed to “operate with the two-seat version of the J-20”, China’s older stealth fighter. But showing models at air shows was “different from actually flying them” operationally, Layton said, adding that details were too scarce to determine which country was ahead.\n\nThe FH-97A, developed by Aerospace Times Feihong Technology Corp, is designed for “confrontational, high-intensity and long-lasting combat”, its parent company, the state-owned Ninth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, wrote in a WeChat post last month.\n\nThe aircraft will be able to both lead swarms of smaller drones and act as a companion “wingman” to manned stealth fighter jets, with the fighter pilots controlling their own plane and the accompanying drone, according to analysts.\n\n“The FH-97A drone meets the four [main] trends in the development of weapons . . . it is unmanned, miniaturised, intelligent and stealthy,” said Ni.\n\nMilitaries around the world are looking to wingman technology, which would allow them to dramatically strengthen their aerial forces at a lower cost than producing manned fighter jets and training pilots.\n\nThe US is also pushing ahead with its own loyal wingmen programme, known as collaborative combat aircraft (CCA), following delays to work on parts of its sixth-generation fighter, analysts said.\n\n“Loyal wingpersons are . . . one of the things that every air force, every major company, wants,” said Sash Tusa, an aerospace and defence analyst at Agency Partners. “It’s a way of restoring scale as manned aircraft get more expensive, it’s a way of increasing coverage geographically [and] it’s a way of increasing weapon loadout.”\n\nHe estimated that it would take leading militaries five to 10 years to be able to deploy the technology, with cost effective production a major hurdle. “If anyone does it, it will probably be the Americans or the Chinese first.”\n\nOther experts said that, based on the available information about each country’s prototypes, China’s loyal wingperson drones may have an advantage, given their claimed ability to carry out ground strikes.\n\nLayton said the US and its allies — such as Australia, which is developing the Ghost Bat loyal wingman drone with Boeing — appeared to be concentrating on drones that carried sensors rather than weapons, which require increasing the size and weight of the aircraft.\n\nWith the US planning to deploy 150 loyal wingmen by the end of the decade, he predicted that the aircraft would “rely a lot on artificial intelligence”.\n\nThe US is “moving fairly fast”, Layton added.\n\nJames Char, assistant professor and an expert on China’s military at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, said the US and China were also developing various land and sea drones, such as China’s robot wolves.\n\nThese assault-rifle armed machines can operate in packs and were designed to clear beaches of defensive forces, according to state media — a capability with possible implications for any conflict over Taiwan.\n\n“We are seeing a lot of reports about what these drones can do on the battlefield,” he said. “But what they can actually do, no one is sure.”",

    "blurb": "Ozon and Wildberries welcome Chinese sellers looking for new markets as sanctions hit both countries’ traders",
    "date": "2024-12-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "A growing number of Chinese ecommerce merchants are selling their products on Russia’s largest online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to the platforms to find new markets and avoid western tariffs.\n\nOzon Global, the international version of one of Russia’s largest ecommerce platforms, sources 80 per cent of its orders from China and told the Financial Times it had signed up at least 100,000 sellers from the country. In 2022, Chinese sellers numbered about 10,000. Wildberries, the largest platform by sales, said it had formally launched a channel for Chinese sellers last year, with industry sources confirming growing interest in selling on the platform.\n\nSeveral Chinese suppliers said that as well as opening accounts on the sites’ dedicated international platforms, they were also registering local Russian ecommerce stores — a process that requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses and receiving payment in roubles.\n\nChinese suppliers said they were eager to fill the gap left by a retreat of international business from Russia following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. They added that the country was a source of alternative demand as western markets including the EU and the US moved to close lucrative tax loopholes that boosted China’s ecommerce industry.\n\n“Because it’s fair to say that the US and European markets have now been affected [negatively] and because relations between China and Russia are pretty good, everyone is investing more [in the Russian market],” said Yarong Wuliu, deputy secretary-general of the cross-border ecommerce division of the China Association for Small and Medium Commercial Enterprises, who helps SMEs hoping to open accounts on Ozon.\n\nChinese ecommerce trade grew 13 per cent in the first six months of this year from the previous year to a record Rmb1.25tn ($175bn), or 5.9 per cent of total imports and exports for the period, according to official figures. Ecommerce grew 15.6 per cent in 2023, accounting for 5.7 per cent of China’s total goods trade, up from 4.9 per cent the year before and 1 per cent in 2015, official figures show.\n\nHenry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University, said bilateral ecommerce trade had been growing swiftly. “On the Chinese side, [it’s] the downturn in their established markets like the US and the EU, especially their push to reduce reliance on China, or even ban certain Chinese shopping platforms,” he said. “And on the Russian side, China is basically their only lifeline in view of all these sanctions.”\n\nWei, an ecommerce trader in Shenzhen who asked for his full name to be withheld, said he opened a store selling consumer electronics on Ozon Global two years ago as a recent university graduate.\n\n“We only have a market because the US enforced sanctions against Russia,” he said. “It’s pretty good compared to other platforms. The profit margins are decent . . . the competition isn’t as fierce.”\n\nHowever, sellers have complained of difficulties in receiving payments in renminbi following sanctions against Russia. At times, Ozon has banned the sale of certain items on its cross-border channel to ensure it meets global legal requirements. But Wei and others said they had managed to avoid both problems by opening locally registered stores.\n\nPopular posts on Chinese social media platforms, including Instagram-like Xiaohongshu, detail the benefits of opening accounts on Ozon’s local stream. Others advertise services opening Russian bank accounts and registering local businesses. One such account contacted by the FT said they could register a Russian company to run local ecommerce stores for about Rmb30,000.\n\nFor a higher fee, the company could also try to find a Russian legal representative as a nominal head of the company, they said.\n\nDemand for Russian business registrations was driven by ecommerce merchants, primarily on Ozon and Wildberries, and had taken off since the start of the country’s war against Ukraine, the person added.\n\nEason Chen, who runs a China-Russia logistics company in Shenzhen, said demand from ecommerce sellers looking to set up local stores had started to outpace business from traditional trading companies. “All I can say is that [demand] will continue to grow,” he said.\n\nOzon said overseas sellers accounted for just 5 per cent of its total product range and that it did not support Chinese sellers importing goods to sell on Russian storefronts. All sellers were now receiving payments on time, it added.\n\nWildberries said it was assessing the Chinese market “through a limited number of local manufacturers and sellers who can supply their products directly to all countries where the company is present”.\n\nJen Yang, an ecommerce merchant selling furniture and household goods, said she opened her Ozon stores in 2022 after three years of only selling on Amazon, hoping to fulfil unmet demand for daily goods in Russia.\n\nShe said she now made about Rmb20,000 a month from sales on her stores on the platform, which accounts for about 30 per cent of her ecommerce sales.\n\nWhile she had also opened two domestic Ozon stores, she was still “testing the waters” given concerns over converting her profits back into renminbi, but she added that demand overall in Russia was fairly strong.\n\n“China is a manufacturing powerhouse, so basically we can sell anything they need,” she said.",

    "blurb": "Newly listed group plans to quadruple fleet and predicts big cities will extend boundaries for self-driving services",
    "date": "2024-12-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "China’s robotaxi companies should see costs coming down and major cities opening up to their fleets next year, according to the chief executive of the latest start-up to seek more funding for its autonomous driving ambitions.\n\nJames Peng, CEO and founder of Guangzhou-based Pony.ai, said it planned to expand its robotaxi fleet from about 250 to at least 1,000 vehicles in 2025, with lower production costs and larger service areas in the so-called first-tier cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\n“Technological advances will allow us to reduce costs of production by several times,” Peng said in a Financial Times interview, adding that the first-tier cities would “soon” open up significantly, if not entirely, to driverless taxis.\n\nThe founder said this could mean Pony.ai reporting a positive margin for its robotaxi business as soon as next year.\n\nHowever, investors are unconvinced about the sector’s prospects, with the company and its peers all lossmaking. At the end of November, Pony.ai joined a roster of self-driving start-ups going public this year. It raised $452mn in a Nasdaq offering and through private placements, but its shares fell nearly 8 per cent upon their New York debut.\n\nThe lacklustre float highlights market scepticism about whether the industry can become commercially viable amid fierce competition, an uncertain policy outlook, heavy spending on research and development and sparse revenues in the short term. In the US, General Motors abandoned the development of its Cruise robotaxi business this month.\n\nThe Nasdaq IPO valued Pony.ai at $5.25bn, nearly 40 per cent lower than the $8.5bn it was worth two years ago. Local peers WeRide and Horizon Robotics saw their valuations fall from previous funding rounds by 22 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, when they sold shares in October.\n\nPony.ai’s driverless taxi services in China’s first-tier cities have been slow to take off due to its small fleet and limited areas of service, covering only a handful of districts. “We don’t have enough users because we don’t have enough robotaxis on the road,” said Peng.\n\nThe company derives more than two-thirds of its revenues — or $27.4mn of $39.5mn in the first nine months of this year — from providing driverless truck services, but Peng said that could change soon, with the start-up partnering with two Chinese state-owned carmakers to “mass produce thousands of” robotaxis a year.\n\nThe initiative will allow Pony.ai to lower production costs to less than Rmb300,000 ($41,000) a car through economies of scale, said Peng. It currently spends more than Rmb500,000 making a driverless taxi, according to people close to the company.\n\nMeanwhile, Peng expects Beijing to allow driverless taxis to roam all suburban districts within the next two years and Guangzhou, a commercial hub, to open up the bulk of the city over the same period.\n\nHis chief technology officer, Lou Tiancheng, said Pony.ai did not plan to target the lower end of the market, where margins are lower and demand is stronger, but was aiming to attract customers “willing to pay a premium price for a better experience”.\n\n“Your first two orders [with us] may be cheap,” he said. “It will not be the case for your future orders.”\n\nLou added that the company could “make a lot of money” when its robotaxi fleet grew to 10,000, an “achievable” target that only accounted for “a very small percentage” of China’s taxi fleets of all varieties.\n\nAnalysts, however, are not convinced. Tu Le, founder of Sino Auto Insights, a Detroit-based consultancy, said he was “impressed” by Pony.ai’s robotaxi after riding it this year, but he was not sure how it could stand out in a market with “immense competition” in which it lagged behind more established peers in everything from capital to fleet size and cost control.\n\n“We still don’t know what is the secret sauce that makes Pony better than everybody else,” said Le.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty could create another hurdle for Pony.ai’s expansion. While major cities are embracing the technology, smaller ones are more cautious. Lou said his company would not consider entering certain cities even after they unveiled policies to encourage self-driving.\n\n“We would love to enter a market with very strong government support,” he said.\n\nChief executive Peng insisted the company was working in a field with “not many” competitors. He said he was not concerned about Tesla’s plan to expand into robotaxis, as the electric vehicle giant had not “invested long enough” in the sector.\n\nHe added that Tesla might face “challenges” in winning regulatory approval to launch its signature semi-autonomous driving service in China.\n\n“It would be a good thing if we let [the driving service] in,” he said. “It is better to have competition.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Gloria Li in Hong Kong",

    "blurb": "Taipei and Washington draw different conclusions over meaning of unannounced military deployment",
    "date": "2024-12-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "A week ago, Taiwan was bracing for a Chinese military exercise to “punish” its president, Lai Ching-te, for a trip abroad that included two short visits to the US. It would have been another show of force from Beijing in retaliation for Taiwanese leaders asserting their country’s independence.\n\nBut what happened next took Taipei by surprise. Its military and national security officials observed what they called the largest Chinese naval deployment in nearly 30 years. At the same time, Beijing announced partial restrictions on air traffic in seven zones hugging its coastline from Shanghai to Hong Kong for two days.\n\nThere was not a word from the People’s Liberation Army, in contrast to the propaganda campaigns which tend to accompany its drills targeting Taipei.\n\nTaiwan and the US — its only foreign defender against China’s threat to annex it by force if Taipei resists unification indefinitely — have drawn drastically different conclusions.\n\nTaiwan’s defence ministry on Monday set up an emergency response centre and held snap readiness drills. “No matter if they have announced drills, the level of the threat to us is severe,” it said.\n\nWashington, however, said that while Chinese military activity in the East and South China Seas was “elevated” following a broader increase over the last several years, it was “consistent” with levels seen during other large exercises. US officials emphasised that they did not see the activity as a response to Lai’s brief visits to Hawaii and Guam.\n\nOne senior US official said it was important to distinguish between a coercion campaign in response to a transit and the kind of “routine large regional exercise” which appeared to have occurred. “They made a choice not to execute a pressure campaign in response to the Lai transit,” the official said.\n\nChina may have decided not to respond specifically to the Lai transit because it was “low profile”, they added. But it was possible Beijing did not want to create turbulence during the US presidential transition, or that the moves were related to political turmoil inside the PLA due to corruption probes.\n\nThe divergent messages highlight the challenge for Taiwan, the US and its allies in assessing China’s intentions and responding to Beijing’s use of its increasingly powerful military in a creeping pressure campaign on several of its neighbours.\n\nObservers said that China could sow confusion and uncertainty among its adversaries by combining unannounced drills with traditional ones. They added that conducting exercises of this scale more regularly would make it harder to spot preparations for an attack on Taiwan.\n\nTaiwanese national security officials said the deployments of the past week involved close to 100 ships, two-thirds from the PLA Navy and one-third from the coastguard. The presence, spread out over the East and South China Seas as well as waters far off Taiwan’s east coast in the western Pacific, was built up over 70 days. China did this in part by keeping ships offshore after smaller patrols and drills in October and November, officials added. Taiwan’s defence ministry said the manoeuvres involved all three of the PLA’s coastal theatre commands for the first time.\n\n“We agree that this went far beyond Taiwan, it is a demonstration that they can lock down the First Island Chain,” said one of the officials, referring to the chain of islands from Japan to the Philippines that separates China from the Pacific Ocean. “But grey zone tactics like this pose a growing threat to us and our neighbours,” he said, referring to military moves below the threshold of war.\n\nThe senior US official said Taiwan may have become overly alarmed because it had more capabilities than in the past to detect what China was doing. The official added that the US had not asked Taiwan to dial back its rhetoric as it recognised Taipei might have domestic political considerations.\n\nTaiwan confirmed this played a role. “We decided to communicate more clearly what we are seeing this time. Especially when China remains silent, the public needs to know what is going on around us,” said one senior official.\n\nA western diplomat said Taipei was trying to “wake up the public” as Lai is scrambling to strengthen the country’s defences. “Making people aware of PLA exercises works better than government demands to increase military readiness.”\n\nThe US official said the exercises highlighted the increasingly expansive nature of the PLA’s manoeuvres further away from the Chinese mainland and later in the year into the winter. The changes also had implications for Japan and the Philippines.\n\n“China has crossed some new line in every of their past exercises,” said a senior Japanese official. “Now they have created another new normal: That they can do manoeuvres of this size without announcement, leaving all of us struggling to respond.”",

    "event_name": "What do investors need to look out for in 2025?",
    "blurb": "The US dominates at FT Money’s annual investment panel — much to some participants’ annoyance  ",
    "date": "2024-12-1400:00:00.0",
    "body": "“What’s bugging me is that everyone is saying the same thing,” says FT markets columnist Katie Martin, wearied by the slew of 2025 outlook reports published by banks and investment houses in recent weeks.\n\n“And essentially it’s ‘American exceptionalism’,” — broadly, that despite Trump’s policies on international trade, tax and migration being inflationary, arguably even fiscally reckless, and despite US stocks being very highly priced, analysts still think the market is the only show in town when it comes to investment.\n\n“Personally, I find that a little bit worrying,” she says. “Because it opens up the possibility that if something goes wrong with this narrative then everyone runs to the other side of the ship all at the same time.”\n\nIn a conference room perched at the top of the FT’s London headquarters, in the shadow of St Paul’s and over a sandwich lunch, the Money section held its annual investment roundtable this week. As usual, there was one item on the agenda: what do retail investors need to look out for next year?\n\nIn answering that question, we discussed Trump’s tariffs; bubbly US stocks; the future of UK equities; and whether, in the week after bitcoin topped $100,000, we could say anything sensible about crypto — all presented here with the usual caveat that this should not be considered financial advice.\n\nJoining Martin on the panel were Alix Stewart, a fund manager on Schroders global unconstrained fixed income team; Salman Ahmed, global head of macro and strategic asset allocation at Fidelity International; and FT Money columnists Simon Edelsten, also the chair of the investment committee at Goshawk Asset Management, and Stuart Kirk.\n\nDonald Trump’s resounding victory in November has shifted the economic outlook for 2025, with many analysts predicting a relatively benign environment for investors.\n\nAccording to his own scenario-based framework, Salman Ahmed submits the most likely outcome is that the US will enter a reflationary period in 2025, characterised by higher consumer spending and improved corporate earnings. His research suggests the next most likely outcome — with a 20 per cent probability — is less benign, with migration and tariff policies producing an inflation shock and a period of stagflation.\n\nWith regards to trade tariffs, Ahmed believes a 60 per cent import tariff rate for China and a 20 per cent rate for the rest of the world is the likely maximalist position — and in some cases, appear to be partly negotiable, with those applied to China, Canada and Mexico linked to their failure to control drugs or illegal immigration to the US.\n\n“The one we have to be careful about is Europe, because we have not heard anything about it,” says Ahmed. “That is not about the border, it is not about drugs, it is pure economics.”\n\nThe history of tariffs between Europe and the US is a long one, says Simon Edelsten, and one that goes both ways. “It is quite easy for us to forget how many tariffs there are for American exports to Europe,” he says — particularly in agriculture, but also cars, steel and other strategic goods.\n\n“That said, as an equity investor, I don’t worry very much about tariffs,” he says. “You hear about a lot, and the number of them that turn up, unless there’s a very good reason, are very few.”\n\nStuart Kirk thinks investors needn’t worry about tariffs in any case. “Look at the markets,” he says. “Investors don’t care: it feels very, very late 90s out there . . . it has that very optimistic feel about it.”\n\nBut how long can it last? Towards the end of 2025, Ahmed predicts that additional tax cuts could expand the US deficit to 8 per cent of GDP — a level of borrowing that bond markets would find unacceptable in other economies. But then, this isn’t any other economy.\n\n“The US has an advantage, which is that it is a deep, liquid market,” says Ahmed. “It can absorb a lot of flows, unlike the UK.” While the leeway afforded will be greater than to other countries, he adds, “where is that limit? That is probably going to be the bond market assessment.”\n\nYields on 10-year Treasuries were growing reasonably quickly since October, up to just shy of 4.5 per cent; but when Scott Bessent was named as Trump’s pick to lead the Treasury department at the end of November — viewed as a relatively sober choice by the markets — yields started to come down.\n\nWhile there is some concern that tariffs will cause inflation to rise in the short term, says Alix Stewart, beyond that expectations haven’t changed much. “So far, there hasn’t been anything that’s allowed the bond vigilantes to get particularly worried about,” she says, referring to those large bond traders who try to influence fiscal policy by selling en masse and causing yields to spike. “[But] we are beginning to get the question marks further out about fiscal sustainability. It’s the elephant in the room that’s there all the time.”\n\nAside from a potential “Liz Truss moment”, another tail risk could be the damage to US institutions. Away from the relatively benign base case consensus of banks and investment houses, Martin says that senior investment officers and portfolio managers have told her that they’re nevertheless concerned about institutional resilience. Take the aforementioned nomination of Bessent, for example:\n\n“He was definitely the best of a series of quite questionable options for that position. And the market’s taken that very well,” she says. “But he’s still the same guy that has been proposing a ‘shadow Fed’. To do what? What could a shadow Fed do other than undermine the actual Fed?”\n\nWhile Trump is limited in what he can do with regards to changing the chair of the Federal Reserve, or the make-up of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets US interest rates, there is what Martin calls a “low-level undermining” that could become a problem, especially regarding dollar policy.\n\n“It’s worth taking those tail risks seriously, because the American exceptionalism story on US equities works only if you have the robust institutions that are there to underpin it. “So growth can be great,” she continues, “Nvidia can be Nvidia, and you can have amazing earnings growth in American companies. But if you pull the rug from under that story by mucking about with the Fed, or by doing something zany with dollar policy, then a lot of that can fall apart quite quickly.”\n\n“I think the market feels more frothy to me with every time I go on social media,” says Kirk. “Every single risk asset’s got this buzzy excitement about it. Everyone’s really, really bullish.”\n\nHe likens it to previous bubbles: “I ran Japanese equity money when everyone was talking about Japanese exceptionalism,” he says. “And this feels very similar; ditto dotcom. And I have to say, it’s not a question of America being exceptional, we know it is for various reasons. It’s how much of that is in the price.”\n\nIn nominal terms, Edelsten says he’s never had so much money in his global equity funds in the US than he has today. “And that’s despite the fact that I completely agree that some of the biggest companies in America are ludicrously expensive.” He cites Apple, the biggest company in the world, but one whose share price trades at 37 times earnings for the current year.\n\nThe question is, he says, how much of that valuation is based on the fundamentals of the company and the belief in its earning potential, and how much is simply a product of the rapid rise of passive investing, which drives up a small number of big shares? “That’s when you can get bubbles,” he concludes.\n\nThere’s another issue that retail investors need to keep in mind, says Kirk, and that’s the difference between absolute and relative returns. For fund managers, relative performance is key — being underweight in a booming market could lose you your job. “[But] for the average mum and dad, you could still make money, in an absolute sense, in Europe next year — even if it underperforms everything else,” he says. “Being underweight in [government bonds] or Europe doesn’t mean your retirement pot is not going to go up.”\n\nThe difficulty is, in the 18 months to two years before the market peaks, it can have incredible growth. “If you’re out for that last little section of it, it can really hurt.”\n\nA gloomy outlook has pervaded the London Stock Exchange for some time, with the valuation gap between the UK and US markets at a record high and a string of high-profile delistings.\n\nNevertheless, for Kirk, the investment case is clear: there are good-value companies, it’s international and “it’s properly Anglo Saxon”, in that management cares about shareholders. What’s more, he says, if you look at return on invested capital, and exclude the top 10 or 20 companies that everyone’s heard of, “there are some spectacularly high-returning, mid- and small-cap companies in the UK — really sexy and cheap”.\n\nIn terms of opportunities, Edelsten suggests that UK banks should have a decent period, so too Experian, the credit checking agency, and RELX, a big beneficiary of AI: “It’s the world leader in providing lawyers with ways of writing legal opinions using computers and then charging a lot for them — so it’s absolutely in a perfect position.”\n\nWhether the Labour Budget will boost UK growth in the new year is up for debate, though. “I’m afraid I have to say, I think the City — including a lot of Labour-voting people in the City — were pretty depressed by the Budget,” says Edelsten. “Many are rather hoping that Rachel Reeves would come back and say: ‘Actually, we’ve got some new stuff.’ I’m not sure they’ve been radical enough, almost, because we would like to see some growth.”\n\nAhmed sees an opportunity in a reset in the relationship between the EU and the UK. “Obviously, they are not going to go back into the EU, but politics is the art of the possible, right? All you have to do is not say ‘Brexit’ and say something else.”\n\nMartin thinks there is a good chance the UK will see a rash of IPOs next year, with the most high profile among them being the Chinese fast-fashion giant, Shein. “And I think for the UK, what’s particularly relevant is that the first one, two, three of these things [IPOs] have got to go well, because, yes, there’s a lot of sophisticated analysis that goes into IPOs, but 80 per cent of it is vibes . . . And if you manage to puncture the vibes with a couple of bad deals from the off, then we’re in trouble.”\n\n“My stance for next year is that actually, although Europe’s quite cheap- looking, the really big gains will come if China gets better,” says Edelsten.\n\nChina certainly has challenges, quite aside from the Trump tariff. There are demographic issues: it has a rapidly ageing population and no longer a rapidly growing workforce. There has also been the huge debt deflation caused by the oversupply of properties. But in September its stock market rallied on the back of a stimulus package and on Monday, Beijing pledged to increase measures to spur growth next year.\n\nEdelsten says that if savers were nervous about investing in Chinese companies directly they could look at Hong Kong stocks, which abide by London Stock Exchange standards. “But you can just buy a lot of European companies, which have been very bad performers because their China business has been poor.” He points to LVMH, the downturn in the luxury sector, weighed down by China’s economic slowdown.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dax is at a record high, says Martin. Rheinmetall, a relatively small European defence company, is up 107 per cent in the year to date — “And why would you not be long European defence right now?” she says.\n\n“My pet theory is that the market is massively underpricing the chance of something good happening in Ukraine,” Martin adds. “Putin’s foreign adventures are falling apart at pace. Trump wants a deal . . . and while no reasonable people want it to just have peace at any cost, the market is assigning basically zero possibility to the chance that something good might happen at some point in 2025. And I think that’s a bit silly.”\n\nOne difference that several around the table picked up on between US and Europe is that where Trump wants to cut taxes, Europe is heading towards fiscal austerity.\n\n“If we’re asking ourselves what Europe might be able to do to make itself investible again, in the short term at least, then [it could be] loosening the fiscal reins a little bit,” says Stewart. “Because it’s certainly not anything that the bond markets are worried about. They’re much more worried about the fact that the recession signs are still looming quite large.”\n\n“Number go up,” says Martin, with a shrug.\n\n“I didn’t expect the number to go up as much as it had, but it has,” she continues. “It still has no core utility to it. It still doesn’t give you a claim on anything useful. But I think those of us who have doubted this thing for the past 15 years have got to accept that there are more buyers than sellers.”\n\nThis time next year, she says, going by total guesswork (because there’s nothing else to go on when determining the price) it could be anywhere from $80,000 to $500,000. “And if the Trump administration goes through with this plan that some are touting for a strategic national reserve of bitcoin, God help us, then there is no upper limit to this thing.”\n\nEdelsten says: “I think one very important thing about the history of bubbles is that they go up in anything from a 45° angle to a 60° angle to an 80° angle. They go down in a 99° angle. And they rely, fatally, on people believing that they’ll get out.”\n\n“If you want to play in that space, go for it,” says Martin. “But just make sure you are able to withstand losing all of that money overnight.”",

    "blurb": "Termination of contracts could shield company from Donald Trump’s incoming US administration",
    "date": "2024-12-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chinese surveillance technology group Hikvision has terminated five contracts with local governments in the north-western region of Xinjiang, a move that could help shield it from pressure from the incoming administration of US president-elect Donald Trump.\n\nTrump’s first administration blacklisted Hikvision in 2019 over its alleged role in facilitating human rights abuses against Xinjiang’s mainly Muslim Uyghur ethnic group.\n\nThe surveillance camera producer said on Friday that the companies set up to handle the five contracts would no longer provide contracted maintenance on them.\n\nBy putting Hikvision on its “entity list” in 2019, Washington barred the group from acquiring US technology. The Biden administration last year added to the list five Hikvision subsidiaries responsible for the Xinjiang projects.\n\nHikvision did not say if it retained any business in Xinjiang or why it had terminated the five projects. In recent financial disclosures, it has cited “constrained” local government finances as an explanation for recent weak financial performance.\n\n“Governments have been hit by one fiscal shock after another”, causing “some projects to shrink significantly”, a Hikvision executive said in a call with analysts in October.\n\nHikvision’s announcement comes as Chinese tech companies are trying to decide how to deal with the incoming Trump administration, amid mounting concern his hawkish selections for cabinet positions spell even tougher restrictions on them.\n\nChinese high tech companies are fearful Trump could put them on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, which would mean suppliers, customers and banks would risk violating US sanctions by doing business with them.\n\nTrump has tapped ardent Hikvision critic Marco Rubio as his incoming administration’s secretary of state.\n\nRubio has led the charge against Hikvision, security camera company Dahua Technology and SenseTime, a Chinese artificial intelligence business that specialises in facial recognition, saying they “pose national security dangers to the United States or are complicit in the Communist party’s build-up of its Orwellian surveillance state” in Xinjiang.\n\nHikvision’s exit from the projects could be politically sensitive in China, where international companies that have reduced their involvement in Xinjiang have suffered a nationalist backlash.\n\nThe Chinese government denies accusations of widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang and in September threatened to put the US parent company of clothing brand Calvin Klein on a national security blacklist for allegedly boycotting cotton from the region.\n\nHikvision’s announcement also highlights the financial difficulties of Chinese local governments, many of which are experiencing fiscal shortfalls due to falling revenues from land sales at a time when they are still reeling from the cost of mass testing and quarantines imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.Based on similar deals with local governments, the combined value of the five Xinjiang contracts is likely to be in the low hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nHikvision guaranteed loans taken out by its five Xinjiang subsidiaries to finance the projects, potentially leaving the company saddled with large bad debts. However, the company said the contract terminations did not “materially impact our business operations and financial condition”.\n\nHikvision and SenseTime have been seeking to reduce their reliance on revenue from government contracts.\n\nHikvision has sought to sell automated manufacturing solutions to factories, while earlier this month SenseTime announced a restructuring to focus on generative AI as its “core business”.\n\nSenseTime’s revenues from its “traditional AI” business, which includes selling surveillance equipment to local governments, fell over 50 per cent in the first half of the year to Rmb520mn ($71.5mn).",

    "date": "2024-12-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The gap between the US and China’s borrowing costs has grown to its widest level in more than a decade, in a sign of the sharp divergence in the bond market’s expectations for the world’s two largest economies.\n\nYields on China’s benchmark 10-year government bonds fell 0.05 percentage points to 1.77 per cent on Friday, a new record low following a signal by Beijing that it could lower interest rates. US 10-year bond yields were, meanwhile, up marginally at 4.33 per cent. Yields fall as prices rise.\n\nThat widened the gap between the two to more than 2.5 percentage points — the biggest since at least 2011, according to LSEG data. The move reflects concern that China’s economy has entered a deflationary spiral and the belief that US President-elect Donald Trump will enact aggressive fiscal measures to boost the US economy, which could increase its deficit.\n\n“This is the result of US-China decoupling,” said Ju Wang, head of China FX and rates at BNP Paribas, adding that the diverging economic performance of the two countries was partially explained by deglobalisation.\n\nThe yield differential also piles further pressure on the Chinese renminbi, which has been weakening due to the country’s economic slowdown and the renewed threat of a trade war with the US under Trump.\n\nA weaker renminbi could add to tensions with the incoming US president. Trump administration figures have previously labelled China a “currency manipulator”.\n\nThe Chinese currency has fallen further in recent days after Reuters reported, citing sources, that Beijing was considering letting its currency devalue further to defend its exporters. The onshore renminbi is at 7.28 to the dollar, compared with 7.10 on November 5 — the date of the US presidential election.\n\nThe lower yields come after Chinese Communist party officials pledged “vigorous” efforts to boost domestic consumption and lower interest rates to revive the economy.\n\nLonger-dated Chinese yields also fell on Friday, with the 30-year yield down 0.04 percentage points at 2.01 per cent. The two-year yield fell 0.05 percentage points to 1.18 per cent.\n\n“The big picture is that China is adopting a low inflation [economic] model . . . while the US is adopting a looser fiscal policy,” said BNP’s Wang, adding that China’s 10-year yield could fall as low as 1.5 per cent by the end of next year.\n\nThe rally in Chinese government bonds has come as investors look for havens amid a long-running sell-off in the stock market.\n\nThe Communist party’s politburo, which is led by Xi Jinping, changed its monetary policy stance on Monday to “moderately loose” from “prudent” for the first time in 14 years, in another sign that Beijing is looking to act to stimulate growth.",

    "blurb": "Beijing-based company has lured top AI talent from local rivals while becoming China’s biggest buyer of Nvidia chips",
    "date": "2024-12-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "TikTok-owner ByteDance has emerged as an early frontrunner in the race to capitalise on generative artificial intelligence in China, poaching top talent from local rivals and becoming Nvidia’s biggest customer in the country.\n\nThe Beijing-based company has lured top AI engineers and researchers away from Alibaba and start-ups such as 01.ai and Zhipu in recent months, according to multiple people with knowledge of the hiring spree. It has also created and expanded teams to work on its large language models and AI products.\n\nByteDance is ploughing billions of dollars into AI infrastructure. In the past two years, it has purchased enough cutting-edge Nvidia graphics processing units to build advanced AI models, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe effort, led by Zhang Yiming, ByteDance founder and China’s richest man, comes at a critical moment. While the private company was valued at around $300bn in a recent share buyback programme for investors, growth for Douyin, the local sister app to TikTok, has hit a saturation point in China. Meanwhile, there are also signs growth has slowed for TikTok in key markets. In another blow, a US court on Friday upheld a law that requires ByteDance to sell the platform by January or face a ban in the country.\n\n“[Zhang] Yiming realised the potential for large language models to change the industry, and he decided to go all in,” said one company insider.\n\nKey to its AI expansion is its close commercial relationship to Nvidia. ByteDance can only buy Nvidia’s H20s for Chinese data centres, a specialised and less-powerful version of its GPUs tailored to align with US export controls.\n\nBut ByteDance could buy top-of-the-range H100s and Blackwell chips for data centres outside of the country until last year. That has led ByteDance to increase its computing capacity outside China, including signing on as the anchor tenant for new data centres in Malaysia. The company said: “ByteDance is not allowed to buy and has not bought H100s and Blackwell chips for data centres outside of the US since relevant US export control rules took effect on November 17th, 2023.”\n\nPeople with knowledge of the matter said ByteDance is already Nvidia’s largest customer in China, with one of these people adding it has become the company’s biggest buyer in Asia.\n\nTan Dai, the chief of Volcano Engine, ByteDance’s cloud computing arm, had an audience with Nvidia chief Jensen Huang in California earlier this year, underscoring the importance of the company to sales in Asia, one of these people said.\n\nByteDance and Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nThe release of OpenAI’s chatbot galvanised a race by Chinese tech giants, including Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, into generative AI — in what had previously been an under-developed field in China. While there is no definitive frontrunner in China’s efforts to develop the most advanced LLM, ByteDance, alongside rivals DeepSeek and Alibaba, has been pushing out more capable models and slashing costs for developers.\n\nBut ByteDance has secured the lead in developing China’s most popular AI app, with its AI chatbot Doubao emerging as the best challenger to ChatGPT in China. It released Doubao in August 2023, five months after Baidu’s Ernie Bot, but has since become the country’s most popular AI application, according to website analytics site Aicpb.com.\n\nBy November, Doubao had 60mn regular monthly active mobile users, compared to nearly 13mn for Wenxiaoyan, the rebranded mobile version of Baidu’s Ernie Bot. However, OpenAI said it has 300mn weekly active users globally.\n\n“The key differentiator of ByteDance’s Doubao is that it brings together multiple AI capabilities in one polished application,” said Wang Tiezhen, an engineer at machine learning platform Hugging Face, pointing to the chatbot’s search, translation, image and video generation capabilities.\n\nByteDance has also launched an overseas chatbot, Cici AI, which is powered by third party models including OpenAI’s GPT. Zhang, who stepped back as chief executive in 2021, has remained active in the group’s AI strategy, according to multiple company insiders.\n\nHe has personally overseen the hiring of Chinese AI engineers and researchers from rival companies, these people said. The billionaire has spoken internally of his aim of “artificial general intelligence”, systems with humanlike intelligence.\n\n“[Zhang] Yiming is hyper-focused on achieving AGI,” said one company insider in a reference to “artificial general intelligence, or when computer software surpasses human cognitive abilities. Another person close to Zhang said he is reluctant for ByteDance to be seen as an AI company, given the risk of courting increased scrutiny from Washington.\n\nSome industry insiders are sceptical of the goal after the company made several failed big bets on future technological development. He previously made huge investments in gaming, virtual reality and online education, all of which ByteDance ploughed billions of dollars into, only to shut down or sell off their investments.\n\n“This is not the first time [Zhang] Yiming has bet big on the next technology,” said one executive at a rival AI company in China. “We’ll see how long this bet lasts.”\n\nByteDance also has a team working on an AI chip after poaching leading talent from rival Chinese chip firms.\n\nThe team is building an AI accelerator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) — a specialised AI chip for machine learning, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIts efforts are modelled on Google’s Tensor Processing Unit, a self-developed ASIC that the internet giant hopes will wean its dependence on Nvidia chips for AI training and inference. Reuters and The Information have previously reported about ByteDance’s AI chip effort.\n\nIn 2017, ByteDance built an AI lab that brought in leaders from Microsoft Research Asia, the leading research facility in China at the time. ByteDance’s lab included a team working on LLMs, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\n“There was no clear pathway for the technology at the time, and the project was shut down,” said one executive.\n\nByteDance has since pursued strategies for model development to align with US and Chinese restrictions, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. It has trained separate models — one for the Chinese market called Doubao and another targeting overseas, called Cici — based on the same algorithm but using different data sets.\n\nNevertheless, there are overlaps. Zhu Wenjia, the tech executive behind the recommendation algorithm that powered ByteDance’s first breakout product, the news aggregator Toutiao — has been put in charge of its AI model development. Both the overseas and Chinese members of the so-called “Seed Team” working on model development report to Zhu, while there are researchers in the US that work alongside colleagues in Singapore and Beijing on its models, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nFurthermore, the team in Beijing can remotely monitor and control the Cici model training progress outside of China.\n\n“[Zhang] Yiming can see that ByteDance needs a new growth engine after Douyin and TikTok,” said one person close to Zhang. “He is always thinking about what is coming in the next five years, what can extend the company’s future.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Wenjie Ding in Beijing This article has been amended since first publication to clarify the period the company could buy high-end Nvidia chips outside China and to include a statement from ByteDance.",

    "date": "2024-12-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "A further build-up of US nuclear capabilities would have little effect on whether China might resort to using nuclear weapons in a war over Taiwan, the first large-scale unclassified war game on such a scenario has found.\n\nA growing number of US experts have recommended Washington acquire more nuclear capabilities, possibly including new tactical weapons, in a sign of an incipient nuclear arms race with Beijing.\n\nBut the tabletop exercise, conducted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies and a war gaming lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, suggested a build-up beyond current modernisation plans would not strengthen nuclear deterrence in a conflict over Taiwan.\n\nThe war game did not seek to assess how likely it was for China or the US to resort to nuclear weapons, but examined which military situations might make either Chinese or American battlefield commanders seek their use in a hypothetical Taiwan war in 2028 and how that would change its further course.\n\nWar games of this type mainly test strategies and capabilities by having teams of military officers, government officials or experts simulate conflicts by acting as opposing parties using computer models, gameboards and discussions.\n\nThe CSIS and MIT war game was conducted amid debate over how Washington should react to the modernisation and expansion of China’s nuclear forces, discussion that has been fuelled by fear of possible joint military action with Russia and by Moscow’s nuclear posturing over the Ukraine war.\n\nFor decades, China focused on securing the ability to retaliate against any enemy nuclear strike, without seeking parity with the world’s two leading nuclear powers.\n\nHowever, the Pentagon estimates that Beijing will by 2030 double its arsenal of operational warheads from more than 500 last year. Other experts put the number at about 440. The People’s Liberation Army can also now launch nuclear weapons from submarines as well as aircraft, road-mobile vehicles and missile silos.\n\nUS experts have argued that increasing nuclear capabilities could make up for a potential shortfall in conventional munitions. They have suggested the deployment of new tactical nuclear weapons that could target enemy forces on the battlefield, possibly including nuclear-armed submarine-launched cruise missiles (SLCM-N), a type of weapon the US withdrew at the end of the cold war.\n\nHowever, the multiple iterations of the war game suggested such capabilities were not needed.\n\n“The US has 600-plus tactical nuclear weapons, and it is modernising their delivery means,” said Eric Heginbotham, an expert on Chinese nuclear issues at MIT and one of the report authors.\n\n“In the game, the one US team that employed tactical nuclear weapons used fewer than a dozen,” Heginbotham said. “In no cases did any of the participants ever say: ‘We need SLCM-N or some other system that is not in the inventory or being deployed under the current modernisation plan.’”\n\nCSIS and MIT said that when deciding on whether to use nuclear weapons, teams playing China had not perceived any constraints on the US ability to itself deliver such weapons.\n\nThe authors concluded that US policymakers should not “develop additional nuclear weapons for a conflict with China beyond current nuclear modernisation plans” and “not pursue quantitative nuclear superiority in the expectation that it would deter China from using nuclear weapons”.\n\nIn the multiple iterations of the war game, the greatest pressure for nuclear use came when teams playing China faced defeat in their invasion of Taiwan, underlining US concerns that Beijing may be watering down its pledge to never use nuclear weapons first. The exercise also indicated that escalation paths for a conflict gone nuclear were unpredictable.\n\n“Favourable outcomes were possible, but total victory was unachievable,” CSIS and MIT said in their report.\n\nThe results differed starkly from simulations of a conventional Taiwan conflict published by CSIS last year that did not give either side the option to use nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile that exercise pointed to a decisive US victory as the most likely result, only five of 15 iterations of the nuclear game ended with a withdrawal of the PLA. Four of those were cases where neither side used nuclear weapons.\n\nA US team was first to use nuclear weapons in only one iteration.\n\nIn one iteration, Taiwan returned to its prewar status after the US hit PLA forces on the island with tactical nuclear weapons following Chinese nuclear strikes on Taiwanese troops. Three other iterations led to the nuclear annihilation of Chinese and US cities, claiming hundreds of millions of lives. This happened after one side retaliated with strikes on the other’s homeland following initial nuclear attacks on its own forces.\n\nFive more iterations ended with a PLA foothold on Taiwan after nuclear weapons were used. One iteration remained inconclusive.\n\nThe authors urged the US to work with allies and partners to evaluate what concessions could be offered during a Taiwan war to allow China to back down instead of resorting to a nuclear option.\n\nThere were “many examples” of past crises being settled with such “off-ramps”, said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Defense and Security Department at CSIS and another co-author.\n\nAs part of the resolution to the Cuban missile crisis, “the United States secretly agreed to withdraw its nuclear missiles from Turkey”, noted Cancian. “That gave [Nikita] Khrushchev a face-saving win, but it didn’t cost the United States very much.\n\n“In that situation, there was time to develop an off-ramp,” he added. “Our concern is that time will not be available when nuclear weapons are used. That’s why it’s important to think through off-ramps ahead of time.”\n\nChina has repeatedly dismissed US concern about the development of its nuclear forces, saying Washington uses it as a pretext to expand its own nuclear arsenal in pursuit of “absolute strategic predominance”.\n\n“It is the US who is the primary source of nuclear threats and strategic risks in the world,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in August.\n\nData visualisation by Aditi Bhandari and Ian Bott",

    "blurb": "Readout from key policy meeting indicates government’s realisation of economic challenge",
    "date": "2024-12-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Xi Jinping’s Communist party has shifted its economic focus to stoking domestic demand, switching its priority away from investing in the technology and industry that have helped China become an export powerhouse.\n\nEmerging from their annual economic conference this week, party leaders spoke of the need for “vigorous” efforts to boost consumption and domestic demand “in all directions”, promising to fund this by expanding China’s budget deficit.\n\nIn a work report emphasising consumption as the first of nine economic priorities for 2025, above Xi’s previous strategic aims such as investment in so-called “new productive forces”, they gave a clear indication of Beijing’s concern about growth next year.\n\nThe focus on consumption is “a better-case scenario for how the conference could have gone in terms of the macro signals it’s sending out”, said Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.\n\n“Xi’s not giving up on his other economic and political goals, but I think he does realise that he needs to maintain a baseline of economic growth to ensure that his broader national rejuvenation agenda can keep moving forward.”\n\nChina’s economy is wrestling with low domestic demand and deep deflationary pressures following a three-year slump in the property market that has hit household wealth.\n\nThe exports that have powered the economy face the threat of more tariffs from incoming US president Donald Trump.\n\nStill, the lack of detail after the two-day meeting known as the Central Economic Work Conference has left markets wondering what “vigorously” promoting consumption might mean — particularly given Communist party leaders’ distaste for western-style social welfare and fiscal stimulus measures.\n\nDetails of measures would probably only be released at China’s annual meeting of its rubber-stamp parliament in March next year, wrote Ting Lu, Nomura’s chief China economist.\n\nChina’s leaders have gradually changed their tone in favour of spurring consumption. In September, financial regulators announced monetary stimulus targeting stocks and real estate. The finance ministry followed this up with a Rmb10tn ($1.4tn) debt swap for China’s heavily leveraged local governments.\n\nBut to the disappointment of markets, Beijing has yet to announce any concerted fiscal stimulus, and China’s blue-chip CSI 300 index has fallen almost 12 per cent since a peak on October 8 following Beijing’s initial announcement of stimulus plans.\n\nMeanwhile, a blistering rally in its sovereign bonds continues, driving the benchmark 10-year yield down as far as 1.77 per cent — a record low that underlines investor concerns over growth prospects.\n\nIn 2008, China did unleash a Rmb4tn stimulus package that helped pull the world economy out of the downturn caused by the global financial crisis. But that stimulus, which would need to be several times larger today to have the same effect given China’s bigger economy, was mainly ploughed into large-scale infrastructure projects.\n\nEconomists believe a similar programme would not have an equally impressive impact now given the vast amounts already invested in infrastructure.\n\nThey argue what is needed is large-scale investment in areas such as pensions and healthcare to give households the confidence to be able to consume now, rather than save for the future.\n\nChina’s households have some of the world’s highest savings rates, partly because of the need to save for health emergencies and the lack of sufficient pensions, according to economists.\n\nA government policy adviser told the Financial Times that officials were probably looking at channelling money to households via measures that could include expanding the coverage of health insurance schemes and their levels of reimbursement. At present, families have to pay significant amounts out of pocket for chronic health problems.\n\nThe government could also expand funding for education and the number of years of free education, the adviser said.\n\nThe work conference readout identified these areas as priorities, saying authorities should “appropriately raise the basic pension for retirees, increase the basic pension for urban and rural residents, and raise the financial subsidy standards for urban and rural residents’ medical insurance”.\n\nOverall, economists said they expected more subsidies for upgrading goods such as electronics and vehicles.\n\nBeijing also seems set to use more monetary levers. Policymakers set achieving a “reasonable rebound” of inflation as a target, noted Tao Wang, chief China economist at UBS, suggesting more interest rate cuts and monetary easing are likely.\n\nChina’s producers have been facing deflationary pressures for two years as high competition and low demand depress prices.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists forecast in a note that the country’s “augmented fiscal deficit” — their estimate of the total budget deficit including central and local governments — would widen by 1.8 percentage points to 13 per cent of GDP next year, “implying fiscal policy will do most of the heavy lifting to stabilise growth”.\n\nMorgan Stanley economists said they expected “a marginal increase in social welfare spending” and cautioned over trade headwinds. They said they would maintain a “below-consensus” forecast for China’s nominal GDP growth of 3 per cent year on year.\n\nWhile the party’s economic meeting emphasised consumption, it offered little new on the crisis in the country’s housing market — which many economists view as the ultimate source of the confidence crisis afflicting China’s households.\n\nThe Asia Society’s Thomas said the focus leading up to the National People’s Congress meeting in March would be whether the party would turn its promises of stimulus into action.\n\n“They’re talking the talk, but the big question is whether they’re going to walk the walk,” Thomas said, cautioning that Xi’s focus would be “trying to balance short-term growth stabilisation with his longer-term economic agendas”.\n\nThese included reducing debt, improving social stability and securing strategic technological goals, Thomas said — areas “that aren’t always growth positive”.\n\nAdditional reporting by Wenjie Ding in Beijing",

    "body": "The writer is a faculty member at Yale, formerly chair of Morgan Stanley Asia, and is the author of ‘Accidental Conflict: America, China, and the Clash of False Narratives’\n\nA tit-for-tat between China and the US on trade this month hints at what could well lie ahead if Donald Trump delivers on campaign promises to up the ante on Chinese tariffs when he returns to the White House.\n\nIn a long overdue move, the US has just updated its export sanctions on China, focusing on high-bandwidth memory chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Washington also added another 140 Chinese companies to the commerce department’s so-called “entity list”, effectively making it very difficult for those US companies to supply technology to them.\n\nAs has been the case since 2018, China has been quick to counterpunch, in this case by banning or limiting US purchases of several critical minerals while tightening controls on graphite. China’s retaliatory action is a surgical strike with important strategic consequences for key US industries, ranging from semiconductors and satellites to infrared technology and fibre optic cables, to lithium batteries and solar cells. These actions are comparable to what Washington is seeking with its “small yard, high fence” strategy aimed at restricting access to critical US technologies.\n\nIt is a reminder that retaliation is the high-octane fuel of conflict escalation. This is not well understood in US policy circles that seem to harbour the mistaken notion of a one-way dependency — that China is uniquely beholden to external demand and new technologies from the US. This leaves out the other half of the equation. The US is also heavily reliant on low-cost Chinese goods to make ends meet for income-constrained consumers; the US needs Chinese surplus saving to help fill its void of domestic saving; and US producers rely on China as America’s third-largest export market. This codependency means the US depends on China just as much China depends on America.\n\nTrump doesn’t buy this logic. During Trump 1.0, US tariffs on Chinese products were raised from 3 per cent in 2016 to 19 per cent by 2020. Trump held the mistaken view that there was a bilateral China fix for a multilateral trade deficit with 106 countries.\n\nThat backfired. Over the subsequent years, the overall US merchandise trade deficit widened from $879bn 2018 to $1.06tn in 2023. Predictably, in response to tariffs, the Chinese share of the overall US trade deficit fell from 47 to 26 per cent over this same five-year period.\n\nHowever, the Chinese portion was simply diverted to Mexico, Vietnam, Canada, Korea, Taiwan, India, Ireland and Germany. And it turns out more than 70 per cent of the trade diversion away from China went to higher-cost or comparable-cost nations, underscoring that trade diversion is the equivalent of a tax rise on US companies and consumers.\n\nExpect more of the same in a second Trump administration. And as US actions escalate, retaliation from China will probably broaden. For example, China’s latest actions on critical minerals open up the possibility of wide-ranging constraints on rare earths, which are of enormous strategic importance to the US.\n\nThen, of course, there is the ultimate financial weapon — Greater China’s $1tn in direct holdings of US Treasury securities (including $772bn by the PRC and $233bn by Hong Kong as of September 2024). Cavalier Americans typically dismiss this possibility, claiming China wouldn’t dare flirt with this nuclear option because it would hurt them more than us.\n\nOh really? There are a couple of “bad dream” options to consider: China could go on a buyer’s strike during upcoming Treasury auctions, or, even more extreme, it could start to unload its outsize position as America’s second-largest foreign creditor. Either option would be devastating for America’s deficit-prone economy and would unleash havoc in the US bond market, with wrenching collateral damage in world financial markets. While it seems far-fetched, almost suicidal, for China to spark such a financial meltdown, it is equally reckless to dismiss the “tail risk” consequences of a trapped adversary.\n\nMuch of the post-election policy discussion has focused on tariff initiatives likely to be forthcoming in Trump 2.0. Sino-American codependency urges us to think less about unilateral actions and more about the retaliatory responses to those actions. Trump’s nationalistic view of “America First” ignores how much a saving-short US economy depends on China for goods and financial capital. China has plenty of “Trump cards” to send a very different message.",
