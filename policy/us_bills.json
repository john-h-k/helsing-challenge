United States that Japanese incarceration was a ‘‘military necessity’’ rather than an egregious act of racial discrimination; \nWhereas, in 1980, President Jimmy Carter created the Com-\nmission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civil-ians (CWRIC), which concluded in 1983 that the forced removal and imprisonment of people of Japanese ancestry was motivated by ‘‘race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership’’; \nWhereas, during this time, researchers at the University of \nCalifornia, San Diego uncovered documents from the United States Department of Justice in which intel-ligence agencies, including the FBI, the FCC, and the Office of Naval Intelligence, denied that Japanese-Ameri-cans ever committed wrongdoing, but which were never presented to the United States Supreme Court during Korematsu v. United States; \nWhereas, following the conclusion of the Commission on War-\ntime Relocation and Internment of Civilians and the find-ings on governmental misconduct, Fred Korematsu re-opened his case, and on November 10, 1983, the United States District Court of Northern California in San Francisco overturned his conviction; \nWhereas Fred Korematsu’s courageously fought injustice by \nchallenging the constitutionality of Executive Order 9066, and his lawsuit remains an important lesson about \nVerDate Sep 11 2014 23:36 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 059200 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 6652 Sfmt 6300 E:\\BILLS\\HR77.IH HR77kjohnson on DSK7ZCZBW3PROD with $$_JOB\n3 \n•HRES 77 IH the fragility of individual civil liberties during a time \nwhen the Nation is experiencing threats to its national security; \nWhereas Fred Korematsu continued to fight injustice and de-\nfend the liberties of Muslim people when, in 2003, he warned in an amicus brief that the United States ex-treme national security measures following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were reminiscent of the mistakes of the past that undermined American civil lib-erties, including the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War, the prosecution of dissenters during World War I, the Red Scare of 1919–1920, the interment of people of Japanese descent during World War II, and the era of loyalty oaths and McCarthyism during the Cold War; \nWhereas the democratic character of the American people will \nbe nourished and enhanced by opportunities for civic edu-cation on the significant challenges that have been posed to our Constitution; \nWhereas a day of annual national reflection on how the Fred \nKorematsu quest for justice is important to educating the American people about preserving civil liberties and the principle of equality before the law; and \nWhereas the States of California, Florida, Hawaii, Virginia, \nArizona, New Jersey, and Michigan have already des-ignated January 30 as Fred Korematsu Day to com-memorate his lifelong fight for civil liberties and the Con-stitution: Now, therefore, be it \nResolved, That the House of Representatives— 1\nVerDate Sep 11 2014 23:36 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 059200 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 6652 Sfmt 6201 E:\\BILLS\\HR77.IH HR77kjohnson on DSK7ZCZBW3PROD with $$_JOB\n4 \n•HRES 77 IH (1) supports the designation of a ‘‘Fred 1\nKorematsu Day of Civil Liberties and the Constitu- 2\ntion’’; 3\n(2) recognizes Fred Korematsu’s bravery and 4\nresilience in the face of adversity; and 5\n(3) encourages all people to reflect on the im- 6\nportance of political leadership and vigilance and on 7\nthe values of justice and civil rights during times of 8\nuncertainty and emergency. 9\nÆ \nVerDate Sep 11 2014 23:36 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 059200 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 6652 Sfmt 6301 E:\\BILLS\\HR77.IH HR77kjohnson on DSK7ZCZBW3PROD with $$_JOB",

\n(6) 59 percent of rural counties are considered a \nmaternity care desert; \n(7) rural counties with more Black and Hispanic \nresidents and lower median incomes are less likely to have access to hospital obstetric services; \n(8) the average travel distance for maternity care \ndeserts and rural counties is 28.1 and 17.3 miles, respec-tively; and \n(9) American Indian and Alaska Native women liv-\ning in rural communities are more than twice as likely as their White counterparts to report receiving late or no prenatal care;

\nWhereas the defense and operation of the Panama Canal dur-\ning the 20th century further demonstrated the United States’ commitment, at significant financial and human cost, to maintaining the vital global trade route; \nWhereas the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality \nand Operation of the Panama Canal, signed at Wash-ington September 7, 1977 (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Neutrality Treaty’’), prohibits actions that undermine the canal’s neutrality or threaten United States security interests and grants the United States the right to act, unilaterally if necessary, to defend the canal’s neutrality and ensure its operational security; \nWhereas the Neutrality Treaty obligates Panama and the \nUnited States to act against any threat to the neutrality or peaceful operation of the Panama Canal, including undue foreign control over its infrastructure or manage-ment;

\nWhereas the involvement of Chinese government-affiliated en-\nterprises in the construction, management, and mainte-nance of other critical infrastructure, such as a proposed fourth bridge spanning the Panama Canal, calls into question the ability of Panama and the United States to defend the canal’s neutrality and ensure its operational security; \nWhereas two major ports in Panama, the ports of Balboa and \nCristobal, are currently managed by Chinese-affiliated en-tities, such as Hutchison Ports, a Hong Kong-based op-erator with significant ties to China’s economic and polit-ical ecosystem, threatening the sovereignty of Panama and the security of the Western Hemisphere;

\nWhereas the Parthenon is the ultimate expression of the ar-\ntistic genius of Greece, the preeminent symbol of the Greek cultural heritage, including its art, architecture, and democracy, and of the contributions that modern Greeks and their forefathers have made to civilization;

\nWhereas over 100 pieces of the Parthenon’s sculptures, now \nknown as the Parthenon Marbles, were removed from the Parthenon under questionable circumstances between 1801 and 1816 by British nobleman Thomas Bruce, sev-enth Earl of Elgin, while Greece was still under Ottoman rule; \nWhereas the removal of the Parthenon Marbles, including \ntheir perilous voyage to Great Britain and their careless storage there for many years, greatly endangered the Marbles; \nWhereas the Parthenon Marbles were removed to grace the \nprivate home of Lord Elgin, who transferred the Marbles to the British Museum only after severe personal eco-nomic misfortunes; \nWhereas the sculptures of the Parthenon were designed as an \nintegral part of the structure of the Parthenon temple, the carvings of the friezes, pediments, and metopes are not merely statuary, movable decorative art, but are inte-gral arts of the Parthenon, which can best be appreciated if all the Parthenon Marbles are reunified; \nWhereas the Parthenon is a universal symbol of culture, de-\nmocracy, and freedom, making the Parthenon Marbles of concern not only to Greece but to all the world; \nWhereas, since obtaining independence in 1830, Greece has \nsought the return of the Parthenon Marbles;

\nWhereas the United Kingdom should return the Parthenon \nMarbles in recognition that the Parthenon is part of the cultural heritage of the entire world and, as such, should be made whole; \nWhereas Greece would provide care for the Parthenon Mar-\nbles equal or superior to the care provided by the British Museum, especially considering the irreparable harm caused by attempts by the museum to remove the original color and patina of the Marbles with abrasive cleaners; \nWhereas Greece opened the New Acropolis Museum in 2009 \nwhich houses the Marbles that were not removed to the United Kingdom by Lord Elgin and displays them along-side plaster replicas of the Marbles currently in the Brit-ish Museum so visitors can see the entire frieze as it was designed around the Temple of Athena; \nWhereas it has been 200 years since the British Government \nvoted to purchase the Marbles; \nWhereas the Greek Government has publicly supported work-\ning with the British Government in a diplomatic manner to negotiate mutually agreeable conditions for the return of the Parthenon Marbles;
