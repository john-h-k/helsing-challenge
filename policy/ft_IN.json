She said that the government would introduce a new income tax bill next week.\n\nThe finance minister added that the new rates would \u201csubstantially reduce the taxes of the middle class and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, savings and investment\u201d, as ruling coalition MPs chanted \u201cModi, Modi\u201d.\n\nAmong measures meant to make doing business easier, Sitharaman said a high-level committee for regulatory reforms that would review India\u2019s rules, certifications, licences, and permissions governing business as well as the creation of an investment friendliness index of states, would be launched this year.\n\n\u201cA light touch regulatory framework based on principles and trust will unleash productivity and employment,\u201d Sitharaman said.\n\nBusiness groups have long urged India to reduce onerous paperwork and compliance burdens and reform the rules governing labour and land markets to stimulate investment and create jobs.\n\n\u201cThe focus of the budget has, basically, come in consumption via taxation cuts to support lower income and middle income segments of society, because that\u2019s where the pain point has been very visible,\u201d said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services in Mumbai.\n\nIndia has bounced back since the Covid-19 pandemic and remains the world\u2019s fastest-growing big economy, but GDP growth in the second fiscal quarter that ended in September was 5.4 per cent, the slowest in nearly two years.\n\nDespite strong infrastructure spending by the state, private investment has been sluggish and job creation weak. Inflation has been trending near the top of the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s mandated band of 4-6 per cent, limiting its scope to cut lending rates.\n\nVijayaraghavan Swaminathan, head of research at Avendus Spark Institutional Equities in Chennai, said the government\u2019s intent in announcing the tax cuts was \u201cvery clear\u201d and that they would give middle-class households \u201ca breather\u201d.\n\nIn a special trading session on Saturday, India\u2019s benchmark Nifty 50 blue-chip index fell 0.5 per cent, though consumer stocks were buoyed by Sitharaman\u2019s moves to lower income tax pressures.\n\n\u201cThe market is confused as of now,\u201d said Swaminathan. \u201cA lot of numbers remain to be seen, including how the government is going to accommodate this tax collection hit.\u201d\n\nIn India\u2019s annual Economic Survey, published by the government on Friday, the finance ministry painted a stark picture of the challenges faced by the youth and the economy. These included a reliance on China for supply chains serving critical industries such as solar power, advanced batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nThe report, authored by Modi\u2019s chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, also urged India\u2019s central and state governments to \u201cget out of the way\u201d and deregulate the economy or face a \u201chigh risk of economic growth stagnation, if not economic stagnation\u201d.\n\nThe report forecast real GDP growth of 6.4 per cent for the current fiscal year, down from 8.2 per cent in 2023-4. The government is forecasting growth of 6.3 to 6.8 per cent in the coming 2025-6 fiscal year.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1d76cc7f-0f84-4dbb-9c17-0ecd29eb6340"}}, {"id": "835c15f8-b5cd-426d-aaa4-2a3b4dea01d1", "event_name": "Bimla Bissell, ambassadors\u2019 aide and socialite, 1932-2025", "blurb": "As a mainstay of Delhi high society, she helped expats navigate a rapidly changing India", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Bimla Bissell, the social secretary to US ambassadors to India and legendary hostess, whose personal history tracked the country\u2019s, has died aged 92. Outside of India, Bissell is best known as the animating force behind Fabindia, the textile and clothing brand founded by her American husband John Bissell.\n\nTributes since her death in January have used words like \u201ccatalyst\u201d, \u201cconnector\u201d, and \u201csaloniste\u201d to capture the place she occupied for decades in Delhi at a time when India\u2019s traditionalist society and protected economy were opening to the wider world.\n\nSome remember how Bissell dressed \u2014 elegant saris, bespoke outfits tailored from cotton kurta cloth, silver bangles \u2014 or the food she served. From the 1960s, the Bissells hosted a Christmas brunch attended by as many as 300-400 people that featured western breakfast meats like bacon and sausage alongside southern Indian vegetarian fare like dosas and idli.\n\n\u201cBim was a quintessential Punjabi who had to feed you,\u201d says Poonam Muttreja, a friend. Around the Bissells\u2019 table at their house \u2014 first in South Delhi\u2019s New Friends Colony, then later in Panchsheel Park \u2014 you would find artists and writers seated alongside politicians, diplomats with leftist nongovernmental activists \u2014 a curated but eclectic crowd engaged in sparky debate about India, sometimes for the benefit of prominent foreign visitors passing through town, from architect Buckminster Fuller and John F Kennedy Jr to Jordan\u2019s Princess Firyal.\n\nAt these dinners, Bissell kept two tables at opposite ends of the room, strategically swapping guests between them when the conversation got too hot \u2014 \u201clike putting control rods into a nuclear reactor\u201d says William Bissell, Bimla\u2019s son and managing director of Fabindia, when recalling his mother\u2019s \u201ctwo-table policy\u201d.\n\nBimla Nanda Bissell \u2014 known to friends as Bim \u2014 was born in Quetta, British India, in 1932 (now Pakistan\u2019s Balochistan province) to a father who was a veterinarian. She studied at Sacred Heart Convent School and Kinnaird College in Lahore before her family relocated to Pune and then Delhi in the months before Partition tore apart the subcontinent, when her father became the newly independent India\u2019s husbandry commissioner.\n\nBissell had a brief and unhappy arranged marriage to a government aide. When it failed, she separated from him and went to the US to pursue a masters in education from the University of Michigan \u2014 an unusually independent move for an Indian woman at the time.\n\nAfter returning to India in 1957, Bissell took over a nursery school her sister had founded in Delhi, transforming it into one of the city\u2019s first Montessori schools.\u00a0She also helped to develop the crafts base at the Central Cottage Industries Corp, a clearing house for traditional handicrafts and handloom textiles. The following year she met John Bissell, who was advising Indian craftspeople on a grant from the Ford Foundation. In a 2011 interview with The Hindu Business Line, she recalls her colleague saying to her, \u201cHe won\u2019t last long, will you please give [him] your room for the time being?\u201d\n\nThe couple wed five years later in the backyard of then-US ambassador Chester Bowles, a friend of John\u2019s parents. By then, Bimla was working as a social secretary for US envoys, having first taken the role for Bowles\u2019 predecessor John Kenneth Galbraith in 1961. (She would work for four, including Daniel Patrick Moynihan.) That same year, her husband founded Fabindia, though Bimla was crucial in forging contacts with artisans.\n\nThe brand found\u00a0a market with its traditional saris, Nehru jackets and kurta pyjamas, bringing traditional styles and homespun fabrics into the present with bright colours and modern marketing.\n\nIn her role at Delhi\u2019s US embassy, Bissell was key in shaping the ambassadors\u2019 understanding of India at a time when the country leaned heavily toward the Soviet Union \u2014 Washington and Delhi had frequently testy ties. She played a similar role at the World Bank as external affairs officer for 21 years from 1975, helping the organisation\u2019s expat staffers to navigate India but also introducing Indians to a multilateral institution they viewed with suspicion. \u201cShe was good at brokering \u2014 not having things escalate by bringing people to the table for dialogue,\u201d her daughter Monsoon Bissell remembers.\n\nJohn Bissell died in 1998, but Bimla remained a mentor to some, connector of many, and informal gatekeeper for prominent visitors to India. At one dinner in the mid-2010s, after the publication of The Blood Telegram, Gary J Bass\u2019 book about the 1971 birth of Bangladesh which presented Richard Nixon\u2019s India policy in a deeply unflattering light, Bissell\u2019s children remember Henry Kissinger being grilled bluntly by other guests, but gamely fielding the questions.\n\nAccording to Monsoon, when someone once approached her mother about writing a memoir, she replied: \u201cThat I can\u2019t do because these stories belong to other people\u201d.\u00a0Her parents, she says, \u201chad a front row seat on a changing world where they were both committed to making it easier for everyone around them\u201d.\u00a0\u201cMy mother showed up, always, no matter the circumstances, and never said no if she could help someone out,\u201d Monsoon says. \u201cThat\u2019s a dying art.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e1ade26f-bd0e-4c28-b6bf-15316319c634"}}, {"id": "9e570ede-ac9d-4715-b530-46e0494273bb", "event_name": "Gauri Gill\u2019s photographs of the Indian farmers\u2019 protests", "blurb": "The artist was drawn to the ingenuity and beauty of the year-long Delhi blockades", "date": "2025-02-0100:00:00.0", "body": "Cauliflower plants stand in orderly rows across a patch of freshly tilled soil. Not yet in bloom, the garden is bordered by colourful tarpaulins, as if to shield the buds from wandering cattle. On one end, a low concrete boundary has been built, a subtle assertion of ownership. A water container rests serenely on a stone platform. Beyond the polyester divider, a bamboo hut peeks into view, its slanting roof also padded with tarpaulin. Perhaps it\u2019s the home of the person who owns the vegetable patch.\n\nLooking at this photograph, one might imagine it was taken deep in India\u2019s hinterlands, where bamboo huts remain a familiar sight and growing vegetables is a way of life. But this hut and the garden were located not in a village but on a major road leading to Delhi.\n\nPhotographer Gauri Gill\u2019s The Village on the Highway is a visual homage to an extraordinary feat of imagination, one that sprung from a year-long stand-off between the Indian state and the people who till the land. Its roots lie in three controversial laws passed in 2020 to reform the agricultural sector, which employs about half of the population, most of them earning woefully little. Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed ownership of the reforms, asserting they granted farmers autonomy. Freed from socialist-era price regulations and local middlemen\u2019s diktats, farmers were now ostensibly free to sell their crops to the highest bidder, whether state-owned companies or global supply chains.\n\nThe intended beneficiaries did not see it that way. Already strained by rising costs, recurrent droughts and mounting debts, many farmers feared they would be thrust into an unequal marketplace, putting their livelihoods at the mercy of powerful corporations.\n\nInitially, groups of farmers staged protests in their regions. Two months later, frustrated by the government\u2019s refusal to listen, some of them marched en masse towards Delhi. That November, hundreds of thousands of farmers, many of them Sikh, set off on foot and in farming vehicles \u2014 tractors, tempos, truck trailers \u2014 from Punjab and Haryana, north India\u2019s agrarian heartlands.\n\nBut the convoy could not enter the capital. At the Singhu border, police and paramilitary personnel stood behind tall metal barricades armed with batons, water cannons and tear gas. The farmers refused to back off. Instead they decided to lay siege to the border, blocking the highway.\n\nSetting up a temporary base required enormous creativity and resourcefulness, efforts that caught Gill\u2019s attention when she visited the Singhu border. \u201cThey began to repurpose the very vehicles that they had arrived on, or the farming equipment that they used daily and knew intimately, into uniquely habitable homes,\u201d she tells me over email. Uncertain how long they would stay, the farmers created spaces where they could sleep, cook and bathe. Where an empty road had stood, there were suddenly bedrooms, storerooms and living rooms. Communal spaces such as libraries, medical camps, small shops and round-the-clock kitchens manifested as if out of thin air.\n\nAs a photographer, Gill was drawn to this \u201chandmade and homegrown architecture of resistance\u201d, as she calls it, which was built on the farmers\u2019 ability to evoke beauty using the barest of objects and materials. \u201cDoors appeared through tarpaulin, walls arose from bamboo and thermocol, and string and tape held together wood,\u201d she recalls.\n\nEach makeshift structure carried a spark of individuality, a touch of quirkiness. Some featured plain jute curtains, others synthetic ones adorned with bold floral patterns. Doors ranged from plain cloth nailed to the backs of trucks to solid bamboo constructions complete with windows, frames and latches.\n\nAs with much of her previous work, Gill\u2019s focus was on highlighting \u201cthe beauty and generosity in places of profound precarity and acute injustice\u201d. The absence of people in these photographs \u2014 a deliberate choice to protect their identities \u2014 does not diminish their centrality. Each domestic object, a pot on a stove or a bucket of bathing water, conveys their presence.\n\nThe farmers stayed for four seasons. In summer, \u00adkhus- (vetiver) infused air coolers were installed. In colder months, thick blankets padded the walls. In the monsoons, mosquito nets shrouded the sleeping areas.\n\nSome of these items arrived with friends and relatives from villages hundreds of miles away, along with fresh food supplies grown in the farms to sustain the langars, or communal kitchens, a cornerstone of the Sikh way of life. The langars fed not only the protesters and their allies but also the police officers posted at the border. Yet, despite their efforts to persevere, hundreds of protesters died, succumbing to harsh weather conditions, age-related complications, dengue fever, accidents and illnesses.\n\nIn November 2021, the government passed a motion to repeal the laws. With their mission accomplished, the farmers dismantled their temporary homes, bid farewell to friends and comrades, and began their journeys home.\n\nThe Indian farmers\u2019 protest of 2020\u201421 is remembered as one of the longest non-violent protests in contemporary history. It is also a rare instance of ordinary citizens triumphing over an unyielding state. Yet it was marked by countless moments when it seemed that the lights were about to go out.\n\n\u201cThe stand-off had gone on so long, it seemed nothing might ever change,\u201d Gill recalls. \u201cFarmers were dying. I felt down, even as a visitor.\u201d Yet their spirits did not waver. \u201cI remember doughty elders saying to me, \u2018One day the tide will turn.\u2019\u201d\n\nGill reflects on the Sikh phrase Chardi Kala, which means choosing optimism even when you can see the difficulties that lie ahead, indeed because of those difficulties. She could feel the farmers drawing strength from it. \u201cI saw that spirit,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe Village on the Highway\u201d is at Vadehra Art Gallery, New Delhi, from February 4 to March 4\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend Magazine on X and FT Weekend on Instagram", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c2dfb9fc-b2cb-4e37-85d4-13bf77658a3f"}}, {"id": "d175cbbe-6a97-456b-a085-2074fe62c4fb", "event_name": "A pivotal budget for India", "blurb": "Also in this newsletter, media companies take OpenAI to court and the tragedy at the Kumbh Mela", "date": "2025-01-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. Journalists all over the world have worn down the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cI\u201d keys on their computers this week and I am no exception. Media companies owned by India\u2019s richest people \u2014 Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani \u2014 have joined a copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI in the Delhi high court. This is the first big case that could determine some critical issues around training rules for generative AI.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s set the scene for tomorrow. Just another Saturday for the world. But Budget Day for India.\n\nI will confess that over the past few years my interest in the Union Budget waned. It was becoming a noisy event with little impact on on-the-ground realities. There would be some bickering about this or that tax for a few days and then we would all go back to our regular lives. But tomorrow when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents her budget proposals in parliament, I\u2019ll be paying close attention. This (financial) year India has been caught in a deadlock of a falling growth rate, high inflation, high interest rates and high unemployment, and Sitharaman\u2019s proposals have the power to determine the course of the economy.\n\nMy guess is that the minister will rely on public spending on infrastructure to boost growth. This will spread public money more widely in the economy and drive up job numbers. Besides, this has been a cornerstone of the Modi government; great roads are also a good talking point during elections. But Sitharaman will have to keep an eye on the fiscal deficit, which the government has targeted at 4.9 per cent of GDP for the year ending March, and so the amount of money she can allocate to infrastructure development will be restricted.\n\nOne perennial budget demand is for a cut in income taxes for the salaried middle-class in India. This year, though, the frustration of this segment \u2014 which pays taxes but does not access some public services like government-run schools or hospitals \u2014 is particularly intense. There is all kinds of speculation about proposed changes, but the most persistent one is that a fourth tax bracket might be introduced. According to local media reports, the government is working on a new income tax act to replace the current law and has been consulting experts for feedback and suggestions. My guess is that it will be unveiled at a later date (perhaps with a complicated Hindi name like the Indian Penal Code, or Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, was in 2024) and the big changes in the tax structure will come then.\n\nThe one thing I feel certain about is that there will be some AI-related announcements. The budget speech has, in recent years, become an exercise in signalling intent by the government. This week there has been a lot of angst about India\u2019s inability to develop an innovative AI product like China\u2019s DeepSeek. The government will use the budget to announce an initiative or two to get on the AI bandwagon. However, these kinds of programmes have had limited success in the past. Schemes like Start up India, Skill India and Digital India, which were announced with much fanfare, have seen their budget outlays shrink every year.\n\nSitharaman\u2019s budget speeches have got shorter over the years. In 2020, she spoke for two hours and 40 minutes, but in 2023 wrapped it up in 87 minutes. (I\u2019m ignoring 2024 because it was an election year and there were two mini-budgets). I only hope she keeps it crisp this year and focuses on the larger, more important points that will help move the needle on the economy and not get bogged down with detailed explanations about minor initiatives. It\u2019s a Saturday, after all.\n\nDo you have any questions about the Budget? Write to us at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply and we\u2019ll answer them next week.\n\nOn the off chance that I haven\u2019t typed AI enough times today, here\u2019s some more. OpenAI is having a terrible week. Globally, it was rattled by the emergence of a scrappier competitor, DeepSeek, and in India, large media companies joined publishers in a lawsuit against the US company. As chronicled by Indian media, the original case was filed by the Indian newswire service, Asian News International (ANI), in November 2024 in the Delhi high court. ANI alleged that OpenAI was training ChatGPT using copyrighted content without authorisation. In early January, the Federation of Indian Publishers joined the case and this week, the Digital News Publishers Association \u2014 whose members include media houses owned by Ambani and Adani \u2014 filed interventions in the case too. OpenAI has questioned the jurisdiction of the court and is contesting the addition of the two new groups since the key issues raised by them are different from those being contested with ANI. (Book publishers, for example, contend that ChatGPT publishes summaries and extracts, but OpenAI\u2019s view is that it picks up the information from publicly available sources and therefore there is no infringement of copyright.)\n\nThe case will be keenly watched as it is grapples with critical questions about copyright in the age of generative artificial intelligence. Most significantly, the court could determine that use of copyrighted data qualifies as \u201cfair use\u201d for AI developers. If OpenAI is able to convince the court of this, it will open up an enormous trove of material to train its software on. (The company is facing similar lawsuits in other countries too.) Detailed hearings are scheduled to begin on February 21. I\u2019ll keep you posted.\n\nTragedy struck at the Kumbh Mela this week when a stampede broke out early on Wednesday morning.\u00a0Here\u2019s what we know, so far.\n\nIt\u2019s a working weekend for me, alas, and I will be spending most of it in front of a screen. If I can manage to find some time, I hope to get started on the gritty sequel of Paatal Lok on Amazon Prime. I know I\u2019m way behind most people on this, but I have been watching Black Warrant on Netflix and it fulfils my weekly quota for gruesome content, thank you very much. As a palate cleanser between episodes, I watched this lovely Thai film, How to Make Millions before Grandma Dies (also on Netflix). I highly recommend it.\n\nIt\u2019s been a very busy work week and my reading, too, is suffering. I have been dipping into Nina Stibbe\u2019s memoir Went to London, Took the Dog for a few minutes before bed every night. It\u2019s hilarious and wholesome.\n\nI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have any strong recommendations for anything else this weekend (or next, actually).

CVC declined to comment.\n\nA stake in Birmingham Phoenix was also on the block, with bidding for stakes in the remaining teams set for the coming days, as the opportunity to buy into English cricket attracts a range of international investors.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board, which is selling the team stakes, has pitched The Hundred auction as a rare chance to buy into a closed league in one of the sport\u2019s biggest markets. It hopes to emulate the success of the Indian Premier League, one of the world\u2019s richest sports properties with multibillion-dollar TV deals. However, The Hundred is still in its infancy and brings in just \u00a340mn a year from broadcast rights.\n\nThe Glazer family, which controls the Manchester United football team, and a consortium that includes Chelsea Football Club co-owner Todd Boehly, are among potential suitors who have shown interest in buying stakes in the franchises. Owners of several teams in the lucrative Indian Premier League are also expected to bid.\n\nVictory for the Ambanis means they have exclusivity and are set to finalise documentation in the coming weeks, according to one of the people. Taking the stake in Oval Invincibles would add to their global cricket interests, which include teams in South Africa, the US and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Ambanis, majority owners of Reliance Industries, are among India\u2019s richest and most influential families, with their business interests extending from energy to telecommunications.\n\nThe family also has interests in entertainment and sport, including ownership of the Mumbai Indians cricket franchise, five-time winners of the lucrative IPL. At last year\u2019s Paris Olympics, Nita Ambani, who is married to tycoon Mukesh Ambani, campaigned for India to host a future Games.\n\nThe sale of the eight teams that compete in The Hundred is a pivotal moment for the future of the game. The ECB initially aimed to raise \u00a3500mn from the auction process but has recently discussed a figure of \u00a3350mn.\n\nThat money has been earmarked to help professional cricket clubs invest in infrastructure upgrades and new revenue sources, such as building hotels or conference facilities at their stadiums. It will also help some clubs reduce their debts.\n\nThe ECB hopes the arrival of professional investors into The Hundred will boost the competition\u2019s appeal both at home and abroad by bringing in fresh expertise in areas such as marketing and fan engagement.\n\nThe new owners will also enable the ECB to increase some of the spending caps in the contest so that it can compete for top cricket talent against the many other short-form competitions that have sprung up across the world.\n\nBringing in deep-pocketed investors will also help The Hundred to attract top cricketers to play in the competition, at a time when star talent can command seven-figure sums to participate in the IPL.\n\nHowever, the competition itself has proved controversial with long-standing cricket fans, with critics complaining that the format is simply a gimmick designed for children and casual viewers.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8f942383-0c6b-48ec-ab00-10eaca956897"}}, {"id": "2076da06-d4d0-44a0-a4c0-299912aecae8", "event_name": "India\u2019s Narendra Modi faces tough budget challenge as economy slows", "blurb": "Finance minister under pressure to revive growth while maintaining fiscal discipline", "date": "2025-01-3000:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s government is under pressure to\u2009turn around a slowing economy but with little room to manoeuvre as it prepares to present one of the most consequential budgets since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power more than a decade ago.\n\nFinance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is facing expectations to announce tax cuts, new capital expenditure and reforms to India\u2019s regulatory regime when she unveils the first full budget of Modi\u2019s third term on Saturday.\n\nBut her ability to revive an economy mired in a broad slowdown \u2014 and allay discontent among the ruling Bharatiya Janata party\u2019s middle- and upper-class political base \u2014 may be limited.\n\nIndia\u2019s pace of growth, while still the fastest among large economies, is heading for a post-pandemic low, dragged down by weaker urban consumption, persistent food inflation, stagnant wage and job growth and sluggish private sector investment.\n\nSecond-quarter fiscal year growth, the most recent reported, was 5.4 per cent, the slowest pace in nearly two years, and the central bank downgraded growth forecasts for the 2024-25 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of pressures \u2014 there has been a cyclical slowdown,\u201d said Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist with GlobalData.TSLombard. \u201cWe have to see whether they will stick with that fiscal discipline they have exhibited over the past few years\u201d, or \u201cdo more on welfare spending\u201d.\n\nNew Delhi recently named Sanjay Malhotra, a former revenue secretary, as Reserve Bank of India governor, a move markets saw as both a changing of the guard and a commitment to the government\u2019s recent record of stronger growth and fiscal rectitude.\n\nIndia\u2019s fiscal deficit is below 5 per cent of GDP and falling, and the government resisted the temptation to unleash populist spending measures in last year\u2019s post-election budget plan, which followed a nationwide poll in which the BJP lost its parliamentary majority.\n\n\u201cThis is a finance ministry that values prudence,\u201d said Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, which expects weaker growth in the first half of this year before a gradual recovery. \u201cA big stimulus package looks unlikely.\u201d\n\nHowever, Shah added that boosting spending on infrastructure \u2014 a hallmark of Modi\u2019s tenure \u2014 \u201cwould help to support economic activity in the near term while also lifting the economy\u2019s medium-term supply potential\u201d.\n\nSpending is already rising in some states, including Maharashtra and Karnataka, where the BJP and opposition rivals are vying to outdo one another with politically driven, open-ended welfare spending promises, pushing the country\u2019s consolidated budget deficit close to 8 per cent of GDP. Local elections are also looming this year in Delhi and Bihar, India\u2019s third-largest state.\n\nWorking in India\u2019s favour, economists expect the country\u2019s inward-focused economy to avoid the brunt of Donald Trump\u2019s expected barrage of tariffs on countries such as China. In a call this week, the US president urged his Indian counterpart to buy more American-made weapons, and Trump later said Modi would probably visit the White House in February.\n\nThe finance minister\u2019s budget address will be followed less than a week later by the RBI\u2019s first monetary policy decision under Malhotra, who replaced the more hawkish Shaktikanta Das.\n\nMalhotra has been facing calls to cut rates from powerful Modi allies, including finance minister Sitharaman and commerce minister Piyush Goyal, who favour lower borrowing costs to support growth, despite inflation that remains close to the top of the central bank\u2019s 4-6 per cent target band.\n\nMany economists expect the RBI to begin easing rates from its current 6.5 per cent level, particularly after it announced measures this week amounting to a near $18bn liquidity infusion in the cash-starved banking sector.\n\nBut Kunal Kundu, India economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, cautioned that the economic vulnerabilities were structural, rather than transitory. He said fundamental shifts, including a focus on education and healthcare investment, were needed for India to create more formal jobs for its huge and under-skilled labour force.\n\n\u201cEmployment and wages remain at the heart of the slowdown,\u201d said Kundu. \u201cWhat\u2019s required is not rocket science: basically, you have to have policies that eventually enable more job generation.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/47fb4c5e-718c-403a-908c-bb490d1516ce"}}, {"id": "d71a8a2f-00ca-4303-be6f-12c86eccbbbd", "event_name": "Police say 30 killed in stampede at Indian religious festival ", "blurb": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi offers condolences to families of \u2018pious souls\u2019 lost in tragedy at Hindu Kumbh Mela gathering ", "date": "2025-01-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Police have said 30 people died in a crush at a Hindu festival in northern India, where millions have gathered for what is considered to be the world\u2019s largest religious event.\n\nVaibhav Krishna, the deputy inspector general of police for the festival, told a press conference that a further 60 people were injured in the stampede at the Kumbh Mela in Uttar Pradesh state in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nKrishna said \u201cthree or four\u201d barriers leading to the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganges rivers had collapsed and that many of the devotees who were killed had been sleeping before they were trampled on.\n\nEmergency services were deployed to the scene and injured pilgrims were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.

Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Brics countries, a grouping of major emerging economies that includes India.\n\nIn a social media post late on Monday, Modi called Trump a \u201cdear friend\u201d and said they were \u201ccommitted to a mutually beneficial and trusted partnership\u201d in several areas, including security.\n\nTrump later told reporters that Modi would visit the White House \u201cprobably in February\u201d, which would make the Indian leader among the first foreign dignitaries to visit since the US president\u2019s inauguration.\n\nTrump\u2019s requests came as India, long the world\u2019s largest arms importer, has been seeking to diversify its weapons suppliers beyond Russia. It has leaned on the US, along with other countries such as France, to close a gap in military technology and preparedness with regional rival China.\n\nModi has also pushed India\u2019s military to support domestic arms manufacturers, part of his ambition for the defence and aviation industries to help make the country a global manufacturing power. Modi has set a target of $35bn for domestic defence production by the end of the decade,\u00a0up from nearly $20bn last year.\n\nNew Delhi needs to upgrade its military capabilities if it is to match those of nuclear-armed neighbour China, according to analysts, including in fighter jets, submarines, tanks, helicopters and even assault rifles. While some domestic arms makers have such capabilities, India lacks critical knowhow for technologies such as military jet engines.\n\nTrump and Modi also discussed expanding security co-operation in the Indo-Pacific region and reiterated their commitment to the Quad \u2014 a strategic grouping that also includes Japan and Australia \u2014 according to the White House.

Investors are increasingly nervous", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "On a sunny early January afternoon, two thousand fishermen, farmers and activists gathered on the dry river bed outside Kotri Barrage in Pakistan, the final dam before the waters of the Indus flow into the Arabian Sea.\n\n\u201cSend this message to Islamabad, send this message to Pindi: we will not drink your gutter water!\u201d shouted one activist, referring to Rawalpindi, where the army is headquartered. \u201cWe reject the canal!\u201d roared the crowd.\n\nThe protests were against a Rs200bn ($720mn) project to build canals that would divert water upstream to eastern Pakistan. There, an agricultural company led by the military, Green Pakistan, hopes to turn a large swath of desert into fertile farmland that will guarantee a steady supply of grain and attract investment from Gulf states.\n\nThe canal project is being directed by the government, but led by the Special Investment Facilitation Council, an investment body co-led by Asim Munir, Pakistan\u2019s army chief of staff. Other SIFC initiatives, led mostly by serving and retired officers, include plans to renovate hotels at the foot of the snowcapped peaks in Pakistan\u2019s north and schemes to exploit mineral and natural gas riches in the mountainous frontier with Afghanistan.\n\nProponents say the army\u2019s role is crucial in projects like this: as well as cutting through red tape and settling the squabbles that have prevented Pakistan from developing export and tourism sectors, it can draw in much-needed foreign investment and reshape one of Asia\u2019s most troubled economies.\n\nThe army has always had an outsized role in Pakistani politics. No fewer than four military dictators have ruled the country since independence in 1947\u00a0\u2014 most recently Pervez Musharraf, who was ejected from power in 2008. Even when civilian governments have been in power, there is widespread evidence that army chiefs have held considerable sway.\n\nAnalysts and officials say that the military\u2019s influence over the country\u2019s civilian government is at its highest level since Musharraf\u2019s resignation.\n\nBut in recent years especially, the tentacles of the military have extended even further, deep into Pakistan\u2019s economy. A 2021 UN report described military-linked businesses as the \u201clargest conglomerate in Pakistan\u201d. And at the launch of Pakistan\u2019s new five-year economic plan on New Year\u2019s eve, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly thanked chief of staff Munir for helping save the country from the brink of default in June 2023.\n\n\u201cI must tell you, without any fear of any kind of exaggeration, that I\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009never experienced this kind of co-operation which I\u2019ve received from the army chief and the institution,\u201d he told the audience.\n\nCritics warn that the military\u2019s ever-expanding economic footprint raises the risk that it will favour its own interests over others.\u00a0There are also concerns that its involvement in politics and the economy is distracting it from counterterrorism work, increasing societal unrest and deterring foreign investment.\n\nThe military\u2019s presence also offers acute challenges for the political factions that govern this country of 240mn people. The Pakistan People\u2019s party is the third-largest party in Islamabad and the ruling party in Sindh \u2014 a province of 50mn people where there is widespread opposition to the canal project.\n\nThe party can either resist \u201cor sell out, letting other, more violent and nationalist forces step in\u201d, says Naveed Qamar, one of its senior members of the national parliament. \u201cWe could see our support completely collapse in Sindh.\u201d\n\nMunir has leaned into the army\u2019s \u201csaviour complex\u201d, says Madiha Afzal, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. The military has come to believe \u201cthat it alone can fix Pakistan, that it alone can guarantee the political stability needed for economic progress and can ensure that the economic ship is righted,\u201d she adds.\n\nPakistan\u2019s military leaders began ramping up their involvement in economic matters around the time of Imran Khan\u2019s ascent to power in 2018. Amid an economic slowdown and the accelerating growth of its great rival, India, the military played a prominent role in Khan\u2019s rise.\n\nBut the former prime minister fell out with the top brass, and generals grew more sceptical that electoral democracy could deliver growth, enable Pakistan to compete with India or serve the army\u2019s own widespread political and business interests, analysts and former officials say.\n\nThe need for a rethink became more acute as Pakistan\u2019s importance to the outside world waned. \u201cTen years ago, the US was in Afghanistan, so Pakistan\u2019s geopolitical position was secure,\u201d says Stefan Dercon, a professor at Oxford who has advised Sharif on economic reform. \u201cThey could expect to be seen as too big to fail.\u201d\n\nCounting on waivers and bailouts from friendly countries worried that its collapse might put nuclear weapons within the reach of Islamist terror groups, Pakistan put off serious structural reforms. \u201cIt was an overdraft without ever needing to be called in,\u201d says Dercon. \u201cThat\u2019s changed now.\u201d\n\nWhen Munir became chief of the army staff in November 2022, seven months after Khan was ousted and replaced by Sharif, the country was still haemorrhaging dollar reserves, inflation was rocketing and insurgencies were starting to flare up along the Afghanistan border.\n\nSince then, the general has made saving the economy a core part of his public image.\u00a0Last November, he told a group of businessmen in Karachi that \u201call indicators of Pakistan\u2019s economy are positive\u201d, according to a report by the state news agency. \u201cWhere are the people now who spread disappointment and talked about default?\u201d he added.\n\nMunir has secured an extension to his term, potentially allowing him to stay in office for 10 years rather than the usual maximum of six.\n\nPakistan\u2019s elected government now comprises an alliance of parties whose leaders have all fallen foul of the army in the past, but have united to prevent Khan \u2014 whose allies won the most votes in last February\u2019s contested election \u2014 from returning to power.\n\nWith Khan in prison, the government wants to use its time in power to pursue ambitious reforms that ministers say will transform Pakistan\u2019s boom-and-bust economy.\n\nTheir close ties to the army, they say, insulate them from the feuds and public backlashes that have prevented past prime ministers from completing full terms.\n\n\u201cThere is a broad understanding between all pillars of state that any political uncertainty and political instability would be suicidal for Pakistan,\u201d says planning minister Ahsan Iqbal. \u201cThere is very good positive synergy\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009between the establishment [a common euphemism for the military] and the government to take this economic recovery path together,\u201d he tells the Financial Times.\n\nIn addition to Munir sitting atop the SIFC, alongside the prime minister, serving generals also run Pakistan\u2019s national population registry, its anti-corruption watchdog and task forces pursuing tax reform and the renegotiation of energy contracts.\n\nMunir also directed a 2023 operation against currency smuggling, while admirers also cite his ties to the Gulf monarchies that Pakistan depends upon for financing.\n\nOne senior government official acknowledges that \u201cthere has definitely been mission creep\u201d, but blames politicians: \u201cWe failed to take the steps we should have taken before to fix the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The army] acts as a nudge to get us to tax our voter bank, or right-size the government,\u201d the official adds. \u201cThey see themselves as guardrails for the economic reform journey.\u201d\n\nIn the 18 months since Pakistan\u2019s near-default, the country has returned to a semblance of economic stability. In September, it secured a $7bn IMF bailout and inflation fell to 4.1 per cent in December \u2014 having peaked at 38 per cent in June 2023. The central bank has cut interest rates and has enough dollar reserves to cover over two months of imports.\n\nTo shore up its finances and retain IMF support, Pakistan\u2019s government raised taxes on salaried workers, removed popular energy subsidies and promised to introduce taxes on the politically sensitive agriculture and real estate sectors. It has also said it would slash trade tariffs by a third over three years.\n\nBut the country\u2019s economy is still growing more slowly than its population, with a million more people entering the workforce each year than there are formal jobs. \u201cGrowth is still very low,\u201d says Hasnain Malik, head of equity and investment strategy at emerging and frontier market research company Tellimer.\n\n\u201cThe huge devaluation of the currency has left its scars on consumption power without yet triggering an export boom, and external debt refinancing needs are still very high.\u201d\n\nIn mid-January, a group of Pakistani wind energy executives sat down in a conference room in a military base in Rawalpindi.\n\nAccording to two of those present, a team of bureaucrats flanked by half a dozen uniformed army officers demanded that they revise the state-backed contracts they had signed years before \u2014 changes the government says would bring down electricity prices for ordinary people.\n\nOne of the executives says they were informed by a bureaucrat that \u201cif you do not want to work with us, we will let the right people get in touch\u201d \u2014 meaning one of the officers behind him.\n\n\u201cThe message was clear,\u201d says the executive, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cWe will probably need to shut down our wind farm in Sindh to avoid going into default now.\u201d\n\nThe episode was the one of several negotiations with power producers that Pakistani authorities, with the support of the security services, have undertaken since August.\n\nNadeem Anjum, the then head of Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan\u2019s foreign spy agency, also met energy executives towards the end of 2024 to discuss renegotiating power contracts.\n\nA decade ago, Pakistan attracted heavy foreign investment in its power sector by promising dollar-indexed, state-guaranteed returns. But the recent surge in electricity prices has turned such investors into public villains.\n\nSharif has celebrated these renegotiations as proof that his government will take bold steps to bring down power bills. But they have unnerved the business community and foreign investors, according to seven energy sector executives who shared details with the Financial Times.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t lawyer up and go to arbitration \u2014 we have to live and do business in this country,\u201d complains another energy executive who had his contract terminated last year.\n\nA Ministry of Power spokesperson says the ongoing renegotiations \u201cwill be according to law and with mutual agreement as in the past\u201d.\n\nA letter sent by the German embassy to Munir in October, and seen by the FT, questioned the \u201cunusual manner\u201d in which negotiations over Rousch Power, a company in which a unit of German engineering giant Siemens held a significant stake, were being conducted. It went on to warn that the affair was \u201calready damaging the trust of German enterprises and investors\u201d.\n\nSiemens confirmed that Pakistan\u2019s government had asked to renegotiate the power contracts but did not comment on the contents of the letter. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry offered no comment either.\n\nCritics say that these disputes are hindering Islamabad\u2019s efforts to pursue other reforms, such as the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines. One businessman, who also asked for anonymity, says that having his company\u2019s power contract terminated had forced him to pull out of talks about the airline.\n\nTwo other investors say their participation in a second round of bidding for PIA will depend on the government protecting their stakes in the airline. They also say that they plan to reach out to Fauji Foundation, a conglomerate linked to the military, to join their consortium \u201cas an insurance policy\u201d.\n\nWhile a loss of external investment could yet create an incentive for reform, Ahmed Pirzada, a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol, says there is also \u201ca risk that the country\u2019s elites will respond by consolidating their control over resources, effectively grabbing a larger share of a shrinking economic pie to maintain their lifestyles\u201d.\n\nAzeema Cheema, a director at Verso Consulting, adds that the government\u2019s unpopularity incentivises it \u201cto stick to the few friends it has left, instead of governing for the public at large\u201d.\n\nLast year\u2019s budget was peppered with pork-barrel spending and tax breaks, with legislators, bureaucrats and serving and retired military officers among the main beneficiaries.\u00a0\u201cThe whole idea becomes spend, spend, spend on initiatives that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. serve only to appease their household guards,\u201d adds Cheema.\n\nPakistan\u2019s military has also launched a broad-based crackdown against political opponents. Thousands of members of Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party have been taken to anti-terrorism and military courts, while many senior leaders have gone into hiding.\n\nThe detentions have drawn criticism from abroad, with the EU warning in late December that military trials for civilians were inconsistent with commitments Pakistan had made to gain access to a preferential trade agreement that has been a lifeline to its textile sector.\n\nSince last year, protests like those in Sindh have erupted throughout the country. Demonstrators calling for Khan\u2019s release clashed with police in Islamabad and others in Balochistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir staged sit-ins and strikes over crackdowns on civil rights.\n\nGovernment and military officials say a muscular approach is needed to defeat terrorism and ensure the political stability necessary for investors to feel safe. But they have denied that their actions violate Pakistan\u2019s constitution, and insist the military does not participate in politics.\n\nThe Pakistan Armed Forces and SIFC did not reply to repeated requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, critics warn that public disaffection with the government is only increasing. They point to increasingly brutal insurgencies that last year led to more than 2,000 deaths in the western provinces where Pakistan is keen on tapping into mineral and gas reserves.\n\nIn Balochistan, \u201cit is hard to find a single family that does not have someone missing or killed\u201d, says Mahvish Ahmad, a professor in human rights and politics at the London School of Economics. The province is home to a Chinese-backed port, Gwadar, and Pakistan hopes to develop a giant copper mine there.\n\nSharif\u2019s coalition has also sought to tighten its grip over the internet and social media, claiming that misinformation is undermining public faith in the government and the armed forces.\n\nKalsoom Lakhani, the co-founder of i2i Ventures, a Pakistan-focused venture capital firm, says throttling the internet \u201cacts as a ceiling on the Pakistani start-up space and commerce as a whole\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrariness of all of it also adds to overall uncertainty,\u201d she adds, scaring investors away from an industry that contributed over $3bn in export earnings last year.\n\nAfzal, of the Brookings Institution, says the military \u201csees political repression as generating political stability, which is needed for economic stability\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut that political stability comes via cementing its own hold on power, with a politically subservient civilian government nominally in charge,\u201d she adds. \u201cPakistan\u2019s democracy looks worse now than at any point since 2008.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Chris Kay in Mumbai and Patricia Nilsson in Frankfurt\n\nData visualisation by Janina Conboye", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f3dae073-c158-43e2-a8c6-628acc46a868"}}, {"id": "874727ae-789a-486a-a07c-347d870bc38d", "event_name": "India's banking sector slump", "blurb": "Also in this newsletter: China is building the world\u2019s largest dam and Ashish Gupta\u2019s mantra", "date": "2025-01-2800:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning.

Saturday\u2019s budget announcements will determine where the markets go next.\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter, we take a look at the performance of the banking sector and what that says about the economy. Plus, India is alarmed by China\u2019s plans to build the world\u2019s largest dam in Tibet.\n\nIndia\u2019s banking sector is having a difficult year, with rising bad debts and a weak outlook for credit growth. The quarterly earnings of major private banks, which were announced this month, show a larger number of customers defaulting on the interest payment of their loans. These defaults are highest in the unsecured loans category \u2014 credit cards and personal loans.\n\nAmitabh Chaudhry, chief executive of Axis Bank, said it was a \u201ctough environment\u201d and expected both deposit and credit growth to be subdued until 2026. HDFC Bank, the country\u2019s largest private lender by market capitalisation, reported a 17 per cent rise in provisions (money set aside to cover potential bad loans), a sign it is preparing for higher defaults in the future. ICICI Bank, which announced its results on Friday, offered better news overall but it, too, saw its provisions rise.\n\nTogether with the results of consumer goods companies, which are witnessing slowing demand especially in urban areas, these numbers illustrate the real troubles in the economy. Rising inflation has forced the Reserve Bank of India to keep interest rates high, leading to significant slowdowns in consumption and credit growth. The government this month revised down its GDP growth forecast for the year starting in April to 6.4 per cent.\n\nIn a surprise move yesterday, the central bank announced three measures to inject liquidity into the banking system. These included open market purchase auctions of government securities, a variable rate repo auction (where the central bank allows banks to borrow at a variable interest rate, which is determined through an auction), and a foreign exchange swap where the RBI buys US dollars from banks and strikes a deal to sell them at a later date.\n\nThis sets the scene for Saturday, when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to announce her budget proposals in parliament.

The 60-gigawatt project is three times the size of China\u2019s Three Gorges, which is currently the world\u2019s largest hydropower facility, and could cost $137bn. The proposed dam is on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra, and lies close to Arunachal Pradesh. India\u2019s worries are related to security as well the ecological repercussions of this construction. The dam will give China the power to control water supply to Arunachal Pradesh, including the ability to flood parts of the state. It will also probably change the flow of the river and have an impact on the availability of water downstream even during peacetime.\n\nIndia\u2019s concerns also underline the uneasy relationship between the two large neighbours. After four years of tensions along the Line of Actual Control, in October 2024 the two countries reached a deal to de-escalate the military stand-off. Subsequently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Russia for their first bilateral meeting in five years. Both countries have since withdrawn tens of thousands of troops from the region.\n\nBut the dam sets up the prospect of intensifying competition over water resources between the two nations. India has announced plans to build what would be the subcontinent\u2019s largest dam, the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project, in Arunachal Pradesh. (Caught between the two is the smaller Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which too has built several medium-sized dams on the same river.) That there will be a significant ecological impact from this is a given, even if China is promoting it as an environmentally-friendly sustainable source of electricity. India is right to be concerned about the strategic edge the dam gives China, but it has limited options to counter the threat.\n\nGlobal investors made the best use of booming secondary markets and offloaded a record amount of private equity stakes in 2024\n\nEach week, we invite a top Indian business leader to tell us their mantra for work and life.

Last October, New Delhi and Beijing reached a deal to resolve a military stand-off and agreed to military patrols along their disputed Himalayan border.\n\nIndia fears that the dam, located in seismic Tibet, could spur floods and water scarcity downstream, while giving China the upper hand in any potential stand-off between the nuclear-armed neighbours, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThere are fears of all kinds,\u201d said Shivshankar Menon, India\u2019s former national security adviser and chair of the Ashoka Centre for China Studies. \u201cThe geopolitics don\u2019t help, obviously, because nobody trusts anybody in this.\u201d\n\nTibet has a third of China\u2019s hydroelectric power potential. The Yarlung Tsangpo \u2014 the world\u2019s highest major waterway \u2014 is Tibet\u2019s longest river, and is called Brahmaputra in India before it turns into the Jamuna in Bangladesh.\n\nThe 60-gigawatt dam on the Tibetan plateau\u2019s rim lies near the border with the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, the eastern tip of India over which Beijing claims sovereignty and the two sides fought a war in 1962.\n\n\u201cIndia and Bangladesh are concerned that the dam would change the river\u2019s natural flow, which could disrupt access to water for agriculture, drinking and other essential human needs,\u201d said Neeraj Singh Manhas, an expert on transboundary rivers and water security in south Asia.\n\nBarry Sautman, a political scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said China could argue, however, that Tibet was not the main source of water for the Brahmaputra. \u201cSomewhere between 7 per cent and 30 per cent of the water comes from Tibet. The rest comes from rainfall [downstream],\u201d said Sautman.\n\nWhen it formally announced the dam on Christmas Day, Beijing said it would \u201cbring more sense of gain, happiness and security to the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet\u201d.\n\nChinese officials have dismissed concerns about the impact on environmental or downriver water supplies.\u00a0\u201cThe project will not have a negative impact on the ecological environment, geological conditions and the rights and interests related to water resources of downstream countries,\u201d said China\u2019s foreign ministry\u2019s spokesperson Guo Jiakun.\n\nActivists allege that the 193 hydropower projects built in Tibet since 2000 have led to serious environmental and human rights violations. China\u2019s extensive dam-building projects in Tibet have previously attracted fierce opposition, such as around the Kamtok, or Gangtuo, hydroelectric power plant on the eastern Jinsha river.\n\n\u201cWe are anticipating there would be a huge negative impact,\u201d said Malik Fida Khan, executive director of Bangladesh\u2019s Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services, a government research centre.\n\nIndia is also planning to build what would be the subcontinent\u2019s largest dam, the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project, with an output capacity of 11GW in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nPema Khandu, chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, told Indian news agency PTI that this dam was aimed at \u201cmitigating potential flood risks from water releases\u201d because China was \u201cunpredictable and can do anything\u201d.\n\nIndia\u2019s dam project has also ignited opposition from local populations and concerns in Bangladesh.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nian Liu in Beijing, cartography by Steven Bernard and data visualisation by Bob Haslett", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3d1a4333-57e9-4e04-b144-882ca3e7fab7"}}, {"id": "2c1de6f9-ff09-4836-b477-60ee0def1af4", "event_name": "Lessons from ancient India on post-conflict reconstruction ", "blurb": "Peace engineering is difficult to measure but critical to do", "date": "2025-01-2600:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is a biomedical systems engineer and author of \u2018Wicked Problems: How to Engineer a Better World\u2019\n\nAncient India\u2019s greatest engineering achievement wasn\u2019t a monument but a metamorphosis. When Emperor Ashoka, who ruled most of the Indian subcontinent in the third century BCE, saw the carnage he wrought in the Kalinga war \u2014 over 100,000 dead \u2014 he redirected his empire\u2019s technical prowess from combat to community. Modern conflict zones everywhere, from Sudan to Myanmar, Gaza to Ukraine, await a similar transformation.\n\nAshoka\u2019s infrastructure once forged dominance over an area that spanned Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Siege engines demolished defences, roads propelled armies, fortifications constrained movement and ports dictated trade. After his moral awakening, however, military roads became pilgrimage paths dotted with wells and rest houses; barriers transformed into trading posts. His edicts, carved into mountainsides, proclaimed a radical vision: infrastructure should be a tool for social cohesion rather than control.\n\nThis vision resonates in modern history. The postwar reconstruction Marshall Plan rewove western Europe\u2019s fractured landscape through roads, power grids and industries, fostering social recovery. Japan\u2019s bullet train Shinkansen was more than a railway \u2014 it marked a shift from wartime priorities to economic integration and national connectivity. Post-cold war Germany turned former checkpoints like Berlin\u2019s Potsdamer Platz into social hubs of reunification. Northern Ireland\u2019s Peace Bridge spanned decades of sectarian divide, symbolising reconciliation. In Rwanda and Sri Lanka, community centres and reopened highways like the A-9 mended societies torn apart by genocide and civil war. These examples affirm Ashoka\u2019s insight: infrastructure can unite or divide, depending on its design.\n\nBut centring peace in engineering also confronts stark realities. Billions of dollars flow into military machinery while peace-building efforts scrape by. Businesses prioritise proxies of power \u2014 price and speed \u2014 over reducing conflict risks. Harmony and stability can feel like unaffordable luxuries.\n\nReconstruction is sometimes less about materials available than about power \u2014 who controls, who benefits, and whose version of history prevails. Technical neutrality is a profitable \u2014 and pernicious \u2014 myth. These constraints expose a deeper predicament. Defence contracts offer clean metrics and measurable outcomes but peace resists such quantification. Like public health or preventive maintenance, its benefits can be hard to evaluate. Without ways to review and reward it, even visionary engineers may find it difficult to justify spending money.\n\nThere is also the need to find agreed upon standards \u2014 each tied to clear metrics and mandates. Safety engineering progressed through structural load limits and fire codes, giving tangible form to abstract risks. Environmental engineering advanced through emissions standards and related safeguards, making invisible threats visible. Peace engineering requires similar discipline \u2014 methods to gauge the results of infrastructure choices.\n\nIn Iraq\u2019s 2003 reconstruction, standard technical metrics showed restored infrastructure exceeding prewar electrical capacity. But this masked a more complicated reality. Years of conflict and sanctions had cultivated decentralised networks. Unreliable central grids had taught Baghdad\u2019s residents to rely on local generators \u2014 adaptive solutions that persisted even after centralised systems returned. This divergence between technical success and lived experience underscores a critical insight: successful infrastructure requires an understanding of those who will use it. Designing infrastructure like transportation networks isn\u2019t simply solving technical puzzles \u2014 it determines how communities interact long into the future. This requires evaluation conducted with the same rigour as structural integrity or environmental protection.\n\nIn peacetime, engineering firms already balance complex risks and competing priorities. Analysing infrastructure\u2019s social effects as well isn\u2019t mission creep \u2014 it\u2019s essential wisdom. This is an important lesson to remember as Ukraine works to rebuild its power grids and Gaza reconstructs its water systems.\n\nEngineering shaped Ashoka\u2019s empire twice: first as an instrument of conquest, then as a foundation for peace. Two millennia later, his transformation highlights an elemental truth: peace isn\u2019t an ideal to contemplate but a structure to make and maintain.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/62fc4b16-85b3-4d3c-b898-7604833aba24"}}, {"id": "1c4519b8-dbcf-470a-80e7-1b8e98805263", "event_name": "Indian jewellers build on diaspora to break into western markets", "blurb": "Cities such as London and New York have become springboards to reach buyers looking for cultural authenticity", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "When Viren Bhagat announced plans to set up shop in London, he joined a growing number of Indian jewellers expanding into western markets, where the vast majority of the country\u2019s diaspora live.\n\nBhagat started to increase his exposure outside India through his participation in Tefaf, the European Fine Art Foundation fair held annually in Maastricht and New York. Most recently, his work gained attention when Nita Ambani (pictured above), the wife of Asia\u2019s richest tycoon Mukesh Ambani, wore a striking set of his jewellery \u2014 comprising a headpiece, necklace, armlet, two cuffs and a ring, all adorned with larger-than-life emeralds \u2014 at the highly publicised and lavish wedding of her son, Anant Ambani.\n\nIndia has a long-standing tradition of crafting jewellery and cutting and polishing gemstones \u2014 90 per cent of the world\u2019s rough diamonds are processed in the country.\n\nIdiosyncratic cultural practices also set the country apart. For instance, engagement and wedding ceremonies involve exchanging gold jewellery, including a \u201cmangalsutra\u201d necklace for the bride and a bracelet for the groom; although the giving of an engagement ring ahead of a ceremony is rare. On festive occasions, jewellery sets are worn, and deemed incomplete without headpieces, armlets and anklets.\n\nWhile such traditions have historically hindered the expansion of western jewellers in India, they have contributed to the growth of local talents and supported their expansion abroad \u2014 as Indians living outside the country seek to uphold their customs.\n\n\u201cAt first, the Indian diaspora made up a significant portion of our clientele, as they already knew the brand and trusted its quality,\u201d recalls Sabyasachi Mukherjee, founder of Sabyasachi, one of the first Indian luxury brands to establish a retail presence at department stores Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, in 2020.\n\nIn 2023, the brand then brought its jewellery to a British audience by showcasing pieces at London\u2019s Lancaster House and participating in the charitable Animal Ball, organised by wildlife charity Elephant Family and indigenous peoples initiative the Tintra Foundation. The event was attended by King Charles and Queen Camilla, who both wore traditional Shola masks designed by Sabyasachi.\n\n\u201cBranching out into the west was a natural progression in our quest to become India\u2019s first global luxury brand,\u201d says Mukherjee. \u201cThe understanding and consumption of jewellery is universal \u2014 it is the most accessible category to introduce India\u2019s traditions of craft, quality and authenticity. The west has always admired the richness of our culture, and I saw a unique opportunity to introduce an Indian voice to the global luxury market.\u201d\n\nThe growing global interest in Bollywood cinema and its stars, such as Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra \u2014 brand ambassadors for Cartier and Bvlgari, respectively \u2014 has drawn the attention of western audiences. Also, global luxury brands, such as Cartier, organise ad hoc events to celebrate the Indian Diwali festival, underscoring the growing influence of Indian creativity abroad.\n\n\u201cOver time, our customer base has diversified,\u201d says Mukherjee. \u201cToday, our western clients include individuals who value cultural authenticity, unique designs, and impeccable craftsmanship. Our jewellery resonates with collectors, art enthusiasts, and fashion lovers who appreciate the story behind each piece. Hollywood celebrities and international stylists have also embraced our work, helping us reach audiences far beyond the diaspora.\u201d\n\nWhile Sabyasachi\u2019s designs remain distinctively Indian, a new wave of Indian creators have purposefully expanded abroad to break free from traditional aesthetics. They are targeting a public receptive to new motifs that, while informed by Indian heritage, are not immediately attributable to that particular culture.\n\nThis has been the case for Ananya Malhotra, founder of Ananya, who, by opening a showroom in London in 2022, has found a suitable audience and accelerated her brand\u2019s growth. Ananya\u2019s use of colourful gemstones and designs that reinterpret Indian traditions, such as the chakra bracelet, with a refreshing contemporary twist has gained favour with an international clientele, even beyond the UK. \u201cLondon is a melting pot for so many cultures; it really offers a unique, wholesome exposure for a brand,\u201d she says.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Karina Choudhrie, who opened her first office in the UK in 2010 and an atelier seven years ago. Choudhrie has seen her business grow rapidly, attracting clients beyond the millions of Indians forming the diaspora and local British buyers. \u201cWe have had clients from Brazil, [North] America, Europe, and Asia,\u201d she says. \u201cLondon has been the perfect base for us and we have seen the business progress organically, largely by word of mouth.\u201d\n\nOutposts in Dubai and New Delhi have allowed her to navigate the challenges posed by Brexit and the removal of VAT refunds for tourists. \u201cWe manufacture in Valenza, Italy, and Jaipur, India, and have offices in Dubai, London, and New Delhi,\u201d Choudhrie explains. \u201cBefore Brexit, we could get deliveries much faster. However, since Brexit, the process has become significantly slower.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the inability of tourists to claim back the 20 per cent VAT has had a noticeable effect on our business in London. That said, having offices in both Dubai and London has helped us adapt to these challenges.\u201d\n\nValery Demure \u2014 founder of an agency representing jewellers and a regular exhibitor at PAD, the London design and art fair \u2014 says that, despite issues linked to Brexit and VAT, London remains a vital window for international jewellers. Prestigious art fairs, such as Frieze, that attract wealthy clients, and a lively sporting and social calendar \u2014 including events such as Royal Ascot and Wimbledon, attended by royal family members \u2014 all contribute to London\u2019s enduring appeal.\n\nAt last year\u2019s PAD, Demure showcased Studio Renn, by Mumbai-based couple Rahul and Roshni Jhaveri, which created a series of rings made from unconventional materials, including concrete. It made a strong statement that, whether by honouring traditions, updating them or breaking them entirely, Indian jewellers remain committed to changing perceptions, and expanding beyond their national borders.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c2244bb2-94e9-4c8c-b259-732daeb9ceb8"}}, {"id": "13e0fa0b-9a23-412f-bcbf-b054156c8227", "event_name": "India\u2019s restaurants versus Swiggy and Zomato", "blurb": "Also in this newsletter, Hindustan Unilever readies for Gen Z customers and the 76th Republic Day parade", "date": "2025-01-2400:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning.

Do you have any questions? Send them to us and we\u2019ll answer them the week after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announces her plans for the year.\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter, we look at Hindustan Unilever\u2019s acquisition of homegrown skincare brand Minimalist, a mouthwatering prospect for other direct-to-customer brands. But first, the big fight. It\u2019s restaurants versus Swiggy and Zomato.\n\nThe delivery person is taking over the kitchen. The already uneasy relationship between restaurants and food delivery apps has now taken a turn for the worse, with the launch of Swiggy\u2019s Snacc and Zomato-owned Blinkit\u2019s Bistro. These standalone apps from the two popular delivery platforms promise to deliver meals, snacks and beverages in under 15 minutes. How is it different from regular Swiggy and Zomato, you ask? The platforms have effectively taken restaurants out of the equation; the food is sourced from so-called \u201cdark\u201d kitchens.\n\nThe association of restaurant owners is up in arms. They are evaluating legal options, as well as adding this to a complaint they have already registered with the competition commission. Their contention is that Swiggy and Zomato have access to all the data and this can be used to predict customer preferences and run a more efficient operation, putting traditional eateries at a disadvantage. The new apps will also be able to dynamically price their samosas and biryani.\n\nTheir angst is understandable. Restaurants are in a tough position \u2014 they can neither live with Swiggy and Zomato nor can they live without them. The food delivery companies\u2019 massive fleets give restaurants access to a much larger base of customers but cut into their margins, charging platform fees and placing tremendous pressure on restaurants to extend offers and discounts. Even if a restaurant invests in its own delivery service, customers are now so comfortable with these platforms that it is difficult to get them to change their behaviour and order directly. What was seen as a blessing for the industry during the pandemic has now become an existential threat.\n\nParadoxically, food delivery platforms, too, are finding it tough going. Zomato, which announced its quarterly results earlier this week, reported a slowdown in the gross order value of its food delivery business. This is the total value of all orders before cancellations, refunds etc. Its stock has fallen nearly 20 per cent since, and shares in rival Swiggy have dropped 9 per cent this week too.\n\nIn a letter to restaurant partners last week, Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal wrote that his goal for Bistro was to find a workable model that the restaurant industry can replicate. I am not sure what comfort restaurants can take in this. There is no denying that Swiggy and Zomato have had significant impact in changing urban lives (not to mention the ubiquitous presence of orange and red riders on our streets), but much of this was fuelled by venture capitalist money racing for customer acquisition. Now that the discounts are drying up, customers are going back to the simpler (and healthier) pleasures of home-cooked meals.\n\nHave you cut down on Swiggy/Zomato orders? (I have). Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nHindustan Unilever\u2019s Rs30bn ($345mn) acquisition of skincare brand Minimalist is a shot in the arm for homegrown brands started mostly by young entrepreneurs who use the power of social media to sell directly to customers. Minimalist was founded five years ago by two brothers, Rahul and Mohit Yadav. The Jaipur-based duo launched a series of serums to help alleviate skincare concerns, but they ran a tight ship and managed to get a valuation of Rs1bn in less than a year. The brothers, who get to take home more than Rs18bn from this deal, will continue to work in the business for the next two years.\n\nInstagram has been a breeding ground of sorts for several homegrown brands in the skincare and beauty segment. Sugar Cosmetics, Lovechild, and Dot & Key are some of the more popular names. The Meta ecosystem helps these brands circumvent the big traditional operating costs involved in running consumer businesses. Their advertisements are Instagram reels, often featuring the founders themselves or their friends and family. Orders are placed through the same platform and customer communication is on WhatsApp. The logistics model for product delivery is also easy to access, cheap and well-established by now.\n\nCompetition is high but brands that manage to keep costs low and run a tight operation have seen valuations gallop. To me, the most significant aspect of this acquisition is that it signals the coming of age of Gen Z, which has now started entering the workforce. It is imperative for Hindustan Unilever, the grand doyen of the consumer business, to understand the ways of this new creature, their customers of the future.\n\nSunday is India\u2019s 76th Republic Day, and this year is special because it marks 75 years of the Indian Constitution. Here is a look at what you can expect in the parade this year.\n\nMy favourite activity when I left home for college was going to the post office and sending my parents telegram messages by picking a random greeting code (Kids, I don\u2019t have the time to explain this to you now).

The fourth-largest private sector bank by market value announced a $729mn net profit for its December quarter, missing analyst expectations and sending its shares 8 per cent lower since.\n\nIts retail lending book grew by 11 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with 27 per cent growth for the same period in 2023. The bank said it had also more than doubled its cover for potential bad loans to $249mn.\n\nChief executive Amitabh Chaudhry described it as \u201ca tough environment\u201d and said rising delinquencies, especially in unsecured products, had been fuelled by \u201ccredit hungriness and over-leverage\u201d. \u201cSlippages are mainly in our retail unsecured book, largely in cards and personal loans,\u201d he added. \u201cGiven the heightened delinquency levels in the industry, we continue to remain cautious in our outlook towards unsecured.\u201d\n\nAnalysts had projected similar results for other banks. Across the industry, \u201cthere is genuine concern [that] credit growth will drop to single digits\u201d, said Rahul Arora, chief executive of Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities in Mumbai.\n\nThe RBI, which launched its crackdown on unsecured lending after millions of Indian households loaded up on easily available credit, said in its financial stability report at the end of December that its measures to curb risky lending were \u201cfructifying\u201d. The sector\u2019s annual retail lending growth was down from a compound annual growth rate of 26.9 per cent between September 2021 and September 2023 to 13 per cent in September 2024.\n\n\u201cAn area of concern, however, is the sharp rise in write-offs, especially among private sector banks, which could be partly masking worsening asset quality in this segment and dilution in underwriting standards,\u201d the central bank noted. In late 2023, the RBI raised the minimum amount of capital that must be held for personal loans from 100 per cent to 125 per cent, to decrease risks.\n\nConcerns about slowing credit \u2014 a drag on the economy with the government downgrading expected growth to 6.4 per cent this fiscal year compared to previous estimates of 8.2 per cent \u2014 have also made investors wary about the industry.\n\nSome large Indian lenders\u2019 earnings have been more robust. Kotak Mahindra Bank\u2019s shares jumped more than 9 per cent on Monday after it posted a 10 per cent rise in quarterly profit, even as money set aside for potential bad loans increased 37 per cent.\n\nBut across the sector, S&P Global Market Intelligence said the market capitalisation of India\u2019s top banks fell in the fourth quarter as \u201cinvestor sentiment turned sour amid lacklustre credit growth and shrinking margins\u201d. Of the 20 largest banks, 15 lost value compared to the previous quarter.\n\nThe Nifty Banking Index, which tracks the stock performance of India\u2019s largest lenders, has dropped 5.3 per cent over the past month \u2014 deeper than a 2.3 per cent fall in the country\u2019s blue-chip benchmark Nifty 50 over the same period.\n\nLoan growth had been mainly driven by the non-corporate segment, and business lending had yet to resume, according to Ashish Gupta, chief investment officer at Axis Mutual Fund.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly pockets that were overheated and needed to be clamped down on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the other thing is that we should allow some degree of accidents to happen, there has to be some degree of risk-taking in lending.\u201d\n\nThe pressures on the industry\u2019s loan book come as India\u2019s banking sector also struggles with tight liquidity, with the RBI ramping up dollar sales to defend the country\u2019s currency. Along with tax outflows, this \u201cmagnified the squeeze in recent weeks\u201d, said DBS Bank economist Radhika Rao.\n\nOn January 15, the central bank announced it would start conducting daily variable rate repo auctions after the banking system liquidity deficit rose past Rs2tn ($23bn) last week. Those actions were \u201clikely to at least neutralise the draining impact of regular intervention, in the face of global pressure points\u201d, Rao said.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9a825e8d-b84d-4efd-8af4-16a927f55792"}}, {"id": "1037a778-b228-42f0-99ff-18d8f20db279", "event_name": "The fight over land holding back India\u2019s green energy revolution", "blurb": "Competing demand for space is leading to bitter disputes between companies and the people who rely on farming to make a living", "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0", "body": "For decades, farmers had tilled the land outside the town of Nandgaon in western India, growing crops including corn and millet.\n\nBut in late 2022, Tata Power, one of the country\u2019s largest energy producers, announced it would begin setting up hundreds of glinting photovoltaic panels stretching out across that sun-drenched patch of countryside in the state of Maharashtra.\n\nThe 100-megawatt solar development by the arm of the vast Indian conglomerate, which aims to supply clean electricity to domestic steel producer Viraj Profiles, alarmed the local community. Many see the solar plant as a corporate land grab of a slice of state-owned territory that their families had been granted permission to cultivate over multiple generations.\n\n\u201cWe want the land to be ours again,\u201d declares Malik Jhela Hire, a weather-beaten 75-year-old farmer. \u201cWe want justice.\u201d\n\nAs construction began on the solar park, a group of farmers mounted protests and hunger strikes outside the offices of top local government officials, claiming their rights were being ignored.\n\nTaking note, Maharashtra\u2019s forest department, which claims purview over the land, ordered action against the Tata project. Codenamed \u201cOperation Solar\u201d, a morning raid in late March 2023 saw about 100 law enforcement officers descend on the site and seal it up.\n\nThe situation typifies the complexities India is facing as it embarks on its green energy revolution. In India, the third-biggest carbon polluter globally, billions of dollars are being poured into projects to meet a government target to more than double its non-fossil fuel sources of power to 500 gigawatts by the end of the decade.\n\nBut this breakneck effort is triggering land disputes across the world\u2019s most populous nation, highlighting the difficulty of building out capacity in fast-growing, crowded and power-hungry developing countries.\n\nThe raid on Tata\u2019s solar project is just one example of the stumbling blocks in India\u2019s energy transition. Companies are frequently struggling to find available land and are becoming ensnared in ownership conflicts.\n\n\u201cIt already is a challenge and I suspect that as more and more projects are being developed it will become an even greater challenge,\u201d says Jason Pellmar, regional industry manager for infrastructure in India, Bhutan and Maldives at the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corporation.\n\nOther obstacles include environmental hold-ups, such as the legal protection granted to the Great Indian Bustard, a gravely endangered and poor-sighted bird that flies into renewable transmission lines in India\u2019s northern deserts.\n\nIndia\u2019s clean energy sector has also come under renewed focus after US prosecutors indicted infrastructure magnate Gautam Adani \u2014 who has raised billions of dollars from American investors \u2014 as well as some executives at the billionaire\u2019s eponymous conglomerate. The charges relate to an alleged $265mn bribery scheme of Indian officials to secure solar deals.\n\nAdani, who denies any wrongdoing, has had projects come up against marginalised communities as have many major power producers. According to Indian research group Land Conflict Watch, at least 31 disputes involving green energy projects have affected nearly 44,000 people \u2014 a figure that founder and director Kumar Sambhav calls a \u201cconservative estimate\u201d.\n\nIn a recent study, the New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water estimates that currently only 35 per cent of onshore wind and 41 per cent of solar real estate potential in India is located in areas without historical contest over land \u2014 figures that will probably only worsen as the country makes strides towards its net zero aims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a big problem for the developers,\u201d Sambhav adds. \u201cMany projects get stalled or delayed.\u201d\n\nThose increasing constrictions come at a critical juncture for India\u2019s green energy drive as companies like Tata expand their renewable businesses. When the conglomerate, which has set up and is constructing nearly 17GW of non-fossil fuel power capacity, first revealed it would set up the solar park near Nandgaon, Tata described it as \u201canother step\u201d in its mission to establish clean energy solutions throughout India.\n\nYet for farmers, the project represents an existential threat to practices dating back to the 1970s, when the government allowed them to farm the reserved forest land to boost food production as part of India\u2019s agricultural Green Revolution.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is confusion over who holds the ultimate title of the more than 200 acres, a question that has now reached the High Court of Bombay. To secure the site outside Nandgaon, Tata, like many businesses, turned to a land \u201caggregator\u201d, or middleman, according to people familiar with the matter. One of the people said the land had long been \u201cdelisted\u201d as environmentally protected land.\n\nBut according to forest department officials and documents seen by the Financial Times, technically no notification was seemingly issued regarding its deforestation \u2014 meaning its sale should not have been authorised, despite it no longer being a wooded area.\n\nTata Power declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation. Viraj Profile, India\u2019s renewable energy ministry, Maharashtra\u2019s state forest department and the local government in Nashik district, where the project is based, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not against renewable development,\u201d says Raju Desale, the Maharashtra state secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress and an official with the Communist Party of India, which helped organise the farmer protests.\n\nBut with Indian bureaucrats under top-down pressure to open up real estate for green energy projects, Desale adds that \u201cthey encroached the land\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that land is [the farmers\u2019] livelihood\u201d.\n\nWhen India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to the podium in Glasgow at the 2021 COP26 climate summit, he surprised the crowd by setting the country\u2019s net zero target for 2070.\n\nThe announcement was seen as a major turnaround for the coal-rich country, whose government argues that developing nations, which are not to blame for historic emissions, should rightly tap fossil fuel resources at their disposal to power their industrial growth.\n\nModi\u2019s stated ambition highlighted a shift that was already under way, with India scaling up its renewable capacity spurred by a dramatic fall in the cost of equipment such as solar panels, and a rush of green investment into the country.\n\nBut the sector has hit a familiar problem in India. Competing demands for land in this densely populated nation of 1.4bn people have long been cited by businesses as a critical bottleneck to investment. About 60 per cent of India\u2019s land is farmed, compared with the 37 per cent world average, according to the World Bank, and agriculture is the main means of livelihood for the country\u2019s majority.\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis estimates India\u2019s net zero goal may require up to 75,000 square kilometres of land for solar energy alone \u2014 equivalent to the size of the Republic of Ireland or about 2 per cent of India\u2019s total area. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has also calculated that a single megawatt of solar power requires on average four acres of land.\n\n\u201cAvailability of adequate land is a constraint for economic development and infrastructure growth broadly in India, and solar energy is not immune,\u201d says Shayak Sengupta, India programme lead at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\n\n\u201cI suspect it will get more difficult to acquire land as projects spread geographically, especially as the most attractive parcels get used first.\u201d\n\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that land rights remain one of India\u2019s most sensitive political issues. Attempts by Modi\u2019s government to overhaul land acquisition laws in his more than decade-long rule have met fierce resistance. Massive protests by farmers in northern India forced the government to repeal controversial agricultural reforms in 2021, marking one of Modi\u2019s most significant policy reversals.\n\nIn practice, securing large, continuous tracts of land requires lengthy negotiations with vast numbers of farmers in a country where the average size of agricultural holdings shrank by about a third to 0.74 hectares in the five years through March 2022, according to a recent government survey. Renewable developers often have to design projects in a \u201csuboptimal way just by virtue of where you\u2019re able to procure your land\u201d, says the IFC\u2019s Pellmar.\n\nIndia\u2019s land market is also notoriously opaque, with a widespread absence of easy-to-access ownership records and complicated government acquisition rules. Developers often resort to middlemen to secure holdings, which opens the door to graft and competing claims.\n\nThose hurdles are frustrating corporate India, particularly carbon-heavy industries. \u201cIt\u2019s time-consuming,\u201d says Neha Soni, general manager for business development at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, which has built its own wind and solar capacity to curb factory emissions. \u201cLand is a scarce commodity, so it\u2019s a constraint.\u201d\n\nModi has pushed India\u2019s states to make more land available for renewable projects and many businesses now look to local governments for access to uncontested or barren land. Some states, including Maharashtra, have also allowed those setting up green energy parks to sidestep social and environmental impact assessment requirements.\n\n\u201cState and central governments have gotten creative in helping developers acquire land through leasing or offering government land,\u201d says Sengupta.\n\nBut even this approach has limitations. In many cases, governments free up state-owned \u201ccommon land\u201d or \u201cwasteland\u201d for renewable energy projects, despite the fact that these areas are often used by local pastoralists and impoverished farmers for grazing or cultivation. These communities, which typically lack formal legal rights, are frequently left without adequate compensation or recourse when the land is repurposed.\n\nSambhav at Land Conflict Watch says these types of battles have a common theme. \u201cGovernments often present land as free of encumbrances, but on the ground, developers face protests from locals who have used it for generations.\u201d\n\nOne potential solution mooted by energy experts is the wider deployment of so-called agrivoltaics \u2014 the dual use of solar panels typically raised above working farm land. Depending on the angle and space of the equipment, crops can be protected, or exposed to light and heat.\n\nThe first such project was tested in 2012 in the western India state of Gujarat. Since then more than a dozen pilots have been attempted. A study funded and published last year by the German Agency for International Cooperation calculated that potential agrivoltaic energy generation in India could reach anywhere between more than 3,000GW and almost 14,000GW.\n\nCharles Worringham, who contributes analysis on India\u2019s energy transition for IEEFA, says the potential of agrivoltaics to reduce land conflicts is \u201cextraordinarily promising\u201d and \u201ccould really benefit\u201d the country\u2019s vast rural economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got enormous potential, but there are fairly substantial financial barriers and policy barriers to get squared away,\u201d he adds.\n\nHolding back significant agrivoltaic generation is regulation and tax strictures across many Indian states that classify land for either agricultural or commercial use, forbidding dual use of farm land for business activity beyond harvesting.\n\nExperts say the commercial viability of multipurpose cropland producing renewable energy has also not yet been tested, and many farmers will be reluctant to gamble on new technology until it is more established.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been done at scale and in India often farmers learn from farmers, you learn from your neighbour,\u201d says Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water research institution. \u201cThe scale-up and acceleration of renewables in India is not going to come from one business model but an experiment with many.\u201d\n\nOther less land-intensive routes to net zero are being actively pursued by Modi\u2019s government, including the expansion of rooftop solar. In February last year his administration launched a subsidy programme covering up to 40 per cent of the costs of installing panels on residential properties. The aim is to cover 10mn households under the scheme by March 2027, up from 630,000 currently.\n\nOverall generation capacity of rooftop solar has expanded at a swift clip, adding more than 3GW to an almost 15.7GW total since April 2024 \u2014 though falling far short of an earlier target set by the Modi government to hit 100GW by 2022.\n\n\u201cRooftop solar could and should be part of the solution,\u201d says Pellmar from the IFC. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the ultimate answer, given the massive targets that the government of India has.\u201d\n\nFor now, many producers at the forefront of India\u2019s green energy ambitions still require large tracts of land, and some are bogged down in lengthy and heated contests. Shortly after its solar park near Nandgaon was raided and closed up, Tata Power filed a challenge against the action in the High Court of Bombay.\n\nAs the litigation winds its way through India\u2019s sluggish and overburdened legal system, Maharashtra\u2019s advocate general, the state\u2019s most senior legal adviser, asked for the project to be reopened and work recommence in the interim even as the case remains pending, according to the people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the FT.\n\nWhile the farmers outside Nandgaon are not party to the court dispute, many of them told the FT during a recent visit to the area that they remain angry, claiming that they had been ousted from their land. Following the forest department\u2019s raid, \u201cwe had expectations that everything would be all right\u201d, says 30-year-old Sanjay Tikaram Sonawane. \u201cBut then they started work again.\u201d\n\nSome are now despondent and say there is little support for them after years of petitioning the government to grant them title to a swath of territory that they have in practice been living off for generations. \u201cWe\u2019re on our own,\u201d adds Sonawane, as uniformed security guards from the surrounding and enclosed solar park keep careful watch nearby.Additional reporting by Andrea Rodrigues in Mumbai", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a8528845-dfe9-4121-a115-c475d0302d3e"}}, {"id": "9bf9682b-4547-484c-909a-feaf3fcdbde3", "event_name": "Few buyers for India\u2019s new electric cars", "blurb": "Also in this newsletter: Meta\u2019s troubles with the competition commission, and Gautami Gavankar\u2019s mantra", "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. It\u2019s going to be a busy news week. Donald Trump was just sworn in as the 47th US president, and he\u2019s already signed a raft of executive orders and rescinded dozens of Biden-era directives. FT experts will break down what his second term means at a subscriber-only webinar on Thursday \u2014 don\u2019t miss it.\n\nAlso busy this week is Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who is hosting a big inauguration dinner for Trump. Meanwhile in India, his company is hoping for a temporary reprieve from proceedings against it by the country\u2019s competition watchdog.\n\nBut first, electric vehicles are all the rage at this year\u2019s auto expo, even if they are hard to spot on our roads.\n\nElectric vehicles are getting a big push at this year\u2019s Bharat Mobility Global Expo (previously, auto expo). The Indian auto industry\u2019s biggest show kicked off with the prime minister on Friday making the case for \u201ceconomy and ecology\u201d, highlighting the government\u2019s focus on the development of green technologies and reducing the import bill for fossil fuels.\n\nIn March 2024, the government unveiled policies aimed at promoting India as a manufacturing destination for EVs. Companies investing $500mn in production facilities in the country are allowed to import electric cars as \u201ccompletely knocked down kits\u201d (where all the parts of the car are imported and assembled locally)\u00a0at a reduced customs duty of 15 per cent (from 70 per cent) for five years. Many Indian states have also announced their own incentive schemes for EV manufacturers.\n\nOver the weekend, several companies unveiled their EV offerings for India. Chinese carmaker BYD launched its electric sport utility vehicle, Sealion 7; Vietnam\u2019s VinFast announced it would be launching two electric SUVs later this year; and homegrown Maruti Suzuki launched an electric version of its Vitara model, among others.\n\nWhile two and three-wheelers have witnessed consumer enthusiasm, the same cannot be said for cars. The government is hoping EVs will constitute 30 per cent of passenger cars in India by 2030, but they only have about 2 per cent market share now.\n\nBattery life and charging infrastructure continue to be a significant problem. It takes nearly a day to charge a car from an AC socket. While companies do install wall box chargers, they are often vulnerable to theft. In urban India\u2019s unpredictable traffic and road conditions, range anxiety is a real issue. Access to charging points on highways is almost non-existent, making EVs a consideration for a second car in the household at best.\n\nThis is a bit of a chicken and egg situation for the industry. Car sales have to cross a certain threshold for manufacturers to invest more in the charging infrastructure but the poor charging infrastructure is a deterrent for higher sales. Indian customers are still following a wait and watch approach. While the government\u2019s EV push for manufacturing will drive investment and employment, it should also augment the charging infrastructure in order to make private investments in manufacturing a feasible option.\n\nDo you own an EV?

In the US, Mark Zuckerberg is busy currying favour with the new administration, hosting a black-tie dinner for Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration after ending fact-checking on Facebook and Meta\u2019s diversity initiative. In India, on Thursday, an appeals tribunal will decide whether Meta gets some reprieve from a $24.5mn fine and stringent conditions that India\u2019s anti-monopoly watchdog has imposed.\n\nIn November, the Competition Commission of India asked WhatsApp to stop sharing user data for advertising with other Meta entities, such as Facebook and Instagram, for a period of five years. This was after the agency\u2019s 2021 review raised concerns that users of the messaging app could not meaningfully opt-out from their model of data sharing across platforms.\u00a0The social media giant has reportedly claimed the order will force it to roll back or pause some of its services in India.\n\nIndia is WhatsApp\u2019s largest market, with nearly 500mn users, and with digital payments and ecommerce it is now more than just a messaging platform. Meta\u2019s advertising business model hinges on accessing users\u2019 phone numbers, transaction data and other behavioural and device information. Internet companies make it seem like personalised advertisement is a good thing for users, when in reality it is a better thing for themselves.

Great news from India\u2019s space agency, which yesterday announced it had managed a successful space docking (joining two fast moving satellites in space). India is the fourth country to manage this feat, after the US, Russia and China.\n\nIndia\u2019s software services sector could also do with some good news. Tech chief executives are keeping their fingers crossed that a Trump presidency will unleash animal spirits in American corporations, triggering higher spending on IT services. We\u2019ll take a look. But first, what are your job and salary prospects?\n\nWhere are the best jobs and what\u2019s your pay packet going to look like this year? According to the annual salary trends report published by Randstad, the best paying junior and mid-level jobs are found in Bengaluru, and senior management roles are the juiciest in Mumbai. (Excuse me for a minute while I cry in Delhi-NCR).\n\nSalaries in Bengaluru are 23 per cent and 9 per cent higher than the national average for junior and mid-levels respectively. For senior positions, Mumbai pay packets are 12 per cent higher than the national average. Surprisingly (at least to me), Bengaluru jobs are not just in the IT sector; the city leads in financial services, manufacturing, automotive, retail and consumer goods too. Mumbai (predictably) excels in finance and banking sector jobs.\n\nInternet and ecommerce \u2014 undoubtedly the growth industries currently \u2014 are the best paymasters, but salaries in the advertising, market research and public relations industries have taken a big leap too (26 per cent).\n\nBut to me, the real story is the collapse of Delhi-NCR. The report places it at rank seven (in tier 1 cities) for mid-level and senior executive pay. In both of these categories, salaries here are lower than the national average. Delhi-NCR is fifth at the junior level and the pay is a hair over the average, and it is consistently ranked seven (out of eight) in all the sectors the report analysed.\n\nTwo decades ago, when the shiny glass and chrome buildings emerged in Delhi-NCR\u2019s Gurgaon, it quickly became the hub of corporate India with large Indian conglomerates and big multinationals setting up headquarters. It was great for a while, but terrible air pollution and civic services increasingly lagging behind have really done a number on the quality of life in the national capital. The other issue is that the region is spread over three states, with different rules and standards, and there is no central authority responsible for its growth and upkeep.\n\nNow that you know where (not) to work, here\u2019s how much you can expect your pay to rise this year. A report published this week by Mercer estimates that salary increments in 2025 will be an average 9.4 per cent, a steady growth from 8 per cent in 2020. The automotive sector is expected to be the most generous, with 10 per cent salary increments (up from 8.8 per cent last year), followed by manufacturing and engineering at 9.7 per cent. Of the 1,550 companies that participated in this survey, 37 per cent plan to increase headcount.\n\nOverall, these are encouraging numbers. The jobs landscape for 2025 is looking good in India. But Delhi-ites, should we start a support group?\n\nWrite to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nOn Monday, when Donald Trump takes his oath of office, one section of Indian industry will be watching with hopeful anticipation. The IT services sector, which has had a difficult few years post-pandemic, is looking forward to a Trump bump. Here\u2019s why.\n\nOne, Trump has promised to reduce corporate taxes. Industry experts expect that the money saved on tax will be directed towards technology expansion. Second, the uncertainty over the elections are over and the US economy is expected to grow. Half of India\u2019s IT services revenues come from North America and when the US grows, they grow too. In fact, it\u2019s already showing signs of a revival (see graph above). HSBC analysts estimate industry growth will be 6 per cent in the next financial year, up from about 3-4 per cent over the past two years.\n\nOur IT services companies employ 5mn people and earn revenues of $125bn, and it needs all the good news it can get. But a Trump presidency is not without its challenges for the industry. The issue of H1B visas has been raging even before Trump takes office. The president\u2019s Maga base has come out all guns blazing against IT jobs going predominantly to Indians. Plus, the nuances of the US economy in 2025 are hazy. If the new administration imposes the tariffs it has been threatening, inflationary pressures will rise.\n\nThis is a story which should not be viewed through a binary lens. My sense is that all of these scenarios will come to bear. There will be more money funding technology services but there will also be the overhang of Trump\u2019s America First policies. The next few quarters will probably be positive for the industry, but it would be foolish to extrapolate that to the entirety of Trump\u2019s term.\n\nIndia\u2019s trade deficit narrowed to a three-month low last month. Key imports were precious metals, petroleum and electronics. The government revised November\u2019s gold import figures by $5bn, attributing it to a mistake of double counting. Here\u2019s the data for December.\n\nI plan to start watching Black Warrant on Netflix this weekend. Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, this is an inside look at Delhi\u2019s notorious Tihar jail. The series is based on the book of the same name, written by Sunil Gupta, a former superintendent at the prison, and journalist Sunetra Choudhury. I read the book when it was published in 2019. It\u2019s a gripping account with familiar names from newspaper headlines. Early reviews of the show are promising.\n\nMy friend (and former boss) Sanjay Kalra sent me a playlist of Rashid Khan\u2019s songs. I don\u2019t know much about Hindustani classical, but these songs were accessible even for my musically-challenged brain. I plan to properly get into it this weekend. (Write to me if you\u2019re interested. I\u2019ll share the playlist).\n\nThe Indian national trust for art and cultural heritage (Intach) organises some lovely walks in Delhi. It\u2019s a great opportunity to learn about the history and culture of this beautiful city. (So what if we are underpaid, we get to gaze at Humayun\u2019s tomb). After two failed attempts, when I registered but couldn\u2019t make it, I\u2019m hoping to be third-time lucky and go on an Afghan food walk with them on Saturday evening. Fingers crossed for some naan and kebabs.\n\nWhat are adventure enthusiasts fuelling themselves with in order to be able to summit Mount Everest in one week?\n\nSend your answer to indiabrief@ft.com and check Tuesday\u2019s newsletter to see if you were the first one to get it right.\n\nOn Monday we asked: How many hours of work are ideal in a week?

In doing so he sparked a furore by touching on twin obsessions of the country\u2019s professional class: long work hours and their toll on family life.\n\n\u201cI regret I am not able to make you work on Sundays, to be honest,\u201d the chair of the conglomerate Larsen & Toubro told staff in a corporate town hall event in Mumbai.\n\n\u201cIf I could make you work on Sundays, I would be more happy because I work on Sundays also.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do sitting at home?\u201d he added. \u201cHow long can you stare at your wife, how long can the wife stare at her husband? Come on, get to the office and start working.\u201d\n\nThough the meeting was meant to stay within company walls, a video was published on Reddit and then shared widely online, to Indians\u2019 widespread outrage and bemusement.\n\nThis is not the first time a business leader has admonished employees in India for the hours they work.\n\nNR Narayana Murthy, chair of outsourcing giant Infosys, invited similar controversy last year after calling on India\u2019s youth to work 70 hours a week to compete with the likes of China, and urged them to avoid picking up \u201cnot-so-desirable habits from the west\u201d.\n\nBack in 2011 the late Ratan Tata, chair of the Tata Group, questioned the work ethic of British managers after his group\u2019s acquisitions of Jaguar Land Rover and Corus, claiming \u201cnobody is willing to go the extra mile\u201d.\n\nIn a country with a conservative government that prizes consensus and bristles at criticism, Indian corporate bosses tend to keep public statements workmanlike and patriotic, if not studiously bland.\n\nSubrahmanyan\u2019s comments have prompted attention for their frank outspokenness and reference to staring at one\u2019s wife, which some Indians found bizarre and which helped the video to go viral.\n\n\u201cHe made it sound as if being at home and being with your spouse is a terrible waste of time,\u201d said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of Teamlease, an Indian staffing company.\n\nSome uxorious Indian men have in recent days posted pictures of themselves staring lovingly at their wives; others rechristened Sunday as \u201cStareday\u201d, which is now circulating online as a hashtag.\n\nLeading Indian chief executives have piled on \u2014 some perhaps sensing an opportunity for virtue-signalling or schadenfreude.\n\n\u201cMy wife is wonderful,\u201d Anand Mahindra, CEO of the eponymous family conglomerate, said at a conference this week in New Delhi. \u201cI love staring at her.\u201d\n\nMahindra added that the debate that had been unleashed was \u201cin the wrong direction\u201d and should be about the quality of work, not the quantity.\n\nLarsen & Toubro has largely sat out the controversy, initially backing its chair in a statement saying that \u201cextraordinary outcomes require extraordinary effort\u201d. Colleagues say he was not serious. Subrahmanyan has declined to comment.\n\nThe question of how many hours executives in India should work has led to serious debates about the country\u2019s economic growth.\n\nAway from the online japes and memes, Subrahmanyan\u2019s comments touched a nerve because India\u2019s hard-working professionals are feeling the pinch from persistent inflation and stagnating wages. These in turn feed often-voiced fears that India \u2014 no matter how hard or long people work \u2014 is heading for a \u201cmiddle income trap\u201d, in which its huge population grows old before the economy becomes rich.\n\nWhile reliable data is not available on India\u2019s average working hours, long commutes running to two or three hours both ways are common in Indian cities.\n\nRajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, said Indian companies should move away from \u201carchaic and regressive policies\u201d of enforcing long working hours and instead focus on \u201cspeed at the front line\u201d.\n\nOthers were more forthright. \u201c90 hours a week?\u201d Harsh Goenka, chair of RPG Group, fumed in a post on X. \u201cWhy not rename Sunday to \u2018Sun-duty\u2019 and make \u2018day off\u2019 a mythical concept!\u201d\n\njohn.reed@ft.com", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/96aefd59-e079-40ae-a334-03c53d02d6a0"}}, {"id": "b5305775-b959-4f36-b86b-ee08af5c2846", "event_name": "Gods, Guns and Missionaries \u2014 exploding the myth of a singular, \u2018true\u2019 Hinduism", "blurb": "Manu S Pillai\u2019s deft exploration of four centuries of the faith reveals its underlying complexities", "date": "2025-01-1500:00:00.0", "body": "A book about Hinduism which begins with a maharaja\u2019s cows sounds a little like a Rudyard Kipling tale, replete with spices, mystery and \u201cbackward\u201d traditions. But in the hands of Manu S Pillai, Madho Singh II\u2019s journey from Jaipur in the west of India to imperial London for Edward VII\u2019s coronation in 1902 becomes the gateway to a deft exploration of what Hinduism actually means as a faith. Drawing on the lives of missionaries, maharajas and men of the Dutch, French and British East India Companies, Pillai builds the story of a system marked by adaptability, dynamism and compromise rather than ossified archaisms.\n\nHinduism is often imagined as a monolith of arcane and ancient rituals, in spite of the efforts of external invaders. In India itself, the image of a \u201cfaith under siege\u201d is a core part of the Hindu nationalist rhetoric wielded by the Bharatiya Janata party \u2014 a party that has now led the world\u2019s most populous nation for more than a decade.\n\nExploring four crucial centuries of Hinduism\u2019s often terse, sometimes violent and always complex relationship with other faiths, Pillai explodes the myth of a singular, unchanging, \u201ctrue\u201d Hinduism. At the same time, he lays out the factors that allowed Hindu nationalists to forge a seemingly singular, muscular identity which has come to define Hinduism for many in the 21st century.\n\nHe argues that even before the arrival of imperial powers, Hinduism was hardly a settled affair, emerging instead from \u201c[Brahmins\u2019] negotiations with a bewildering variety of counter-thoughts and alternate visions\u201d. India\u2019s priestly class was not unified, adds Pillai, adapting to local traditions ranging from sun worship to matrilineal succession as needed.\n\nMatters only become more complicated with the arrival of Europeans in India at the end of the 15th century. Early travelogues read rather like a rejected Indiana Jones script, full of human sacrifice, demon worship and libidinous, treacherous women. Vasco da Gama, upon arriving in Kerala in 1498, was less quick to judge: he entered a Hindu temple and participated in rituals, dismissing frescoes of \u201cmulti-armed beings with big teeth\u201d as local forms of saints. And as some priests engaged with Brahmins, they found that the trappings of many gods were simply a humanised vision of something more akin to a familiar and orthodox monotheism. A recognition of spiritual kinship led Italian missionary Roberto de Nobili to swap his cassock for the robes of local priests in an effort to better win over converts.\n\nNot all interactions were so harmonious. Portuguese padres in Goa, facing the pressure of the Reformation at home, clamped down on \u201cpaganism\u201d abroad by burning temples. One, Father Acquaviva, disappointed at the tolerance he found at the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great, received his desired martyrdom after erecting a cross at a destroyed Hindu temple. The British East India Company shifted from distrust of missionaries as an impediment to trade to support for its \u201ccivilising\u201d mission thanks to pious parliamentarians and pressure groups. Among the catalysts for the Great Rebellion of 1857, Pillai argues, were evangelicals waving Christian texts at Hindu festivals.\n\nThe message throughout is that Hinduism is a living tradition defined more by variation than a singularity of thought and that those who would come to call themselves \u201cHindus\u201d were more than passive subjects. Priests and potentates reshaped their beliefs in ways deemed more acceptable or sophisticated, consciously rewriting older texts to remove imagery considered embarrassing for the mores of the time. Their discussions with colonial powers were not merely those of vassals lapping up to masters, but of reflective thinkers adapting to a shifting world.\n\nPillai also explores the shaping of Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) identity and how outside pressures knitted a huge variety of traditions into something like a unified whole (albeit imperfectly). The history of conquerors is central to a kind of postcolonial paranoia that sees Hindus\u2019 failure to resist as rooted in their naivety and good nature. The required remedy to resist cultural annihilation, proponents say, is to adopt an equally belligerent stance, bringing all the faithful into the fold.\n\nPillai avoids straying into the present; there are no references to the BJP or Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the text ends (chronologically) in 2003 with the unveiling of a portrait of Vinayak Savarkar, the father of Hindutva. This is not a weakness: to end with a deep dive into the BJP would suggest that the now prevalent nationalist vision of Hinduism is the religion\u2019s \u201cend point\u201d rather than a single strain.\n\nThe book closes with Bijay Chand Mahtab, maharaja of Burdwan, almost informing the pope of the \u201crevolting\u201d idolatry of Madonna shrines in early 20th century Italy. That inversion of early monstrous travelogues is more than a reminder of the underlying complexities of Hinduism; it also reflects the deep similarities between faiths. Those parallels were visible in the Enlightenment and earlier, but are increasingly at risk in an age of narrow populist agendas worldwide.\n\nGods, Guns and Missionaries: The Making of the Modern Hindu Identity by Manu S Pillai Allen Lane \u00a335, 624 pages\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Caf\u00e9 and follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/04cbeb04-ad5d-4452-bfa5-612fb86e2c20"}}, {"id": "9d730a4c-0637-40fd-a523-5d308f9693ae", "event_name": "Weakening rupee puts India interest rate cuts in doubt", "blurb": "Currency\u2019s decline and its implications for inflation add to doubts about health of world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy", "date": "2025-01-1500:00:00.0", "body": "A drop in the value of India\u2019s rupee has shaken expectations that the new head of the central bank will quickly cut interest rates to stimulate the country\u2019s flagging economy.\n\nThe currency has repeatedly hit lows and a 0.7 per cent fall against the dollar on Monday was its biggest one-day dip in nearly two years.\n\nThat decline and its implications for inflation have shattered the previously near-uniform consensus among economists that Reserve Bank of India governor Sanjay Malhotra and fellow monetary policy setters will next month cut the benchmark repo rate from 6.5 per cent, the level it has been held at for nearly two years.\n\nThe falling rupee is only one of a number of indicators taking the shine off of what remains the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy.\n\nIndia registered a sharp drop in year-on-year GDP growth to 5.4 per cent in the quarter through to the end of September, the lowest level in nearly two years, amid a slowdown in government spending, waning consumption and weak corporate earnings.\n\n\u201cThe rupee fall is serious for the new RBI governor,\u201d said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, adding that it had \u201cmuddied the view\u201d that there would be a headline rate cut at Malhotra\u2019s first policy meeting, which opens just a few days after the central government lays out its annual budget on February 1.\n\n\u201cA freefall has implications for imported inflation and hence monetary policy, which is the conundrum,\u201d Sabnavis said.\n\nIndia relies on overseas suppliers for almost 90 per cent of its oil consumption, making it particularly vulnerable to a rise in crude prices that followed new US sanctions on Russian producers. Robust recent US economic data has also cast doubt on the need for the Federal Reserve to lower rates, helping strengthen the dollar.\n\nStubbornly persistent inflation, which has eroded the spending power of hundreds of millions of poor and middle-class Indian households, lies at the heart of the RBI\u2019s dilemma.\n\nFuelled by soaring vegetable prices, headline inflation breached the upper 6 per cent limit of the central bank\u2019s target band in October, though prices have since cooled with the rate slowing to 5.2 per cent in December.\n\nMalhotra, who took office last month, had said he expected India\u2019s economy to recover in 2025. He indicated the RBI would prioritise supporting \u201ca higher growth path\u201d after his predecessor Shaktikanta Das was criticised by the government for keeping borrowing costs elevated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy environment for the new governor,\u201d said Trinh Nguyen, emerging Asia economist at Natixis, adding that \u201cIndia is not alone in this conundrum\u201d with most developing nations suffering from the strong dollar. \u201cBut fundamentally, I think growth will prevail as a priority even if a rapidly weakening rupee is a concern.\u201d\n\nThe RBI has regularly intervened to prop up the currency, burning through almost $70bn of its foreign exchange reserves since they reached a record high of $705bn in September.\n\nSome economists speculate that the more recent lack of strong RBI action to stem the rupee\u2019s fall may mark a shift in stance under Malhotra towards a more market-driven view of the currency that could boost exports. The RBI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther experts are more sanguine about the impact of the rupee\u2019s decline and believe the RBI has plenty of room to manoeuvre given an overall trend of declining inflation and the central bank\u2019s still considerable reserves.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as big a deal as it\u2019s being made out to be,\u201d said Miguel Chanco, chief emerging Asia economist at research consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. The rupee\u2019s more than 4 per cent depreciation against the dollar over the past year remained \u201cfairly manageable\u201d, Chanco said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that it\u2019s probably been due a downshift for some time, having looked pricey on a real effective exchange rate basis over the past 18 months or so,\u201d he said.\n\nMore broadly, while the RBI and India\u2019s government last month slashed their growth forecasts for the coming year to their lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic, the central bank said the economy was showing signs of bottoming out.\n\nChanco said that view might be too optimistic, given that India\u2019s fiscal and monetary policy remained tight, households were weighed down with debt and industrial capacity utilisation still was not at levels high enough to spark a fresh cycle of investment.\n\n\u201cWe probably have at least one more big downshift in headline GDP growth,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, another economist said the rebound in government capital expenditure that had been put on hold during last year\u2019s general election could also bode well for a revival of the Indian economy in the months to come.\n\n\u201cStructurally the economy is resilient,\u201d said Poonam Gupta, director-general of the National Council of Applied Economic Research in New Delhi. \u201cIt\u2019s a cyclical slowdown which timely policy actions can easily reverse.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/68250775-1c6d-4652-8423-89d55deeba45"}}, {"id": "0866e095-fa3f-4b67-add2-c631e2f6d52d", "event_name": "Indian IT outsourcers look to Trump bump to revive fortunes", "blurb": "After years of anaemic growth in largest market, sector expects promised deregulation to encourage tech spending", "date": "2025-01-1400:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s vast information technology outsourcing sector is hoping for a revival of its fortunes under a second Donald Trump presidency, with an industry that derives more than half its revenues from the US expecting incentives for its customers there to increase spending.\n\nWith the new administration promising to slash corporate taxes and tame red tape, India\u2019s $128bn annual revenue back office and consultancy sector, with its huge campuses across cities from Bengaluru to Pune, sees opportunity in its largest market after years of anaemic demand and growth. \u201cMr Trump in the past has been very business savvy,\u201d said Atul Soneja, chief operating officer at Tech Mahindra \u2014 the IT business of the Mahindra Group conglomerate \u2014 in an interview in Bengaluru. \u201cWe should hopefully start seeing the benefit.\u201d\n\nIT and business process outsourcing is one of India\u2019s most important and global-facing industries, employing more than 5mn people in a country that has thus far been unable to provide large numbers of well-paid and formal job opportunities for its enormous labour force.\n\nThe sector enjoyed a surge of business as clients invested in digital services during the coronavirus pandemic. But that led to Indian tech giants becoming bloated after a hiring splurge, and the industry was hit as corporates cut back on spending with global economic pressures increasing.\n\nTata Consultancy Services, India\u2019s largest IT company, which last week reported a fifth straight decline in quarterly revenue in North America, expects a better year, in part due to improving client spending as Trump takes office this week.\n\n\u201cOnce the new administration comes in, that will also remove any uncertainty,\u201d said K Krithivasan, TCS chief executive. \u201cThere will be more confidence in discretionary programmes coming into the next financial year.\u201d\n\nNandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder and chair of India\u2019s second-largest IT services company Infosys, told the Financial Times in November that the \u201cbull case\u201d for the industry would be that Trump\u2019s presidency would \u201cunleash market deregulation\u201d, allowing companies to expand, while spurring more mergers and takeovers, all providing business to India\u2019s outsourcers.\n\nHis comments were echoed soon after by Rishad Premji, chair of rival Wipro, who said he believed Trump\u2019s administration would be \u201cvery pro-business and pro-growth, which helps all of our customers, which ultimately helps partners here in India and the world over\u201d.\n\nHSBC analysts estimate the industry will see growth accelerate to 6 per cent in the next financial year, up from about 3-4 per cent over the past two years, adding that the US outlook is now positive.\n\n\u201cAny tax cuts would drive more technology spending, that\u2019s a fair assumption,\u201d said Sid Pai, the Bengaluru-based co-founder of venture capital tech investor Siana Capital Management, who expected \u201csteady growth\u201d across the sector.\n\nThe renewed optimism comes as US tech executives have been beating a path to India in recent months. Last week, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella set forth a $3bn investment, while in October, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang came to Mumbai and announced a batch of artificial intelligence partnerships with the country\u2019s biggest conglomerates and outsourcing giants.However, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d protectionist stance promises to impose dramatic tariffs on countries \u2014 damaging growth, fuelling inflation and leading to the Federal Reserve being more cautious on lowering interest rates, according to a recent FT poll of more than 220 economists.\u201cA large part of demand recovery for IT services companies is dependent on how the US economy performs in 2025,\u201d said Kumar Rakesh, a Mumbai-based associate director of equity research at BNP Paribas, warning conditions for the sector could worsen if policy changes were to boost inflation and force a pause or even a reversal in rate cuts.HSBC analysts noted that Trump tax cuts in 2017 did not necessarily have a clear impact on tech spending. During the last Trump presidency, the industry also fell foul of tightening restrictions on the high-skilled H-1B visa programme, which is overwhelmingly used by Indian nationals.\n\nWhile Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s biggest tech industry backer, has argued there is \u201ca dire shortage\u201d of IT engineers in America, Indian outsourcers have since significantly reduced their dependency on H1-B workers in the US where they have offices servicing clients locally. Rakesh said less than 1 per cent of outsourcing industry employees now work on such visas. More widely, economists and industry figures in India expect the world\u2019s most populous nation, which has been edging closer into Washington\u2019s orbit and whose leader, Narendra Modi, shares good relations with Trump, could be shielded from the worst of the US leader\u2019s impulses.\n\n\u201cThe relationships between the two leaders have been very strong in the past as well, so we expect that to continue,\u201d said Tech Mahindra\u2019s Soneja.Teresa John, deputy head of research at Mumbai brokerage Nirmal Bang, who recently published research on the potential impact of \u201cTrumponomics\u201d on India, said overall the country was likely to \u201cbe relatively insulated\u201d compared with other Asian nations, such as China, given its lower trade surplus with the US.\n\n\u201cUS growth is going to hold up,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will see that flowing through to the Indian IT sector.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c41220a4-d37b-4323-a7cc-4e56eb0ae910"}}, {"id": "26c202a4-d5bf-461a-b90e-6d2aa0dd9b5f", "event_name": "Infosys and Cognizant slug it out", "blurb": "Also in this newsletter: Real money games get a breather and the Kumbh Mela in numbers", "date": "2025-01-1400:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. India\u2019s inflation for December was 5.22 per cent, a four-month low, thanks to some moderation in food prices. While the trend is encouraging, it is much higher than the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s medium-term target of 4 per cent. Is this enough for a rate cut next month?\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter, we take a look at the real money gaming industry, which got a small breather on Friday when the Supreme Court asked for a temporary pause in tax proceedings against 49 companies. But first, the war of titans: India\u2019s software service giants Infosys and Cognizant slug it out in a court in Texas.\n\nThe battle between two Indian(ish) technology majors escalated, with Infosys, on Friday, filing a counter lawsuit against Cognizant. This is the story so far: in August 2024,\u00a0Cognizant subsidiary TriZetto, which provides technology services to the US healthcare industry, took Infosys to court. It accused Infosys of building a competing program by unlawfully extracting data from its proprietary software. Now, five months later, Infosys has come out all guns blazing, not only rejecting these accusations but also levelling charges of anti-competitive practices against its rival.\n\nInfosys, in its counter suit, alleges that Cognizant obstructed the development of its healthcare platform (Helix) by poaching key personnel and placing restrictive contractual barriers. The suit specifically alleges that Ravi Kumar, who quit Infosys in October 2022 and became Cognizant\u2019s chief executive four months later, deliberately delayed the launch of Helix while he was transitioning to his new job. Infosys is seeking a jury trial and has demanded three times the damages it allegedly suffered, plus legal costs.\n\nInfosys and Cognizant have long been rivals, fighting over both client contracts as well as employees. These lawsuits also highlight the intensely competitive landscape in which Indian IT companies operate in the US, with little differentiation in the services they provide. Much is at stake for both companies. A protracted legal battle serves neither\u2019s interests, but since things have got this far, a quick retreat by either party also looks unlikely.\n\nDo you have an inside scoop on this? Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nReal money gaming, a sector which hasn\u2019t had any good news in a while, got a breather on Friday when the Supreme Court placed a temporary halt on tax proceedings that would have cost 49 companies a whopping Rs1.1tn (about $14bn). Stocks of Delta Corp and OnMobile, which both run platforms that allow users to play games such as rummy for actual money, rose by 6.44 per cent and 2.38 per cent respectively on the news. But this is just a temporary reprieve, with the final hearing set for March 18.\n\nFor years, flush with funds and abundant user interest, real money gaming companies lobbied hard to convince the government that these were games of skill, and not of chance, a distinction that allowed them to fall in the 18 per cent tax rate. But in October 2023, the finance ministry grouped these games together with lotteries and gambling.\u00a0Not only would the companies have to start paying tax at 28 per cent, the tax would be computed on the value of the bet \u2014 not just on the winnings. The companies argue that the high rate of tax will lead to a surge in unauthorised gaming as operators go underground.\n\nThere are two significant factors at play. First, online gambling is a serious societal issue \u2014 one with devastating consequences especially in the low-income sections of the population. Second, in general, sin taxes are a populist tool in the government\u2019s arsenal and it is more likely to use them than not. While real money gaming is a big business opportunity and India\u2019s affluent are keen on spending money on it, the government\u2019s preference will be to regulate for the larger good.\n\nIn the aftermath of the government\u2019s October 2023 decision, several companies decided to move their headquarters outside India. This might just be the one industry the government is not going to invest heavily in luring back.\n\nThe Maha Kumbh, which comes around once every 12 years, started yesterday and will continue until February 26.

By its own account it is now in the final, \u201cclimb\u201d phase, merging its sprawling operations, driving profitability and enhancing customer value, and taking Indian aviation to the global stage.\n\nNew aircraft from 2023\u2019s huge 470-jet Boeing and Airbus order are beginning to arrive at an average rate of one every six days, allowing Air India to open more routes. Meanwhile, the company is overhauling tired interiors in some of its older aircraft \u2014 a process that has been delayed by supply chain bottlenecks in the global industry.\n\nWilson completed two mergers in 2024 \u2014 between Air India and Vistara, its joint venture with Singapore Airlines, and between its two regional airlines, Air India Express and Air Asia India.\n\nThis is a corporate turnaround story in sync with India\u2019s triumphalist narrative under the Narendra Modi government of a rising nation proudly shedding its past of colonial oppression and economic underperformance.\n\nFor Tata, the business opportunity is clear: if Air India successfully transforms its fleet, upgrades its service and flies more new routes between India and Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, it can win back customers who had sworn off it, including passengers among India\u2019s large diaspora.\n\nThe airline is still in the red: it reported a net loss of Rs44bn ($520mn) in the financial year to the end of March 2024, narrower than the Rs114bn it had lost the previous year.\n\nFor some, the change is not fast enough. Indian media and social media have revelled in Air India\u2019s mishaps since Tata bought it, from missing luggage and damaged seats to poor food and two emergency landings in Russia for safety reasons in 2023 and 2024.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting impatient about why it is taking so long for Air India to be rejuvenated, to be made into a world-class airline, which has been the ambition of the Tatas,\u201d said Jitender Bhargava, a former executive director of the airline and author of a book on the carrier, The Descent of Air India.\n\nWilson insisted the turnaround is on track, saying it was a feat to have managed two mergers, an overhaul of the Air India brand \u2014 including a new logo, uniforms and livery \u2014 and to have recruited more than 9,000 new employees, reducing the workforce\u2019s average age from 54 to 35.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no airline that I\u2019m aware of in history that has done all these things at the same time, and done it in two and a bit years,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Tata bought Air India, it was struggling to pay vendors and had 30 aircraft on the ground that, Wilson recalled, the airline was cannibalising for parts to keep the rest of the fleet in the air. Staff were using private Gmail accounts for company business. Air India was the last airline using its ancient, mainframe computer reservation system.\n\nTata committed $200mn to revamping its IT system and consolidated 63 offices into a single campus in Gurugram.\n\nIn February 2023 it announced what was then the biggest jet order in aviation history for 470 aircraft, later to be pipped by its biggest domestic rival IndiGo, which ordered 500 jets from Airbus in June.\n\nWilson also set about refurbishing interiors and sourcing components for Air India\u2019s existing fleet, including the 30 grounded jets that had been raided for parts.\n\n\u201cSomething like 30,000 components we had to find \u2014 and that was just one aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\nDelivery of some of the Boeing aircraft, he added, had been delayed by the recent strike by machinists at the US group, further straining a \u201ctight market\u201d for delivery of aircraft and componentry.\n\n\u201cEvery airline is affected,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just probably a little bit more frustrating for us, in an aircraft and product renewal process with an appetite for massive expansion.\u201d\n\nAir India has, however, managed to induct 100 aircraft in less than two years, allowing it to launch more than 100 new routes.\n\nOutside critics of the airline say Wilson should have taken a more radical approach to overhauling its existing fleet, which still includes old aircraft with dowdy interiors on many domestic routes. Indian media have made headline news of customer complaints about its \u201cunclean, worn-off seats\u201d or a traveller on a New York-bound flight who said she was served an omelette with a cockroach in it.\n\n\u201cThe problem with Air India was never about the branding,\u201d said Mark Martin, an aviation analyst and chief executive of Martin Consulting. \u201cThe problem with Air India was the quality of the product \u2014 the seats, the cabins, the heat exchanges, the in-flight entertainment \u2014 and the first priority should have been to get the 180 existing aircraft back online.\u201d\n\nBecause some of the jets were older and their parts no longer in production, Wilson has had to turn to Air India sister company Tata Technologies to help reverse engineer plastics, trays and recliners for business and first-class seats. (A business seat in a Boeing 787, he said, had 11 different actuators to control its position.)\n\nAir India still faces entrenched scepticism among Indians who abandoned it during its decades of decline. It also faces vigorous competition from the foreign carriers that fly to India and from IndiGo, which introduced an \u201cIndiGo Stretch\u201d business class on the Delhi-Mumbai route last month, taking the flag carrier on directly for its highest-value customers.\n\nBhargava thinks that in a growing Indian market both Air India and IndiGo \u201cwill give any Gulf airline a run for the money\u201d once they take delivery of all of their long-haul aircraft on order.\n\nWilson acknowledges the competition, but points to small victories, such as Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller having recently voted Air India the world\u2019s 12th-best airline.\n\n\u201cWe do see this as a bit of a national mission, to make a new Air India,\u201d he said. \u201cIf and when we get it right \u2014 and I\u2019m quite convinced it\u2019s when \u2014 there will be a huge level of support and engagement and customer loyalty that will come.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo I\u2019d rather there be some interest than no interest.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ace7407-2e4f-4729-b747-7f21ffe90d85"}}, {"id": "4fb9b074-0b44-45ef-9e50-4482825ad51e", "event_name": "Nadella\u2019s micro gift to India", "blurb": "Also in this newsletter: the bull run in defence stocks, and the car industry\u2019s software problem", "date": "2025-01-1000:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. Last week, we talked about India\u2019s slowing GDP and now official estimates have placed it at 6.4 per cent, the slowest year since the pandemic. Over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll assess the impact this will have on our investment and consumption climate and what the government\u2019s Budget proposals to spur growth are likely to be. In today\u2019s newsletter, we also take a look at the bull run in defence-sector stocks in Indian equities. But first, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive is on a whirlwind tour of India, leaving a trail of gifts behind him. It\u2019s good news, but could it have been better?\n\nMicrosoft chief Satya Nadella was in India earlier this week, dropping gifts like a belated Santa Claus. Local news reports led with the $3bn investment that the company is planning to make over the next two years in India. This money is mostly for developing artificial intelligence and cloud services under Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing platform, and part of it will also go towards training 10mn Indians on AI skills by 2030. Nadella described this as the single largest expansion that Microsoft has ever done in India.\n\nNadella is excited by the level of development activity going on in India; some 17mn Indian developers are on GitHub, a platform that allows developers to create, store and share their code, which Microsoft acquired in 2018. He expects Indians to be the largest community on GitHub by 2028. Indian developers are working on more than 30,500 generative AI projects.\n\nThese numbers are interesting but not phenomenal. The global AI arms race, at this point, is clearly between the US and China. American technology companies are hoping the incoming Donald Trump administration will not place any regulatory shackles on the development of AI in order to stay ahead of China. These groups include Microsoft itself, whose president Brad Smith wrote an impassioned blog post on the topic earlier this week.\n\nWhile a few Indian companies are doing some interesting work on AI, at this point they are nowhere near any significant breakthroughs in technology or product development that would make them leading global players. Microsoft\u2019s $3bn investment in India should also be viewed within the company\u2019s global plans: it expects to spend $80bn this year developing data centres globally, with more than half of that figure invested in the US.\n\nMy take may seem negative about India to some, especially those who feel we should be taking this chance to revel in the praise Nadella has heaped on the country. I see my view as that of a concerned parent urging their child to prepare before an examination. In investing in our technological future, it will serve us better to be ambitious and driven at this point than to be sitting back in smug satisfaction. All I am doing is looking Microsoft\u2019s gift horse in the mouth and finding it to be too small.\n\nKnow an Indian company that is doing groundbreaking work on AI? Tell me about it at indiabrief@ft.com\n\nThe Make in India initiative is paying off, quite literally, in the arms and armaments industry.\u00a0There\u2019s a bull run in stocks of companies that are engaged in defence production. This trend has not gone unnoticed by India\u2019s mutual fund industry, with four large asset management companies launching funds that are dedicated to investing in this sector. Companies such as Hindustan Aeronautics, missile maker Bharat Dynamics and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, the country\u2019s largest naval shipyard, have seen their order books swell as the Modi government pushes the military to shop locally. Consequently, their share prices have significantly outperformed the index.\n\nWhile state-owned companies are still the largest manufacturers of defence equipment, big Indian conglomerates such as the Adani Group, Larsen & Toubro and the Tata Group have started or augmented their investments in the sector in recent years. India is hoping to eventually become an exporter in the arms business, after being the world\u2019s largest importer for more than two decades.\n\nThese are great developments for India\u2019s manufacturing sector as well as the defence industry. I am less enthused about the defence funds. The dominant companies in the sector are government owned, with very little free float in the market. Big fund houses buying and selling this limited float can lead to high price fluctuations, and it is anyone\u2019s guess whether retail investors are aware of these risks.\n\nLaunching funds with sectoral themes to quickly mop up some fresh funds is an old habit in the asset management business, something I remember writing about 20 years ago as a young reporter covering the industry. Every once in a while, it leads to some finger wagging from the regulator and then it is business as usual. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nAs cars get more software heavy, US automakers are seeing an increasing number of software-related car recalls.\n\nI am reading Character Limit: How Elon Musk Destroyed Twitter (love a title that is direct and to the point), written by journalists Kate Conger and Ryan Mac.

Today\u2019s economically dynamic India is his legacy. Almost as significant is the example he gave of intelligent, informed and honourable public service. Singh took ideas seriously, yet was unfailingly courteous and open to the ideas of others. I had the privilege of knowing him from 1974, when I was a senior economist in the World Bank\u2019s India Division and he was the government of India\u2019s chief economic adviser. He was one of the greatest men I have known.\n\nSingh\u2019s most important achievements as a policymaker were made during his years as finance minister from 1991 to 1996. He was appointed, to his surprise, by prime minister PV Narasimha Rao, at a time of a huge foreign exchange crisis. Cometh the hour; cometh the man. He seized the opportunity to deliver radical reform of an anti-trade and anti-market policy regime that had crippled India\u2019s economy since independence. He had known of these errors since he wrote India\u2019s Export Trends, his doctoral thesis at Oxford, published in 1964.\n\nWith the prime minister\u2019s backing, Singh duly transformed India\u2019s policy regime. The reforms ultimately included radical trade liberalisation, deregulation of industry, liberalisation of finance and a shift to a more modern monetary regime, without direct monetary financing of the government by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nThe subsequent transformation in Indian economic performance is dramatic. Over the 41 years from 1950 to 1991, real GDP per head (measured at purchasing power parity) increased by 108 per cent. Over the shorter period of 32 years from 1991 to 2023, it rose by 360 per cent. This was a jump from trend annual growth of 1.6 per cent to one of 5.2 per cent. Roughly speaking, the post-1991 trend and the broad policy regime have persisted ever since.\n\nThe past three decades, then, have transformed India. Whether this will be sustained in the decades ahead is unknown. Whether India will become the developed country it aspires to be in 2047, a century after independence, is also unknown and, in my view, rather unlikely. But India\u2019s population is the largest in the world, at 1.4bn and rising. If growth continues, it will be an economic superpower by then.\n\nYet China\u2019s real GDP per head rose by 1,150 per cent between 1991 and 2023, \u2014 an astounding trend annual rate of 8.4 per cent. Moreover, surprisingly, the share of manufacturing in Indian GDP has fallen, according to the World Bank, not risen, as one would have expected, from 16 per cent in 1991 to 13 per cent in 2023. Again, while ratios of trade to GDP soared after the reforms, they have fallen back somewhat more recently.\n\nInequality also seems to have risen. According to the World Inequality Database, the share in income of the top 1 per cent soared from 10 per cent in 1991 to 23 per cent in 2023, while the share of the top 10 per cent jumped from 35 per cent to 59 per cent. Meanwhile the share of the bottom 50 per cent fell from 20 per cent to 13 per cent. This data is contested. Yet even if true, this would still imply an increase of 180 per cent in the real incomes per head of the bottom 50 per cent over the period. Moreover, by 2023, the average real incomes of the bottom 50 per cent were slightly above the all-India national average in 1991. The absolute number of people in extreme poverty and so the proportion, too, have collapsed. Fast growth is, as always, the most powerful way to eliminate poverty and improve opportunity.\n\nSingh\u2019s period as prime minister from 2004 to 2014 is more controversial than his period as finance minister. He was appointed by the leader of the Congress party, Sonia Gandhi. Indian democratic politics are deeply tainted by money. Yet he remained untainted. Moreover, as Pratap Bhanu Mehta argues, his achievements are underrated, partly because of the defeat by Narendra Modi\u2019s BJP in 2014. Yet they were substantial. They include the nuclear deal with the US, which ended the long-standing friction between the two countries. They also include the national rural employment guarantee scheme of 2005. Not least, in 2009 his government invited Nandan Nilekani of Infosys to launch India\u2019s unique identification system (Aadhaar), on which many of the BJP\u2019s reforms have been based.\n\nSingh was a global asset for India. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, a friend of mine since I joined the World Bank and a close associate of Singh in Indian policymaking, spoke recently about something former US president Barack Obama said of him in the G20 meetings: \u201cWhen the prime minister speaks, the world listens.\u201d\n\nSingh achieved what he did because he was a special man at a special time. Ultimately, however, technocrats only succeed if those with power trust them with it. India benefited from the fact that people with power were willing to trust him to use it well at critical moments. He, in turn, provided something that today\u2019s populists increasingly despise: knowledge, wisdom and experience. He also knew the importance of brilliant colleagues. A recent paper from the Mercatus Center describes him as \u201cIndia\u2019s finest talent scout\u201d. In some quarters today, all this would condemn him as an embodiment of the \u201cdeep state\u201d. That is because these people lack belief in the ideal of public service. Singh did believe in it. He believed, too, in a thriving democracy. Indeed, he thought India could not survive without one.\n\nThe economically dynamic India of today is his legacy. So, too, is his example of service to the cause of a prosperous India in harmony with the world.\n\nmartin.wolf@ft.com\n\nFollow Martin Wolf with\u00a0myFT and on\u00a0X\n\n\u200bLetters in response to this article:How corruption dogged Singh\u2019s second term as PM / From Pradeep S Mehta, Secretary General, Consumer Unity & Trust Society International, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India\n\n\u200bSingh showed reform was possible without autocracy\u00a0/\u00a0From Ismail Kenessy, Dakar, SenegalPraise for Indian taxpayer boondoggle is misplaced / From Nathan Punwani, Scottsdale, AZ, US\n\nSingh\u2019s record does not fit easy left-right pigeonholing\u00a0/\u00a0From Pritam Singh, Professor Emeritus, Oxford Brookes Business School, Oxford, UK", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/263ea342-b4cf-440c-9ebc-07f2a75ead60"}}, {"id": "b6c582f8-83ee-4538-8e39-4428407a9fb6", "event_name": "Indian investors rush into highly valued defence stocks", "blurb": "Asset managers have launched specialist funds as push for domestic armaments sends share prices soaring", "date": "2025-01-0700:00:00.0", "body": "Retail investors in India are pouring money into defence stocks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s push for domestic arms manufacturing drove the sector index up nearly 56 per cent in a year.\n\nAt least four large asset managers have launched sector-specific funds as experts forecast India\u2019s defence production will grow by as much as 20 per cent a year until the end of the decade.\n\nIndia shares a long, tense border with an increasingly assertive China, and with ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, there is strong demand for weaponry both at home and abroad.\n\nBut whereas New Delhi has been the world\u2019s largest arms importer for more than two decades, Modi is now pushing for the military to buy more weapons at home. He hopes that defence will help to turn India into a global manufacturing hub.\n\nThe drive for indigenisation has led to burgeoning order books at large local companies such as Hindustan Aeronautics, which produces fighters, helicopters and jet engines; Bharat Dynamics, which makes ammunition and missiles; and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, the country\u2019s largest naval shipyard.\n\nLong the domain of state-owned groups, which still account for 85 per cent of arms production, Modi has opened up the sector to private companies, including Adani Group, Larsen & Toubro and Tata Sons. The prime minister has set an annual target of nearly $35bn by the end of the decade for domestic defence production, from about $20bn currently.\n\nA Balasubramanian, chief executive of the asset manager Aditya Birla Sun Life \u2014 which launched a defence fund in August \u2014 said the \u201cvery large and growing order book\u201d at the top companies was a \u201cselling point\u201d for investors.\n\nBut he noted that state-owned companies still dominated the sector and the government maintained a shareholding of about 80 per cent in some of the largest companies.\n\n\u201cUnlike most other spaces that are truly open, this is not an entirely open space,\u201d Balasubramanian said.\n\nThe limited free float in the defence sector means there is a risk that stocks can be squeezed higher by relatively small amounts of investor buying.\n\nWith a market capitalisation of $31.9bn, Hindustan Aeronautics now trades at almost 10 times book value, on a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of 36 times. That implies investors must pay 36 rupees for one rupee of current profits.\n\nHDFC, one of the country\u2019s largest asset managers, was the first to launch a defence-focused fund in June 2023, and has given its investors an annualised return of nearly 73 per cent since then.\n\nThe fund generated so much interest that HDFC closed it for fresh investments this July, due to risks from the \u201ccurrent market valuation, volatility and the narrow universe\u201d, it said.\n\nThree more asset management groups have launched similar schemes after HDFC, tracking the only index for the sector managed by the National Stock Exchange. Motilal Oswal, a stockbroker and asset manager, promotes its fund by asking: \u201cIndia is investing in defence, are you?\u201d\n\nWith returns of nearly 56 per cent in 2024, the Nifty India Defence index has drastically outperformed the 10 per cent return on the wider Nifty 50 benchmark during the same period.\n\nIndia is slowly upgrading its ageing military hardware and desperately needs to buy new fighter jets, tanks, warships and artillery guns, as nearly two-thirds of its military equipment is classified as vintage.\n\nThe government allocated about $20bn for military modernisation for the fiscal year ending March 2025 \u2014 marginally up from $19bn last year \u2014 of which 75 per cent is earmarked for the domestic industry.\n\nA banker managing one defence fund said the total market cap of the sector was minimal 18 months ago, but since then, \u201cwe have seen a very sharp jump, not just in the valuation, but even the number of funds that are tracking\u201d.\n\nApart from the significant financial returns, retail buyers also latch on to an emotional, nationalistic motivation, even when the banks choose not to advertise it.

In the version that was published in 2020, data localisation was a mandatory condition but after significant lobbying by big tech, the act passed in 2023 merely created a black list of countries for data export. The new draft rules are open for public comment until February 18, and it will be interesting to see if large technology companies manage to push back once again.\n\nThe other significant area is on how minors can use social media. Users who are under 18 will need parental consent and companies must carry out due diligence to establish that the parent is indeed an adult. Yet the entire premise of this regulation hinges on children self-identifying themselves as minors, after which the onus is on technology companies to obtain \u201cverifiable consent\u201d from the parents, who will (presumably) have to upload some kind of government-approved identification to prove their credentials. Companies are prohibited from targeting advertisements at children or tracking their behaviour.\n\nThe government\u2019s intent is to protect children while preserving their access to information online, but the process suggested in the rules is severely flawed. Offenders are liable to strict penalties of up to Rs2bn, so perhaps the government\u2019s strategy is to leave it to technology companies to come up with a solution. However, even they are unlikely to be able to get an errant child to own up to their age online.\n\nDo you have any ideas on how this will work? Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nIndia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have declined to an eight-month low. This is largely due to the gradual but continuous depreciation in the value of the rupee, which has been falling to new lows every week in the last month. Overall, the rupee lost 3 per cent against the dollar in 2024. The Reserve Bank of India has sold dollars from its reserves to prop the rupee up. In December alone the reserves declined by $17.8bn, and now stand at $640.28bn.\n\nThe central bank has a difficult task at hand. It wants to manage the value of the rupee to avoid the economic shock from a sharp fall, and global conditions are not helping. US markets are rallying ahead of a Donald Trump presidency. In China, the government announced a slew of economic stimuli. These measures prompted global investors to sell their holdings of Indian equities and route that money to more lucrative markets abroad. I mentioned previously in India Business Briefing that in October and November, foreign investors sold $13.7bn of Indian equities.\n\nAnalysts expect the dollar to continue to strengthen in the weeks ahead, and most Asian currencies remain weak. A change in trajectory for the rupee is unlikely in the near term.\n\nChina\u2019s stock market has had a terrible start to the year.

Sure, there\u2019s a handsome stone portico and nicely restored window shutters, but nobody strolling south from the nearby Piazza del Popolo, with its remarkable twin domed basilicas, would have given number 246 a second glance.\n\nThey might now, at least if they were to peek inside.\n\nAfter a 12-year transformation by a Neapolitan multi-millionaire and the late Zaha Hadid, in what would be one of the Iraqi-British architect\u2019s last projects, the palazzo has been reborn as a 74-room luxury hotel. Just before Christmas, I am the first journalist to check in. I\u2019m stunned by what I find \u2014 and not always in a good way.\n\nThe Romeo Roma, which is due to open fully this month after years of delays, is the second hotel from Alfredo Romeo, a 71-year-old entrepreneur, newspaper proprietor, lawyer and property tycoon. His first hotel \u2014 Romeo Napoli \u2014 landed in his hometown in 2008, in a converted 1950s shipping company headquarters.\n\nBy then, Romeo had already set his sights on Rome and in 2012 he spotted the palazzo for sale. Originally developed in the 16th century by the Serroberti family of Perugian apothecaries, it then housed the Capponis until the death in 1746 of Alessandro Gregorio Capponi, a noble collector of literature.\n\nAfter an inheritance feud, the house was altered, rented and then sold off in 1818. It steadily lost its grandeur and most of its original features as it hosted residents as diverse as a deposed Portuguese king and the offices of the National Institute for Insurance Against Accidents at Work.\n\nThe location appealed to Romeo. The area around the Piazza del Popolo, at the northern end of Via del Corso, Rome\u2019s most famous shopping street, had become a high-end hub for the capital\u2019s fashion crowd. Hotels were already part of the draw, with the Palazzo Ripetta and the more famous Hotel de Russie just yards from Romeo\u2019s new doorstep.\n\nThe obvious solution for a neglected old palazzo would have been a restoration, perhaps with a hint of the contemporary. But Rome is not short of lodgings inspired by its rich lasagne of history. With an undisclosed budget that I suspect would have given Nero pause, Romeo was determined to look forwards.\n\nThe Italian says Hadid was intrigued when he first met her in 2014, two years before her sudden death, aged 65. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t created a hotel interior and I wanted her to think of an exclusive design that has never been done before,\u201d Romeo tells me via a translator. His elegant navy blazer and silk tie do not hint at his interest in the avant-garde.\n\nThe results of their brief and at times fraught partnership are startling. I\u2019m talking to Romeo in the hotel bar, which looks out on to a transformed courtyard. He says it\u2019s his favourite space, and it epitomises the wider approach. Which is to say, we are enveloped by extraordinary quantities of expensive, lustrous surfaces.\n\nEbony is the dominant material \u2014 tonnes of it. In many spaces, the ceilings, walls and floors are bedecked in macassar ebony veneer. Its black-and-brown grain flows in curves, ridges, spines and slashes, in a modernist, very Hadidist take on the forms of classical vaulted ceilings. Some of the craftsmanship is breathtaking.\n\nWhere there isn\u2019t ebony, there is enough polished white Carrara marble to have sunk Caligula\u2019s giant barge. In a recurring motif, raised sculptural fireplaces burst out of the walls like huge slashed blisters. Inlaid seams of stainless steel flow along floors and leap up walls. Draped folds of brass shingles shimmer behind twin reception desks, which look as if they have been pulled up from the ground in great basalt fists.\n\nOf the building\u2019s original features, only a marble staircase and a clutch of rooms on the piano nobile had survived intact. There are now five \u201cfresco suites\u201d. In one, a staircase in Krion, a kind of matte porcelain that has also been used extensively, curves around an enormous sculptural bath tub to a space-age mezzanine bedroom. The bed sits right under centuries-old frescoes and an ornate ceiling. It\u2019s a dizzying juxtaposition.\n\nRomeo Roma is nothing if not original, and anyone who cocks a snook at the corporate safe-playing of much of the luxury hotel market is to be admired. But it\u2019s also, well, a lot. I\u2019m told the wood\u2019s marine topcoat was applied to protect Romeo\u2019s investment (he nods when I ask him if his ebony bill alone would have been enough to build a very nice hotel). But the high gloss adds to the overall, slightly claustrophobic feeling of entering a sheikh\u2019s superyacht.\n\nThose sculptural fireplaces are all fake, meanwhile, and have been equipped with remote controlled fake fires with fake logs and a tinny, crackling sound effect. They seem irredeemably naff. But when I diplomatically ask Romeo if he is happy with the way form and fake fire sit together, he says the question hadn\u2019t occurred to him.\n\nRomeo collects benches, and some are comically incongruous (I\u2019m thinking in particular of a bright red metal number in the courtyard that is shaped as a musical stave next to a giant guitar). Then there are the water features. In the palazzo\u2019s now covered original courtyard, where carriages would have disgorged nobles, Romeo has installed a computer-controlled water curtain against the principal wall. A row of dozens of nozzles creates a noisy kind of water screen, lit up with coloured lights, that fleetingly displays the words \u201cRomeo\u201d and \u201cWelcome\u201d as the water falls. It would be a bit much at a Disney resort in Dubai, never mind in the middle of Rome.\n\nBehind the palazzo, a larger new courtyard is bordered by a more recent wing housing a spa and most of the rooms. It includes a remarkable Hadid staircase that rises to a drinks terrace like the rib cage of some cubist whale. But there\u2019s also more rainbow-lit water, flowing from a marble fountain, and down the walls beside a fresco of the Virgin Mary.\n\nRomeo freely admits that, while he admired Hadid greatly, their thinking often diverged. The ebony was his idea, and so were the fireplaces. \u201cIt was mainly the materials we argued about,\u201d he says. \u201cTo her, it was unthinkable that anyone would spend so much to create such structures.\u201d\n\nPerhaps such differing views contributed to the delays; Romeo had hoped to open in 2016. He says it had more to do with a Roman ruin discovered under the modern wing and new courtyard. For almost five years, archaeologists excavated a suspected taverna, along with crates of artefacts. A small bust of Livia Drusilla, wife of Emperor Augustus, now surveys the old courtyard. A swimming pool in the new courtyard incorporates a glass floor above the ruin.\n\nFor all its quixotic vigour, the Romeo triumphs in many areas. Alain Ducasse has done amazing things in the main restaurant, only his second in Italy (the first opened in Romeo Napoli last June). A tasting menu executed by the French food wizard\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and head chef St\u00e9phane Petit, who is 29, is a much defter marriage of old and new, as well as Italian and French (charred puntarelle with anchovy and a delicate pot-au-feu stand out).\n\nThe dining room itself, which looks out on to Via di Ripetta and is mostly clad in ebony, is also remarkable. Square columns flow into vaulted canopies that are backlit through long, slashed perforations. Marble walls and a gleaming open steel kitchen bring more light to the space.\n\nParts of the Sisley spa are also spectacular, including a relaxation room clad in bricks of pink Italian rock salt, and a gym in shaped wood that benefits from having escaped the high-gloss treatment. Lacquered ebony dominates my bedroom, meanwhile, which is nonetheless a masterpiece of modernist cabinetry \u2014 fake fireplace and all.\n\nWhatever one thinks of his vision, Romeo was wise to recruit two creative heavyweights to bring it to life; a rash of openings at the top end of the market in the past five years has included a Six Senses, the Rome Edition, a W, and the Bulgari Hotel, which occupies the hulking 1930s former headquarters of the Italian social security agency (I\u2019ll have your most ironic cocktail).\n\nThey are all modern spaces competing for the same international market, yet none can claim a Hadid or a Ducasse in its marketing. That the Romeo thinks it has an edge is clear in its prices. They start at \u20ac2,450 per night for the smallest digs (rising to \u20ac37,000 for the largest), which is a chunk higher than any of the above properties.\n\nPerhaps Romeo, who plans to open his third hotel on the Amalfi coast later this year, is also trying to claw back some of the money he has poured into the place. At one point, he whispers the total bill, before later asking me not to share it. Let\u2019s just say that, on a per room basis, I suspect you would struggle to find a costlier hotel.\n\n\u201cIt seems unsustainable from a financial point of view,\u201d Romeo tells me with half a smile, before supervising the repositioning of a new sofa near his digital water curtain. \u201cBut beauty is always an investment.\u201d\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and sign up to receive the FT Weekend newsletter every Saturday morning\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nA hotel so appealing it\u2019s hard to tear yourself away / From Michael Webb, Architectural Writer, Los Angeles, CA, US", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0ed6d781-8d51-4df1-b6bb-2d24144a7575"}}, {"id": "2756b508-c23b-4155-9079-6f17ab82ecd7", "event_name": "India\u2019s next digital payments boom", "blurb": "Also in this newsletter: Is India\u2019s stock market run waning and some New Year\u2019s Eve party stats  ", "date": "2025-01-0300:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning and happy new year. In a move that will significantly widen and deepen the digital payments ecosystem, WhatsApp will now be allowed to roll out its payment service to all users. In today\u2019s newsletter, I also look at whether India\u2019s two-year stock market run is coming to an end. In cricket, the fifth test match of the Border-Gavaskar series started in Sydney today, and your social media feeds are probably already full of Rohit Sharma drama. But first, what\u2019s up on WhatsApp?\n\nIndia\u2019s robust digital payments infrastructure is set to explode now that WhatsApp is being given a free run by the country\u2019s digital payments regulator, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). Until Tuesday, the popular messaging service had not been allowed to offer its payment service beyond a fraction of its users (100mn). With this restriction now lifted, WhatsApp can proceed to roll out the service to its full base, estimated at more than 500mn users. This move will widen the base of transacting accounts for the Unified Payments Interface \u2014 the technology that enables digital payment transactions in India \u2014 and increase its depth.\n\nOn Tuesday, the NPCI (which was clearly busy at work on the last day of 2024) also extended the deadline to comply with a market share cap that restricts digital payment firms from accounting for more than 30 per cent of the volume of transactions processed through the UPI. Firms now have two more years to meet this requirement, good news for Walmart-backed PhonePe and Google Pay, which have 47.8 per cent and 37 per cent of all UPI transactions respectively. Both of these companies would have had to clip back their service after Tuesday had this extension not come through.\n\nClearly, the governing body\u2019s intent is to build on the early success of UPI and significantly expand the market. There is no doubt that the pervasiveness of digital payments, their ease of use and widespread acceptance, has helped transform our everyday financial lives. However, fraud remains a concern. Rolling out payments to all WhatsApp users leaves a large chunk of people who are financially or technologically inept vulnerable to scams.\n\nOther than running vague advertisements that put the onus of caution on users, WhatsApp parent Meta has done little to educate users about safe in-app digital payments. I have myself been surprised by how quickly WhatsApp pay options pop up on my screen every time I click on a QR code from my image gallery, despite the fact that I have neither signed up nor used the service. Frictionless transactions will also enable fraud in the blink of an eye. While opening up the market, it is imperative that the regulator imposes strict guidelines on WhatsApp to minimise fraud, educate users, and insure them against dubious transactions.\n\nAm I being overcautious? Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com or hit reply.\n\nIs the two-year bull run in the Indian stock market coming to an end? Foreign portfolio investors sold a record $11.2bn of Indian stocks in October and a further $2.5bn in November. There were both push and pull factors at play here. In September 2024, China announced a series of stimulus measures, which led to investors liquidating their India positions to invest in Shanghai. On the push side, slowing consumption and GDP growth in India are real concerns in the economy. These, added to the high valuation that stocks were at, made Indian stocks a difficult buy.\n\nDecember was a slightly different story though. Foreign investors were net buyers during the month, even if the amount\u00a0was relatively modest, at $1.97bn. And there was even more heartening news this week when auto sales numbers were published. Maruti Suzuki reported a 30 per cent increase in total sales compared with November and Mahindra & Mahindra sold 16 per cent more vehicles. Hyundai Motor reported a dip of 2.4 per cent in December sales, but the company achieved its highest-ever annual sales in the year. Are these signs of green shoots? It\u2019s too early to tell. But in times like these, perhaps we should celebrate these small wins \u2014 and keep our fingers firmly crossed.\n\nBullish or bearish \u2014 what is your view on the Indian stock market for 2025?

Quick commerce companies posted some interesting facts about what people ordered on December 31. Here are some highlights.\n\nDo you have any new year resolutions? An interesting survey I saw on Statista suggested that in the US, the top trending resolution for 2025 is to save more money (21 per cent). This was followed by the usual suspects \u2014 to eat more healthily (19 per cent), to exercise more (17 per cent)\u00a0 and to lose weight (15 per cent). Some 9 per cent want to quit smoking, but an equal number want to reduce their spending on living expenses such as food and energy costs (how?!). And the biggest chunk of people? They have no resolutions at all (43 per cent).\n\nI don\u2019t often make resolutions myself, although I give myself some goals to chase. I have two for this year \u2014 reduce my screen time as reported by my iPhone every Sunday and take the metro to work (instead of driving) at least three times a week.

A further $2.5bn was offloaded in November.\n\nAnalysts say that \u201cpull\u201d factors were at play, with China\u2019s recent stimulus measures luring back some foreign investors. Many foreign investors had also struggled to buy into the India fervour because of lofty stock valuations.\n\n\u201cThere is a wide acknowledgment that there is a slowdown,\u201d said Aditya Suresh, head of India equity research at Macquarie Capital. \u201cWhat people are grappling with is [the] duration: how long?\u201d\n\nInternational markets had cheered India\u2019s economic resurgence since the Covid-19 pandemic, with Franklin Templeton in 2023 anointing the world\u2019s most populous country the \u201cnext China\u201d. Morgan Stanley foretold \u201cIndia\u2019s decade\u201d, pointing to an \u201ceconomic boom\u201d led by offshoring, manufacturing, green energy and advanced digital infrastructure.\n\nIndian companies rushed to sell shares, buoyed by domestic investors ploughing savings into exuberant public markets, while the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy joined benchmark bond indices in 2024.\n\nBut India has begun to lose some of its momentum. GDP growth in the quarter ended September came in at just 5.4 per cent year on year, the lowest rate in nearly two years. The Reserve Bank of India in November cut its growth forecast for the 2024-25 financial year from 7.2 per cent to 6.6 per cent.\n\nCore industries such as mining, manufacturing \u2014 the focus of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s flagship \u201cMade in India\u201d push \u2014 and construction also sagged in the quarter.\n\nGross value added growth, which measures actual production value, for manufacturing dropped to 2.15 per cent, from 14.3 per cent rate in the September quarter last year. Construction sector GVA also slowed.\n\nMacquarie analysts pointed to a series of factors behind India\u2019s slowdown, including weaker government spending during an election year, following a yearlong infrastructure drive, and severe monsoon rains that disrupted economic activity.\n\nThey also noted that Indian households were increasingly struggling as wage growth has failed to keep pace with high inflation, while a central bank crackdown on unsecured loans and retail credit has weakened spending, forcing many families to dip into savings already depleted by the pandemic.\n\nIn October, headline inflation accelerated to more than 6 per cent, above the RBI\u2019s target band of 4 to 6 per cent. Despite moderating in November to 5.5 per cent, the RBI has continued to hold its key lending rate at 6.5 per cent since early 2023 \u2014 drawing outcry from ministers in New Delhi, who say high borrowing costs are hurting businesses.\n\nIndia\u2019s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in December that the drop in economic growth was a \u201ctemporary blip\u201d. But many economists believe the slowdown is not just seasonal, pointing to a drop in spending among overleveraged urban and middle-class Indians.\n\nSales growth for fast-moving consumer goods slowed to just 2.8 per cent in the September quarter, from 11 per cent in the same period last year, according to NielsenIQ. Largely poorer rural areas are now outpacing urban growth rates.\n\nThe RBI has also voiced repeated concerns over the past year on the rapid growth in consumer loans and credit card debt, and demanded lenders allocate more capital against their exposure to rein in bank borrowing.\n\n\u201cThere is a moderation in income, there is a moderation in credit availability,\u201d said Sonal Varma, a Singapore-based economist at Nomura.\n\n\u201cUrban consumption is important because if it doesn\u2019t pick up and exports are weak, then capacity utilisation is not going to move up\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[and] the private investment cycle that everybody has been hoping to take off for many years now will not be able to by next year.\u201d\n\nMacquarie\u2019s Suresh said the cumulative impact of a more than 35 per cent rise of food and beverage inflation since 2020 has also eroded spending power among hundreds of millions of India\u2019s poor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a quick fix here for this,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if there was a shot in the arm, it\u2019s a sugar rush rather than a lasting solution. The duration\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009may not be as straightforward as one quarter or two.\u201d\n\nSluggish investment by Indian companies, which reported a weak set of earnings in the third quarter, is another factor, impeding the creation of much-needed formal jobs, economists said.\n\n\u201cSince investments have been very low for a fairly long time, the economy has not generated enough jobs of the good kind that lead to a bump in consumer spending,\u201d said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.\n\nCorporate investments\u2019 share of GDP has declined in recent years, dropping from about 25 per cent in the 2008 fiscal year to about 13-14 per cent since the 2020 fiscal year, according to analysis from financial group Motilal Oswal.\n\nNomura\u2019s Varma believes demand has not picked up to a level to \u201ctrigger new capacity expansion\u201d and that cheap imports from neighbouring rival China have provided a disincentive for Indian corporates from investing to expand domestic output.\n\nGoing into 2025, many economists expect an easing of monetary policy as a new RBI governor takes the helm, as well as an increase in government spending.\n\nNevertheless, \u201cmomentum is going to be softer\u201d, said Varma. \u201cWe think this is going to last for at least another six months.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b667ccd3-b066-4308-8d6f-8ee0a08f635e"}}, {"id": "65e0423b-bd99-47a2-99e9-48d3037ef6ec", "event_name": "Three dates in 2025 that\u2019ll set the tone for India", "blurb": "Also in this newsletter: health insurers\u2019 claims record, and how Rishad Premji stays sharp  ", "date": "2024-12-3100:00:00.0", "body": "Good morning. On the last day of the year, it is tempting to gaze into the future and make big predictions. But I\u2019ll resist adding to the slew of \u201coutlook 2025\u201d reports out there (some FT favourites: what investors need to look out for; FT Alphaville fed ChatGPT some investment outlook reports; and what to read in 2025). Instead, let\u2019s take a look at three big dates in the first quarter of the coming year that will have a significant impact on our businesses and economy.\u00a0Mark your calendars!\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s inauguration day, and perhaps this time the headlines will not be about the size of the crowd. For India, the big issue at this stage is Trump\u2019s threats to impose reciprocal tariffs. The US is India\u2019s biggest trading partner, accounting for $77.5bn worth of goods and 18 per cent of total exports. Without knowing the specifics of what Trump plans to do (this will probably be a common tune for the next four years), it is difficult to predict how exactly it will impact the Indian economy.\u00a0Analysts predict the damage to be anything between 0.3 and 0.8 per cent of GDP. The government is trying to stay one step ahead, with officials running sector by sector analyses and drawing up negotiation strategies to minimise the damage to the economy.\n\nFor Indians, the other main area of concern will be the H-1B visas the US issues for foreign workers in \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d. As of 2023, nearly 73 per cent of H-1B visa holders were Indians. Since the programme is tilted towards technology and software jobs, providing onshore IT professionals has been a reliable business model for software companies as well as a robust career path for Indian software professionals. But battle lines over the number of Indians in the US with H-1B visas have already been drawn. While Trump\u2019s adviser, \u201cFirst Buddy\u201d Elon Musk, sees it as a critical route to recruit talented engineers, the president-elect\u2019s Maga base has hit out at what it sees as more jobs going to immigrants. Trump has backed Musk \u2014 but for how long?\n\nMuch like an Indian Premier League match or a Diwali blockbuster, excitement about the Union Budget is a uniquely Indian thing and we are here for it. With lower than expected GDP growth and higher than anticipated inflation, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has her task cut out for her. Preparations are in full swing. Last week, the prime minister met economists and policy experts at Niti Aayog (formerly the Planning Commission) to thrash out strategies for the Budget, and Sitharaman chaired the fourth pre-Budget consultation with experts from various industry sectors.\n\nFebruary\u2019s Budget will set the tone for Narendra Modi\u2019s third term as prime minister, and it will be interesting to see what the government prioritises. I\u2019m betting on three central areas: one, sectors that will generate employment, including those that require a large number of gig workers; two, expansion of the government\u2019s capital expenditure plans in order to restart growth momentum; and three, some tax sops for the middle class, whose grumbles about paying money and not getting much in return have only grown louder in recent years.\n\nThe challenge of balancing the books continues to be tricky, with an ever-widening current account deficit. On social media, Sitharaman gets a lot of criticism for her stern expression and straight talk. But who can blame her? Her job sounds like it will rob anyone of all joy.\n\nNewly appointed Reserve Bank of India governor, Sanjay Malhotra, will announce his first decision on interest rates. The government wants the central bank to cut rates to jump-start growth. Last week, a finance ministry report directly attributed the recent slowdown in demand to the RBI\u2019s monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. This lends credibility to the whispers early in the month that former governor Shaktikanta Das was denied an extension of his term because of his reluctance to cut rates, but let\u2019s not get bogged down by arguments of correlation and causality now.\n\nThe RBI\u2019s December meeting was the 11th consecutive time the central bank decided to hold rates in order to battle soaring inflation. It is reasonable to expect that Malhotra will want to keep the finance ministry happy; who among us has not strategised to establish early success in a new job? But the question is whether the inflation gods will be kind to him. To my mind, it is unlikely that there will be a sharp drop in the headline number. Further, global uncertainties are only worsening, and who knows what a fortnight of Trump\u2019s America will unleash. These conditions are not ideal for a rate cut, but as my last act of bravado for 2024, I\u2019m going to stick my neck out and say there will be one. (Will I crow about this or eat crow?

It also exports to more than 30 countries.\n\nThe divestment comes as Indian food companies have struggled with weak demand among hundreds of millions of poor and middle-class households, who have been hit by heightened inflation and scaled back their spending.\n\nAdani Wilmar\u2019s operating income fell 41 per cent in the last financial year to about $90mn after it was hit by declining food oil prices and losses at its Bangladesh subsidiary, although its latest quarterly earnings have since shown a recovery, according to Indian credit rating agency Care Ratings.\n\nBut the company\u2019s stock has also fallen 12 per cent this year, compared with the 8.8 per cent gain of India\u2019s blue-chip Nifty 50 index.\n\nNeither Adani nor Wilmar referenced the US charges in their statements on the decision.\n\nThe Adani Group has denied any wrongdoing in response to the US allegations, while Gautam Adani said \u201cevery attack makes us stronger\u201d after the indictment.\n\nAdani Group\u2019s international ventures have come under increased scrutiny since the US indictment, with Kenya\u2019s President William Ruto cancelling $2.6bn in proposed deals and Bangladesh probing a cross-border electricity deal.\n\nThis article has been changed since publication to give a correct figure for Adani Wilmar\u2019s operating income.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7a3edf8a-f8ea-46f7-8264-c023f8f9158f"}}, {"id": "d56d6e40-5f46-461a-a728-ab11f231372a", "event_name": "What the \u2018year of democracy\u2019 taught us, in 6 charts", "blurb": "The billions who voted in 2024 sent an angry message to incumbents, and warmed to populists on left and right", "date": "2024-12-3000:00:00.0", "body": "It was heralded as the year of democracy. With more than one and a half billion ballots cast in elections across 73 countries, 2024 offered a rare opportunity to take the social and political temperature of almost half of the world\u2019s population.\n\nThe results are now in, and they have delivered a damning verdict on holders of public office.\n\nThe incumbent in every one of the 12 developed western countries that held national elections in 2024 lost vote share at the polls, the first time this has ever happened in almost 120 years of modern democracy. In Asia, even the hegemonic governments of India and Japan were not spared the ill wind.\n\nIncumbent or otherwise, centrists were frequently the losers as voters threw in their lot behind radical parties of either flank. The populist right in particular surged forward, fuelled in significant part by a rightward shift among young men.\n\nThe results paint a picture of angry electorates stung by record inflation, fed up with economic stagnation, disquieted by rising immigration, and increasingly disillusioned with the system as a whole.\n\nIn a sense, the year of democracy produced a cry that democracy is no longer working, with the younger generation, many voting for the first time, delivering some of the strongest rebukes against the establishment.\n\nOn average across the developed world, incumbents\u2019 vote share fell by seven percentage points in 2024, an all-time record and more than double the decline as electorates punished elected officials in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\n\nThe range of countries producing similar results points to a common undercurrent, with inflation the obvious culprit.\n\nComing into 2024, high and rising prices were the public\u2019s top concern in the vast majority of the countries going to the polls. While recessions are deeply unpopular, their impacts are unevenly distributed. Inflation stings everyone.\n\nBut if the cost of living crisis acted as a handicap on incumbents, a closer look across different countries and regions shows that it was far from the only driver of discontent.\n\nThe biggest backlash against a sitting government came in Britain, where the Conservatives\u2019 charge sheet included not only high prices but a corruption scandal, a crisis in public healthcare provision, a self-inflicted economic shock and a sharp spike in immigration.\n\nAcross the channel in France, president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s attempt to fend off the populist right by calling snap legislative elections backfired. The resulting political chaos is yet to be fully resolved months later.\n\nIn India, Narendra Modi\u2019s formidable Bharatiya Janata party machine secured a narrow victory but lost its parliamentary majority, struggling to hold back the tide of dissatisfaction over the increasing disconnect between strong economic growth and weak job creation.\n\nThis was particularly pronounced among young people, whose unemployment rate climbed to almost 50 per cent ahead of the election, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.\n\nEven the exceptions to the anti-incumbent wave are less anomalous when considered in the context of other central themes of the year\u2019s political shifts.\n\nIn Mexico and Indonesia respectively, Claudia Sheinbaum and Prabowo Subianto each improved upon the margin of the sitting president. In both cases, they ran broad campaigns pledging continuity with their anti-elitist predecessors, illustrating the near-universal success of populists over the past twelve months. Prabowo also leaned heavily on dominance of the new social media landscape, another common theme.\n\nViewed across the world as a whole, the weak performance of centrist parties and the march of populists, particularly on the right, was just as strong a theme as the anti-incumbent wave, perhaps stronger.\n\nEven the Labour party\u2019s victory in Britain is no exception here, as it won this year with fewer votes than in either of the two previous elections it lost. And just months after a landslide victory, opinion has turned sharply against both party and leader.\n\nThe French public\u2019s souring on Macron and his centrist party, meanwhile, reflects the wider global mood of disillusionment with the political establishment, and the sense that elected officials either don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care what ordinary people think.\n\nAlthough ultimately falling narrowly short of its hoped-for victory, the 15-point swing achieved by France\u2019s Rassemblement National in parliamentary elections was the largest recorded by any party in any developed country this year. The second, third and fourth-biggest gains of the year were all by fellow rightwing populists in the form of Austria\u2019s Freedom party, Britain\u2019s Reform UK and Portugal\u2019s Chega.\n\nThis speaks to the fact that immigration has been a rising concern across the developed world in recent years, and was one of the key issues on voters\u2019 minds as they went to the polls.\n\nWhere conservative parties lost ground, it was generally parties outflanking them on the right who were the main beneficiaries. The success of Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK in peeling off Conservative voters in Britain has been widely attributed to the latter\u2019s failure to meet its promise to reduce immigration numbers.\n\nBut anti-establishment successes were not limited to the right. The Greens in the UK were one of a smattering of radical leftwing parties that also gained ground as voters disillusioned with a stale centre broke in both directions.\n\nWhile the timing and magnitude of the anti-incumbent wave point primarily to the short-term shock of higher prices, the populist surge looks more like the continuation \u2014 or perhaps acceleration \u2014 of a trend that has been playing out in a growing number of countries over two decades at least.\n\nOne prominent theory for why we\u2019re seeing this unfold was laid out in an influential paper published earlier this year by a team of Harvard economists, who found that people who grow up against a backdrop of weaker economic growth and less progress between generations are more likely to view the world as zero sum, where one person\u2019s gain must come at someone else\u2019s cost.\n\nThe steady decrease in upward economic mobility in rich countries could thus explain much of the rise in these views, which tend to be associated with support for parties and politicians on both left and right that promise to tear up the existing system or to protect against external threats.\n\nOne further possibility is that the dramatic changes to the media landscape over the past two decades have played a part in eroding previously long-standing norms against populist rhetoric and talking points. The emergence of social media has made it easier for political outsiders to speak directly to the public, levelling a playing field that had previously tilted towards established figures and parties.\n\nBeneath the surface of the headline results, one of the most striking patterns seen in country after country has been the rise in support for the populist right among young men.\n\nIn Britain, support for Reform is now higher among men in their late teens and early twenties than among those in their thirties, and a marked gender gap has opened up among the youngest voters. A very similar pattern can be seen in the US, where young men also swung sharply towards Donald Trump in November, and the same pattern appears across much of Europe.\n\nNotably, there appears to be plenty of room for this trend to continue: the share saying they would consider voting for the radical right is even higher than those who already have.\n\nSuch a pronounced shift is startling, but is not without plausible explanation. If discontent with economic stagnation drives zero-sum attitudes, few groups have experienced such a flatlining as young men, whose relative socio-economic status has been in steady decline across the west.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only young men moving to the extremes. Young women in the US also swung towards Trump, while in the UK they shifted heavily to the Greens.\n\nThis fits with research from the polling company FocalData earlier this year, which found young people far more likely than their elders to support a hypothetical national populist party, and a 2020 study which found satisfaction with democracy in the developed west plummeting further and faster among young adults than any other group.\n\nAll indications are that both defining trends of 2024 are set to continue next year. The latest polls show the incumbent governments of Australia, Canada, Germany and Norway all on course to lose power in the coming months.\n\nAnd in most of these countries it is once again the populist right that looks set to make the biggest gains. Norway\u2019s rightwing populist Progress party currently leads after finishing fourth in 2021, and Germany\u2019s AfD are currently polling in second place.\n\nThe acute inflation crisis may have passed, but with stubbornly weak economic growth, a widening generational wealth gap and a fragmented media, 2024 may prove to be less an anomaly than one particularly jagged point on a downward trend.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/350ba985-bb07-4aa3-aa5e-38eda7c525dd"}}, {"id": "8d00ee64-909d-41b2-8ead-399d77c6337b", "event_name": "India is overlooking the climate drag on its economic growth", "blurb": "The country\u2019s climate-neutral GDP forecasts require urgent revision", "date": "2024-12-2900:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is the founder and chief executive of AlphaGeo and author of \u2018The Future is Asian\u2019\n\nThe November COP29 summit ended predictably: a last-minute, watered-down commitment to support developing countries in their urgent climate adaptation efforts was delivered. India\u2019s delegate then led the equally predictable outcry with a fiery diatribe against the paltry sums promised. India is right to worry: it is facing a combustible mix of climate volatility and demographic vulnerability from being an overpopulated poor country.\n\nThere is a widespread consensus that India will be the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy for the next decade and perhaps beyond. The World Bank recently upped its growth forecast for the country from 6.6 per cent to 7 per cent in the fiscal year to next March 31. Yet India still faces major economic headwinds such as slow structural reforms, trade barriers, too heavy banking sector regulation and high youth unemployment.\n\nAnd almost entirely ignored in the heady growth forecasts is the role of climate change. This is in spite of environmental shifts beginning to bite into India\u2019s corporate sector. Leading food delivery app Zomato cited heat stress in explaining its lower-than-expected Q1 earnings, and infrastructure giant Larsen & Toubro is shifting working hours to adapt to searing heat. Ironically, during the COP summit, India\u2019s air pollution reached record levels, with schools closed and flights grounded.\n\nAsia as a whole \u2014 and south Asia in particular \u2014 is bearing the brunt of global climate volatility. Asia now accounts for more than half of global greenhouse gas emissions, which have in turn led to record-breaking heatwaves, droughts, floods, hurricanes and rising sea levels. More than 80 per cent of India\u2019s people live in districts that are at risk of climate-induced disasters, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn October, the Asian Development Bank warned that climate change could hit India\u2019s GDP by as much as 25 per cent by 2070. This is not unrealistic: a third of India\u2019s GDP is linked to nature-related sectors. Increasingly frequent droughts are threatening agricultural output, a \u201cday zero\u201d water event, in which all water sources dry up, has already hit Chennai and heatwaves are stressing the electricity grid. India\u2019s most recent official Economic Survey claims that the country is spending more than 5 per cent of GDP on climate adaptation.\n\nIt is also important to note that one of India\u2019s most significant exports is people. Climate stress will only accelerate the brain drain to countries with a more temperate climate and labour shortages.\u00a0That will in turn have an economic impact.\n\nIt is clear that climate-neutral growth forecasts for India need a systematic correction. The nascent field of climate econometrics is making welcome progress on this more generally. Swiss Re has issued dire warnings about the aggregate hit to global GDP from increasing climate stress. S&P considers climate hazards \u2014 sea level rise, extreme heat, flooding \u2014 to calculate GDP at risk and the ability of countries to avoid and respond to some of these losses based on their economic and institutional strength.\n\nBut the impact of climate change on India\u2019s growth prospects also needs to be looked at more from the bottom up. At AlphaGeo, we have calculated a revised GDP outlook for each state, considering factors such as population density, the sectoral composition of its economy, climate hazard exposure and a composite of metrics such as the reliability of energy grids and flood control measures.\n\nWe estimate that India\u2019s GDP will rise up from $3.97tn today to $7.75tn by 2030. This represents a climate correction of about $500bn from the Ministry of Finance\u2019s projections for state-level growth that suggest an aggregated trajectory to $8.26tn at the end of the decade \u2014 a substantial penalty for a developing country, to say nothing of the human toll it represents.\n\nIndia needs climate econometrics that capture more granular data on the real-time impact of natural disasters on supply chains and commercial activity. This is possible by methods such as collecting satellite imagery of night-time lights and real-time commercial transaction data. But even a perfect digital twin of the economy is less useful than pragmatic measures such as flood controls, water desalination and communal cooling centres that ensure population health and infrastructural resilience.\n\nLiving up to India\u2019s dreams of superpower status will require nothing less. India may yet remain the fastest-growing large economy, but this will only remain the case if climate adaptation becomes a strategic priority for the government, corporates and investors.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/927a4c8b-db4c-4a46-af68-71c5a03452ab"}}, {"id": "1b21e48b-cc42-41ea-9d4b-fa240dd0f8db", "event_name": "Manmohan Singh, former Indian prime minister, 1932-2024  ", "blurb": "As finance minister, he paved the way for a transformative liberalisation of the state-controlled economy", "date": "2024-12-2600:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who died aged 92 on Thursday, launched a transformative liberalisation of the state-controlled economy during a 1991 currency crisis, putting the country on a long-term trajectory of faster growth and rising global influence.\n\nAs finance minister from 1991 until 1996, Singh overcame entrenched political resistance to end decades of isolation and stagnation, open India\u2019s doors to greater foreign trade and private investment, and begin its integration into the global economy.\n\nThe Oxford-trained economist, known for his mild, self-effacing manner and personal integrity, was subsequently tapped by Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born Congress party leader, to serve as premier after the party\u2019s shock electoral victory in 2004.\n\nSingh was considered by Gandhi a safe, technocratic choice to lead India, who would not emerge as a political rival to her or her young son, Rahul, whom she was grooming to eventually take over the party leadership.\n\nDuring his premiership, Singh\u2019s hope of continuing India\u2019s economic reforms was thwarted by Congress\u2019s coalition partners, which objected to many of the measures he wished to pursue.\n\nHis second term in office from 2009 was seen as opportunity to press ahead with more dramatic reforms. But he ended up weak and isolated within his party as high-profile corruption scandals plagued his administration.\n\nBorn in 1932 in a rural village in what is today part of Pakistan, Singh, a member of the Sikh faith, migrated to India when British-ruled India was divided into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.\n\nHe attended university in India, then obtained a degree from Cambridge and a PhD in economics from Oxford, writing a thesis and book entitled \u201cIndia\u2019s Export Trends and Prospects for Sustained Growth\u201d.\n\nIt challenged India\u2019s then pervasive export pessimism that was to blight its development for a further three decades. Singh subsequently worked for several years at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n\nIn 1969, he returned to India to teach economics. Then in 1971, Singh took up a post as economic adviser in the commerce ministry, the start of a long career in government service in which he held many top posts, including governor of the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nBut his fundamental role in transforming India came in 1991, as it was facing a severe foreign exchange crisis, which had forced the country to fly some of its gold reserves abroad as security for an IMF rescue loan.\n\nSingh seized the opportunity to break with the antitrade world view that had dominated India post-independence, and begin the process of opening up the country\u2019s tightly controlled, socialist-oriented economy to greater private and foreign investment, bringing an end to an era of chronically low growth.\n\nHis steps, alongside prime minister PV Narasimha Rao, to dismantle the so-called \u201cLicence Raj\u201d of strict economic controls during his five-year tenure as finance minister laid the foundation for a rapid acceleration of India\u2019s economic growth, hitting highs of nearly 9 per cent, up from an average of around 2 to 3 per cent.\n\nIn his first term as prime minister from 2004, Singh created debt relief and job creation schemes for farmers, and sought to establish social welfare programmes to assist those yet to benefit from India\u2019s accelerated growth.\n\nHe also tried to bring more transparency to government by implementing a freedom of information law, similar to those in the west.\n\nBut the most significant achievement was his transformation of New Delhi\u2019s relationship with Washington, which had imposed sanctions on India for its nuclear tests a decade earlier.\n\nIn 2008, he staked his political future on a quest to obtain parliamentary approval for a major civil nuclear agreement with the US, in spite of opposition from leftist former coalition partners and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party.\n\nThe successful parliamentary vote buried the legacy of cold war animosity between the two countries despite India\u2019s refusal to relinquish its nuclear weapons programme, while sealing Singh\u2019s unlikely friendship with the then-US president George W Bush.\n\nLater that year, after Pakistan-based militants launched a seaborne terror strike on Mumbai, killing 170 people, Singh showed considerable restraint by resisting calls for harsh retaliation, thus averting a potential regional conflagration.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, many of Singh\u2019s advisers said he should have handed the premiership over to a younger leader after the election victory of 2009.\n\nHis second term was one of bitter disappointment and paralysis, marred by corruption scandals, unruly allies and an economy retreating from double-digit economic growth amid stubbornly high inflation.\n\nHowever, during this time, he did empower Nandan Nilekani, cofounder of tech giant Infosys, to lead a team that built an advanced biometric identification system known as Aadhaar, which gradually led to vast improvements in the delivery of welfare payments for millions of poorer Indians.\n\nStill, public disillusionment with Singh\u2019s seeming inaction as economic and political conditions deteriorated paved the way for the 2014 election of the BJP leader Narendra Modi, who promised muscular leadership, faster job creation and accelerated growth.\n\nSingh kept a low profile after retirement, though he did make occasional public criticisms of his successor\u2019s performance. In 2019 he accused Modi of creating a \u201ctoxic\u201d environment and \u201cclimate of fear\u201d that had led to a sharp economic slowdown by undermining business confidence.\n\nDuring his final months as premier, back in 2014, Singh predicted that \u201chistory will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter opposition parties\u201d.\n\nLetter in response to this obituary:\n\nWhen Manmohan Singh left me lost for words / From Richard Lambert, former FT Editor", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0eeb0d5e-3e6b-4f00-ba26-f7b0ac51de2c"}}, {"id": "4cdafc8b-f2b1-422d-82f6-d07d4ecc9e39", "event_name": "India\u2019s former prime minister Manmohan Singh dies", "blurb": "Oxford-educated economist liberalised the country\u2019s economy and paved the way for strong growth", "date": "2024-12-2600:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who liberalised the economy and then led the country through a period of strong economic growth, has died.\n\nSingh, 92, was being treated for age-related medical conditions, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi said, as it announced his death on Thursday.\n\nThe Oxford university-educated economist set India on a path to becoming a fast-growing economy as finance minister from 1991 to 1996, when he opened up the country to more foreign trade and private investment.\n\nConsidered a political lightweight by some in India at that time, Singh was a surprise choice by the Congress party to be prime minister after it won parliamentary elections in 2004.\n\nAlongside a growth rate of almost 7 per cent, Singh\u2019s decade as premier was marred by allegations of widespread corruption against his party\u2019s leaders, although his personal integrity was rarely questioned.\n\nSingh was accused of inaction and opposition parties claimed he was subservient to Sonia Gandhi, Congress\u2019s chief at that time.\n\nShortly before Congress lost elections to Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party in 2014, Singh said in a speech to parliament that \u201chistory would be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter opposition parties\u201d.\n\nPrime Minister Modi on Thursday described Singh as one of India\u2019s most distinguished leaders, saying he left a \u201cstrong imprint on our economic policy over the years\u201d and had \u201cmade extensive efforts to improve people\u2019s lives\u201d as premier.\n\nRahul Gandhi, a senior member of the Congress party, paid tribute to Singh, saying he had lost a \u201cmentor and guide\u201d whose \u201chumility and deep understanding of economics inspired the nation\u201d.\n\nA member of parliament for more than three decades, Singh retired from active politics earlier this year.\n\nThe mild-mannered Singh, who belonged to India\u2019s minority Sikh community, was born to a humble family in 1932 in a village in India\u2019s Punjab province prior to the country\u2019s independence, which is now part of Pakistan.\n\nSingh rose to become one of India\u2019s most successful economists, serving the government in various capacities, including as head of the central bank in the 1980s.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/66ad6592-3764-443e-9298-e3fa30218e2d"}}, {"id": "c1275299-1f6c-473f-aa44-4580992eb7ce", "event_name": "India roars ahead of China to top Asian IPO rankings", "blurb": "Fast-growing Indian market behind only the US in money raised by company listings", "date": "2024-12-2600:00:00.0", "body": "India has eclipsed China as Asia\u2019s top market for company listings this year, as buoyant stock prices spark a boom in initial public offerings.\n\nPropelled by companies including Swiggy and Hyundai Motor, India will be the world\u2019s second-largest equity fundraising market behind the US for the first time, according to data from Dealogic for 2024.

Meanwhile, companies have rushed to take advantage of high valuations following a multiyear rally in Indian equities, despite concerns over whether the market can weather an economic slowdown.\u201cIt\u2019s been one of the most busiest times in the history of Indian capital markets,\u201d said V Jayasankar, a managing director at Kotak Investment Banking, which worked on some of the country\u2019s biggest IPOs this year. \u201cIndia is certainly getting noticed \u2014 China needs to probably do a lot more to really consistently attract that business.\u201dThe market has been buoyed by \u201cvery solid\u201d Indian domestic flows thanks to a significant \u201cdemocratisation of investment\u201d as households increasingly pour money into local equity markets, Jayasankar added. \u201cThe overall activity has taken us by a positive surprise.\u201d\n\nThe value of primary and secondary listings in mainland China, which in 2023 was the world\u2019s largest market, fell about 86 per cent from more than $48bn to just $7.5bn in 2024 by early December, according to Dealogic.\n\nAnalysts said that a weaker economy coupled with restrictive regulation on company listings has held up the pipeline of Chinese companies looking to enter public markets, although the announcement of monetary and fiscal stimulus plans in September has helped to stabilise markets after a sell-off earlier in the year.\n\nChina\u2019s IPO slowdown was in line with Beijing\u2019s policy aims, according to Scarlett Liu, Apac equity and derivative strategist at BNP Paribas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a regulatory attempt to achieve balance between primary and secondary market,\u201d she said, adding that authorities were concerned that too many listings could drain activity from secondary market trading.\n\nHong Kong, China\u2019s offshore financial hub, saw a relative increase in equity raising activity to more than $10bn by December from $6bn in 2023, including some large transactions such as electronics maker Midea raising more than $4bn in a secondary listing.\n\nAnalysts say Hong Kong will continue to benefit as a listing venue for mainland Chinese companies to raise offshore capital.\n\n\u201cFor Chinese companies pursuing IPOs, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange remains a top venue offering a more streamlined listing process, market stability and transparency, and greater access to global capital,\u201d said Frank Bi, partner and Asian practice head of corporate transactions at law firm Ashurst.\n\nIndia, which had a large volume of relatively smaller deals in 2024, has been buoyed by companies seeking to raise funds while valuations remain sky-high, including by spinning off Indian units of multinational companies such as Hyundai.\n\n\u201cObviously the number of transactions has gone up but the average ticket size per transaction is down about 75-80 per cent in the last two years,\u201d said one Mumbai-based banker. \u201cNow, what that tells me is [companies are thinking] \u2018run for the hills, let\u2019s try to cash in as quickly as we can, whatever we can while market conditions remain supportive\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut as the world\u2019s most populous nation\u2019s rapid growth slows, with corporates reporting weak earnings and GDP growth falling sharply to 5.4 per cent in the third quarter \u2014 the lowest rate in almost two years \u2014 foreign portfolio managers have turned cautious on its frothy equity market.They pulled more than $11bn out of Indian stocks in October, a record monthly exodus, as well as a further $2.5bn in November.\n\nHowever, bankers think that the wider exuberance in primary and secondary listings in India is likely to be sustained into the new year. \u201cNot to comment on the quality of the offerings,\u201d a second banker in Mumbai said, \u201cthere is enough activity lined up so long as the markets are supportive and the liquidity is there.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair to say that the first two quarters of 2025 will see no change from where we are right now,\u201d he added.\n\nGlobal investment bankers too remain bullish on India, while warning that its relative growth may be eclipsed by a larger comeback in the US and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cGlobally we expect the IPO market activity to normalise in 2025 and we will see a pick-up in volumes especially in the US and Europe and possibly also out of China.

We\u2019ll be in your inboxes next on December 31. Season\u2019s greetings and happy holidays!\n\nIt has been a sad year for Bollywood. In the first 10 months of this year, Indian box office collections were $1bn, down 7 per cent from the same period last year. What\u2019s more,\u00a02024\u2019s big hits were all from the south of the country, with Pushpa 2: The Rule and Kalki 2898 AD running to packed houses.\n\nViewer time and wallet share are severely fractured. There are a dozen Indian video streaming services, a few international ones, as well as competition from YouTube, Instagram Reels and other user-generated content vying for eyeballs. Watching a film in a multiplex is not a cheap exercise; the tickets are pricey and the popcorn pricier (scroll down for the appropriate tax rates). A large chunk of the audience now prefers to wait for the movie to land in a streaming service than watch it in cinemas.\n\nAt the same time, the costs of movie making have only increased. Despite the astronomical price tags that come with Bollywood\u2019s A-listers, big names\u00a0are no longer guaranteed to draw in crowds. In October, director Karan Johar, who had managed to seize the zeitgeist for the past two decades, sold a 50 per cent share in his Dharma Productions to vaccine billionaire Adar Poonawalla. The press release announcing the merger was telling; it talked about the challenges of the digital future without saying how the company planned to navigate it \u2014 only that it would need the resources to do so.\n\nThere are no simple fixes. It\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to tear people away from their devices and into theatres \u2014 and the Hindi film industry is suffering a crisis of confidence. As budgets bloat, production houses are playing it safe by falling back on the same old formula and not taking any creative risks.\n\nAjay Bijli, the head of India\u2019s largest multiplex operator PVR Inox, told the FT that Bollywood\u2019s content makers were still \u201cgrappling with what the consumer wants\u201d. Cinemas\u00a0are instead counting on big Hollywood films to fill up seats next year, and who can blame them? Just the names of major Bollywood releases for 2025 are enough to tell you their creative drought endures: there\u2019s War 2, Jolly LLB 3, and Housefull 5.\n\nDo you have any thoughts on how Bollywood can break its jinx?

As I grow older I worry that I didn\u2019t get as much done as I should have \u2014 the books that I didn\u2019t read, the holidays I didn\u2019t take, the stories I didn\u2019t write. This was a difficult year for me. Perhaps that\u2019s why, for a change, I can only remember the things I enjoyed. Here\u2019s a short list.\n\nThe three books I loved reading:\n\nI watched way too much TV this year, catching up on decades of missed shows and films. I came late to both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, but boy am I glad I got to them. I am hard pressed to think of another popular work of art that is a more complex meditation on good versus bad.\n\nI travelled quite a bit this year, and was left awestruck by Muir Woods in California and the fairy chimneys at Cappadocia. I also closed my eyes and plunged into the delightful madness that is New Orleans and lived to tell the tale. (My liver probably disagrees).\n\nMy intent for 2025 is to read and watch a lot more Indian regional content.

Sheikh Hasina has denied the allegations.\n\nThe diplomatic request will fuel tensions between New Delhi and Dhaka just weeks after India\u2019s foreign secretary visited Bangladesh to try to mend relations between the neighbours.\n\nA spokesperson for India\u2019s foreign ministry confirmed it had received a \u201cnote verbale from the Bangladesh High Commission today in connection with an extradition request\u201d, but declined to comment further.\n\nSheikh Hasina\u2019s dramatic toppling roused suspicion and concern in New Delhi, which has historically supported her Awami League, Bangladesh\u2019s oldest and biggest political party.\n\nRivals and rights groups have accused the Awami League of extrajudicial killings, bending state institutions to its whim and rigging elections. Many Indian officials believe the installation of Bangladesh\u2019s caretaker leader, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, was the result of a US-backed regime change.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has also raised concerns about the safety of minority Hindus in India\u2019s Muslim-majority neighbour. Yunus has acknowledged limited incidents of violence against Hindus, though human rights groups have not confirmed any mass atrocities.\n\nYunus told the Financial Times in October his government would not ask for Sheikh Hasina\u2019s extradition from its dominant south Asian neighbour until a verdict had been reached by the investigative tribunal, which last week extended the deadline for its probe into February.\n\nBut last month, Yunus called for her return following the arrest of dozens of former Bangladesh government officials and regime associates. In an address he said: \u201cWe will seek the extradition of the ousted autocrat from India.\u201d\n\nWhile Sheikh Hasina has not been seen in public since she left Bangladesh, she made a broadcast address earlier this month accusing Yunus, with whom she has long feuded, of being the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind the violence and her removal. The Awami League also claims his interim government has \u201cweaponised\u201d the country\u2019s institutions against them.\n\nSheikh Hasina denied she had ordered security forces to use lethal force against protesters and claimed the allegations against her were \u201cfalse propaganda\u201d and part of a \u201cconspiracy against us to push us out of power\u201d.\n\nHer son Sajeeb Wazed, who has also previously denied any wrongdoing by his mother, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA high court in Bangladesh earlier this month also ordered an investigation against Sheikh Hasina and her niece Tulip Siddiq, a UK Treasury minister, after their family was accused of embezzling $5bn.

Two weeks on the beach in Greece is our usual holiday speed, so travelling around India was a major step up. I\u2019d approached the trip with some trepidation, worried we\u2019d get ill \u2014 an Indian friend even suggested we take Imodium prophylactically \u2014 and that the multiple destinations and sensory overload would be too much for our kids; and to start with, it was.\n\nNegotiating Kolkata\u2019s steamy, marigold-strung Mullick Ghat flower market 10 days earlier, my daughter clutched my hand so hard I developed a bruise. But now, she and her younger brother strolled confidently ahead with their red and yellow backpacks.\n\nWe\u2019d come to India to visit Shuktara, a Kolkata-based charity my husband is involved with, and had decided to explore Rajasthan while we were here.\u00a0When I heard that Original Travel was launching a new tour of the region by rail, using the sorts of local trains millions of Indians take every day, I was keen to try it: I hoped it would \u200bi\u200bntroduce us to Rajasthani life in a way that criss-crossing the state in a hermetically sealed minibus might not.\n\nThe trip would take in the temples, palaces and forts of Rajasthan\u2019s Rajput and Mughal past, as well as exposing us to its rapidly changing present, with bespoke, family-friendly activities \u2014 including, we hoped, encounters with \u200ba\u200b couple of apex predators.\n\nAs well as booking our train seats (having read Monisha Rajesh\u2019s\u00a0Around India in 80 Trains,\u00a0I knew this was no mean feat) in air-conditioned carriages, and providing drivers and guides, the company\u2019s Delhi concierge would \u200balways\u00a0be on the end of a WhatsApp. If we were going to leave our sandcastle\u200b-building\u00a0comfort zone, this was the way to do it.\n\nThe rail journeys, it turned out, were high points of the holiday, not just for the hubbub of the stations and the views, but also because of the people we met. As the train left Jaipur and the sky turned a hazy pink, the city gave way to farmland dotted with haystacks that looked, we thought, like the straw houses from The Three Little Pigs.\n\nA samosa seller began his rounds and a couple across the aisle giggled through YouTube videos as the vast, milky Sambhar Salt Lake hove into sight. Later, I struck up conversation with a man on his way home for Diwali. \u201cMy brother likes crackers,\u201d he told me, when I asked him if he\u2019d be lighting fireworks. \u201cI prefer beer.\u201d\n\nOur train trip began in Delhi, where we stayed at the Imperial hotel, its marble and teak hallways decorated with photos of elephants leading processions, military regiments, and busts of King George V and Queen Mary. The next day, we swapped the hotel\u2019s jasmine-scented interiors for a rickshaw ride around the hectic streets of Old Delhi with our polymath guide, Robinson.\n\nSo much for food poisoning \u2014 the greatest health hazard of the holiday came in the form of a rampaging bull that spun around in front of us before collapsing from dizziness. Somehow, my husband and I managed not to convey our terror to the children, for whom the experience was a holiday highlight.\n\nThe following morning, we boarded the Gatiman Express for Agra, en route to the Taj Mahal. I found the sight of the white marble mausoleum at dawn, when it glowed like a pink pearl, spellbinding. But again, animals were the biggest draw for the junior members of the party, my son grabbing my phone to snap two Egyptian vultures perching on a minaret.\n\nOur next hotel also had royal connections. On the edge of the Aravalli hills, Six Senses Fort Barwara is an exquisite conversion of a 14th-century fort\u200b\u200b\u00a0built by the Chauhan Rajput clan. Ancient frescoes line the walls of the women\u2019s temple, now part of the spa, and though most of the building is new, including the swimming pool, with a raised platform on which my children lounged like mini maharajas, it melds elegantly with the original crenellations and domes.\n\nMost of our fellow guests here and at our other hotels were Indian tourists: the Covid pandemic, we were told repeatedly, persuaded prosperous Indians to discover their own backyards, just as it had for British holidaymakers in the UK.\n\nFort Barwara was our jumping-off point for Ranthambore National Park, an hour\u2019s drive west, where we went in search of tigers.\u00a0The closest my children had been to a safari was Whipsnade Zoo, and they were agog at the mongooses, sambar and spotted deer, and peacocks we saw on our afternoon drive.\n\nAn hour in, our 4x4 stopped, and\u00a0our guide Jyotirmoy Chaturvedi\u00a0pointed out tiger tracks\u200b. A series of \u200bloud\u00a0barks followed: warning calls from a sambar deer\u200b. We clung on as the vehicle shot off at high speed, pulses soaring. The tiger eluded us, but no one minded: being on a mission, binoculars clapped to our eyes, the rolling green-and-ochre landscape darkening as the light faded, was enough of a thrill.\n\nIn fact, our favourite part of the day came when we left the serene park in our open-top 4x4 and entered a maelstrom of daily life on the outskirts of Sawai Madhopur. Motorbikes hooted and swerved around marauding warthogs, goats and families of monkeys; children waved from balconies strung with neon Diwali lights as the smells of evening meals being cooked drifted by.\n\nFrom Sawai Madhopur, the closest station to Ranthambore, it was a two-hour train ride to Jaipur. That evening on our hotel\u2019s terrace: we were stunned to see over 100 kites swinging high above the Old City\u2019s rooftops, practice for Jaipur\u2019s\u00a0centuries-old kite festival.\n\nBuilt at the start of the 19th century,\u00a0Samode Haveli became a hotel in the 1980s\u200b,\u200b and members of the \u200baristocratic\u00a0Samode family still live there: \u200bs\u200btaff walk their dachshunds under a 200-year-old banyan tree\u200b.\u200b Jaipur\u2019s royal family still occupies its City Palace, too, as we saw first-hand: one minute we were admiring a photograph of 25-year-old Princess Gauravi Kumari, the next she was zooming past in a golf buggy.\n\nThe following day, we were driven \u200bto the village of Bagru, where the 400-year-old craft of block printing is going strong. We were shown bubbling vats of natural dyes and the pomegranate flowers used to fix the colours, before being invited to have a go. My daughter loved it, stamping her fabric \u200b\u200bso vigorously with the leaf blocks she\u2019d chosen that I was surprised we weren\u2019t printed head to toe by the time we left. Back at home, she used her new skill in a school art project, carving potatoes instead of wood.\n\nMy son is less interested in crafting but obsessed with cricket \u2014 no gender stereotypes here \u2014 and Original Travel had arranged for him to have a game with boys from Blue Heaven School, outside \u200bJaipur. While he picked up spin-bowling tips from Nardeep Rajawat, school director and former cricket pro, I chatted to his teenage teammates about their career plans. Most were would-be entrepreneurs; true Modi citizens, keen, they told me, to capitalise on India\u2019s raw materials and infrastructure.\u00a0India\u2019s GDP grew by about 7 per cent in 2024, a trajectory it was easy to imagine continuing as we chatted.\n\nBut as the economy has grown, wealth and income inequalities have widened, and we saw plenty of evidence of that during our trip, too. Before coming to India, my husband and I debated whether we should be exposing our children to the country\u2019s appalling poverty. \u201cIndia\u2019s got riches,\u201d my daughter observed, \u201cbut they\u2019re not shared out.\u201d If nothing else, I hope our trip made them realise how lucky they are with their cosy London lives, food in the fridge and drinkable water in the taps.\n\nAfter exploring Jodhpur\u2019s Mehrangarh fort, a feat of Rajput engineering that hovers 120 metres above the Thar desert and had the best arsenal of any fort we\u2019d visited \u2014 \u201cArms & Weapons\u201d signs, I\u2019d discovered, are catnip to eight- and nine-year-olds \u2014 we drove to three hours to our last stop. Suj\u00e1n Jawai is a spectacularly beautiful camp with just 10 tents, each with a terrace, bathtub and marble shower, in a wilderness area known for its leopards.\n\nLeopards are notoriously hard to spot, and after the tiger no-show we were prepared to be disappointed. Our intrepid zoologist-ranger, Siddarth Waradkar (\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, I was rescuing a 12-foot rock python,\u201d was his introduction), refused to be drawn on our chances either.\n\nBut within five minutes of leaving the camp, we found Baliraja, a dominant male leopard, beneath a tree. It was an emotional moment: we were so close we could see his chest rise and fall. \u201cHe winked at me,\u201d said my daughter.\u00a0That same afternoon, we watched a hefty eight-month-old cub stretch and yawn on a rock. Suj\u00e1n\u2019s rewilding efforts, which began a decade ago and included uprooting an invasive species of acacia, have helped increase the leopards\u2019 prey, and their population has risen by about 50 per cent.\n\nThe animals are now comfortable with humans \u2014 as long as they stay in their vehicles \u2014 hence our\u00a0\u200bup-close\u00a0sightings. The property has a community-focused approach to conservation: 90 per cent of the camp\u2019s staff, including its red-turbaned Rabari guards, come from local villages, and it sponsors 10 nearby schools.\n\nThe following morning, Sid received a call from one of the camp\u2019s spotters, and we sped towards Jawai dam (\u201cthis is literally like Mario Kart,\u201d said my son appreciatively as we rollercoastered over the granite rocks), where we found another cub, rolling on its back as if asking to be tickled. On our last dusk drive, cicadas chirping as loudly as alarm clocks, we were escorted back to Suj\u00e1n by a leopard that strolled six feet in front of our vehicle. \u201cHe\u2019s saying goodbye,\u201d said Sid.\n\nIn the end, it was the constant gearshifts I\u2019d worried about that made our tour of Rajasthan so magical. \u201cEverything\u2019s so different,\u201d said my children again and again: different from yesterday, and different from home. Hopping between cacophonous, kaleidoscopic cities and pristine wildernesses where big cats roamed hadn\u2019t just been electrifying, it had stretched our holiday horizons.\n\nAs\u00a0the kids stuck their train tickets in their journals and I put four unopened packets of Imodium in the bathroom cupboard, I\u00a0\u200bwondered if\u00a0we\u2019d ever be content with two weeks on the beach again.\n\nKate Maxwell is the author of \u2018Hush\u2019 (Virago)\n\nNote: this article has been corrected.

Even as Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink awaits government clearances to operate in India, its devices seem to be popping up in various parts of the country. In other news, a mostly unproductive winter session of parliament ends today; the only notable event is that the \u201cone nation, one election\u201d bill will be moved to a joint parliamentary committee. But first, one in three senior executives lie on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s!\n\nEven those at the very top lie in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. KPMG carried out a million background checks on job applicants in India over a year and found that 30 per cent of senior management and C-suite candidates had misrepresented themselves during the recruitment process. As a group, executives had a discrepancy rate comparable to applicants in real estate and infrastructure \u2014 the industry with the highest share of errant candidates (31 per cent). The average across different industries was 11 per cent.\n\nThis is not good news for companies. At the senior executive level, they found candidates misstating the actual reason for leaving a job, not mentioning legal disputes, as well as interpersonnel issues around how senior managers were treating their staff members.\n\nVideo interviews, that enduring post-pandemic legacy, also make it hard to assess candidates, especially on softer issues such as alignment with the company\u2019s culture and values. But technology is catching up, with digital tools that help detect interview impersonation (!) and document tampering. For senior managers, companies also conduct extensive background checks, gathering \u201chuman intelligence\u201d to ensure the candidate is the right fit for the job.\n\nJob hunt experts and interview coaches emphasise the importance of crafting your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for the job description. But that only means highlighting the roles and accomplishments that are most relevant for the job, not adding falsehoods. Hiring is an expensive process for corporations and rectifying wrong decisions even more so. Consequently, the use of sophisticated tools (now backed by AI) will only grow. Taking creative liberties with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s will be counter-productive.\n\nDo you have a story about fantastical r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or hilarious interviews?

Just this week, the billionaire rejected claims that the satellite communication devices were used in strife-torn Manipur, the second time in a fortnight that Starlink has been accused of facilitating\u00a0criminal activity in the country. Earlier this month, officials in the Andaman and Nicobar administration had sent a legal demand to the company\u2019s headquarters, seeking the name of the customer of the device used by smugglers who were caught in the island with $4.2bn worth of methamphetamine, according to news reports. Musk took to X to clarify that Starlink\u2019s satellite beams were turned off in India and that its use would not have been possible.\n\nThese accusations aside, the company, which registered its India operations in 2021, has long been seeking approvals from the Indian government to start its service. Currently, only Jio Satellite communications and Bharti-group backed OneWeb have licences. Security clearances are, rightly, a long and difficult process and it has been an especially fraught wait for Starlink. However, in October, the company got a boost when the government said it would not be auctioning spectrum for satellite broadband and instead would award it administratively. Jio\u2019s Mukesh Ambani and Airtel\u2019s Mittal were pushing for an auction. The whispers in New Delhi\u2019s corridors suggest that Musk will get a licence sooner rather than later. But this is a fight among giants \u2014 it\u2019s premature to predict anything.

India\u2019s stock market regulator would like to bring the benefits of algorithmic trading to all investors \u2014 it is currently restricted to foreign funds and proprietary traders. I\u2019m also keeping an eye on parliament, where there\u2019s talk that the One Nation One Election bill could be introduced this week. We\u2019ll know more today. Plus, the cost of India\u2019s huge spam call problem.\n\nLast Friday, after holding out for years, India\u2019s stock market regulator, Sebi, signalled that it was likely to open algorithmic trading to retail investors. In September, the board published a study that showed that algo trading was responsible for 97 and 96 per cent of the profits in the futures and options segment of foreign investors and proprietary traders respectively.\n\nSebi\u2019s draft guidelines are tight: each algorithm will have to be approved by the stock exchanges, and all orders will be tagged by unique identifiers so they can be traced and audited accurately. Even individual \u201ctech-savvy\u201d investors will be able to approach the exchanges through their brokers to register their algos. Sebi has split algos into two categories: white box, whose logic and rules are public, and black box algos, which are closed to external scrutiny. The regulator has codified specific rules for each, and mandated that stock exchanges have access to a kill switch in order to ensure that rogue algos don\u2019t result in price manipulations in the market.\n\nThe regulator is right to temper enthusiasm with caution in opening algo trading to all investors. The past few years have witnessed tremendous participation by retail investors \u2014 many of whom are young and technologically knowledgeable \u2014 in the stock markets, and it would be unfair to deprive them of the opportunities that large fund houses can enjoy. At the same time, the fast-paced nature of these transactions leaves investors vulnerable to big losses, especially in the futures and options segment. Additionally, there is the ever-looming shadow of fraud (which is inadvertently turning out to be the word of the day in today\u2019s newsletter) and it is the board\u2019s responsibility to protect investors from unscrupulous operators running dubious algorithms.\n\nInitial responses to these rules have criticised their tedious nature. Registering each algorithm with the stock exchange will most certainly be a time-consuming process. White box algos will be prone to easy duplication and institutional investors continue to have an edge because these restrictions do not apply to them. But Sebi is probably investing in the wisdom of taking baby steps. I don\u2019t blame them.\n\nThe draft guidelines are open for public comments until January 3. If you have any ideas or suggestions, head over to Sebi\u2019s website and record them.\n\nDo you think Sebi\u2019s rules are good for retail investors? Let me know at indiabrief@ft.com\n\nOver the past seven days, I received four spam calls on average each day. This is nearly three months after my mobile service provider, Airtel, launched its sophisticated AI-powered spam call filtering system. Last week, Airtel said the filter had flagged 8bn calls and 800mn messages in the 10 weeks since it was rolled out. That\u2019s a million spammers every day, which accounted for 6 per cent of all calls, the company said.\n\nThese numbers are staggering. Spam calls are not just a nuisance (anyone who has tried to take a nap on a weekend afternoon will use a stronger word than that), they are also the feeder system for cyber fraud. Indians lost Rs113.3bn to such frauds in the first nine months of this year, according to data reported from the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre. Stock trading and other investment scams constituted the largest chunk of this, accounting for more than 325,000 complaints filed. \u201cDigital arrests\u201d \u2014 a scam where uniformed (fake) law enforcement officials appear on video calls to extort victims \u2014 accounted for the second-highest share, with more than 63,000 people losing Rs16.16bn. They have become so prevalent that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautioned people against them in his radio programme. In most of these cases, the scamsters approached their victims through spam calls or messages.\n\nIn an interconnected world, it is not easy to wipe out cyber fraud. But it is puzzling why this is not a priority for the government and the telecom regulatory authority. There is, understandably, a high degree of suspicion about data security in India, and a leak-proof Do Not Disturb (DND) registry is step one in building trust in the system. It is also baffling that a year and a half after India\u2019s data protection act was enacted, the government has yet to notify the rules that will govern the legislation. With the success of UPI and the wide acceptance of digital payments, India is seeking to be a global leader in providing mass-market digital solutions. It is imperative that we get our act together on data security sooner rather than later.\n\nIndia\u2019s D Gukesh beat Ding Liren to become the youngest world chess champion.

Thank you for the messages, and please keep them coming.\n\nFor today: should India Inc look beyond the balance sheet and contribute to nation building? Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman urges companies to blend commercial considerations with the nation\u2019s priorities. I am also keeping an eye on the winter session of parliament, where chaos continues with the BJP and opposition parties butting heads on the political situation in Manipur, as well as the role of American billionaire George Soros in \u201cdestabilising India\u201d. Plus, how will Adani Group pay its big bills?\n\nIn a familiar admonishment, the finance minister told Indian CEOs this week that their commercial considerations should blend with the nation\u2019s priorities and strategic needs.\n\nWhile she elaborated on the requirement for large corporates to work with small and medium enterprises and focus on job creation, her primary bugbear is capital expenditure. In public and private, Sitharaman has expressed her frustration that Indian companies are not investing enough, and that the responsibility for capital expenditure is overwhelmingly carried by the government (although this has recently slowed; official figures showed that government capex grew only 5.4 per cent in the second quarter, a further drop from 7.5 per cent in the previous quarter).\n\nCorporations are not going to be let off easily. According to several news reports, the government has asked the National Statistical Office to conduct a survey of private capex, the results of which will be published in March. With high inflation and low GDP growth, the Indian economy is in a tight corner and the government needs all the help it can get. But shaming corporations into increasing their capital expenditure is not a sustainable way to grow the economy. It is the government\u2019s responsibility to ensure that conditions are favourable enough for private capital to be deployed.\n\nThe government wants India Inc to step up on the demand side, too. Last week, chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran urged companies to hire more and pay better. Listed companies are making higher profits while their wage costs are shrinking. It\u2019s self-destructive that there isn\u2019t adequate demand in the economy for the companies\u2019 own products to be bought, he pointed out.\n\nCorporate pay scales are determined by market forces and the low wage scale is a reflection of high unemployment. Even if they are responsible citizens, CEOs are paid to focus on their balance sheets and it is inevitable that if they can reduce wage costs, they will. You can either be a capitalist or socialist; it is difficult to be both.\n\nDo you think companies have a responsibility to the nation and not just their shareholders?

Adani had secured support for the project from the US International Development Finance Corporation in November 2023, after the short seller Hindenburg Research published its report accusing the company of manipulating its stock price. A US federal agency\u2019s backing\u00a0was seen as a ringing endorsement of the company and its business practices.\n\nA year later, Adani is in even bigger trouble after US prosecutors announced their decision to indict Gautam Adani and seven others. The big question now: how is Adani Group going to raise money? It has significant debts to service, with $1.7bn reportedly due in March, as well as high working capital requirements.\n\nLast month, after the news of the indictment broke, the company abandoned its $600mn bond offering for Adani Green Energy and reassured investors that the group\u2019s companies have enough cash to service their debts for the next 12 months. Infrastructure projects are expensive businesses to fund and even if the group has enough internal accruals to continue the port project and service its debts until March, it will have to find ways to raise funds soon.

My name is Veena Venugopal, and I\u2019m delighted to bring you news and insights from the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy every Tuesday and Friday. A bit about myself:\u00a0I started my career looking after European mergers and acquisitions for an IT company, before shifting gears and moving into journalism. In the two decades since, I\u2019ve covered everything from the Ambani brothers\u2019 feud to Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, and also written three non-fiction books.\n\nAs you will know, in India news is often noisy and distracting and it\u2019s difficult to keep up with everything. I\u2019ll use my years of experience to sift through the headlines and dive deep into the stories that really matter to make sure you are ahead of the curve. I\u2019d also love your feedback, so please write to me at indiabrief@ft.com, or just hit \u201cReply\u201d.\n\nOn to today\u2019s agenda. The government announced yesterday that Shaktikanta Das, whom local media had expected to stay on as Reserve Bank of India governor, will be replaced this week \u2014 more on this below. I\u2019ll also be keeping an eye on protesting farmers, who have paused their \u201cDelhi Chalo\u201d (Let\u2019s go to Delhi) march and are deciding on the next course of action. Plus, is the sheen wearing off the CFA certification? But first: five companies are set to float this week, including fintech MobiKwik tomorrow and Blackstone-backed International Gemological Institute on Friday; we take stock of the surge in India\u2019s initial public offerings.\n\nIPO fever has seized India all year. According to S&P Global, 298 companies have gone public this year and raised Rs1.4tn ($16.6bn) in total, a 140 per cent increase from last year. Riding on this euphoria, predictions for IPOs in 2025 are off the charts. The Indian unit of consumer electronics group, LG, is planning a big offering in 2025, following in the footsteps of Hyundai, the other South Korean major that listed its Indian subsidiary this year. News reports suggest even Walmart-majority owned Flipkart is headed to the primary market next year. Each new interview with investment bankers seems to yield larger numbers of both volume and value of deals.\n\nBut colour me sceptical. Audacious optimism and animal spirits are one thing, but ground reality is quite another. Global markets are entering the new year with a whole bunch of uncertainties \u2014 the security situation in the Middle East is volatile, in Europe governments are falling like ninepins, and going by everything announced so far, Donald Trump\u2019s presidency will keep everyone\u2019s nerves on edge. Volatile markets aren\u2019t the best IPO vessels, as we have seen during and in the aftermath of Covid. Even in the buoyant markets we witnessed this year, IPOs haven\u2019t had a very smooth run. Hyundai, which was the largest offering, closed its first day in the bourses 5.73 per cent down, and the stock is still trading below its listing price. MobiKwik, which floats tomorrow, has had to cut down its issue size three times since it first started planning an IPO in 2021. The debacle that was Paytm\u2019s listing is still fresh on everyone\u2019s mind and unlike in the pre-Covid era, investors are quicker to punish companies that value themselves too highly.\n\nIt is in the interest of investment bankers to be optimistic about the IPO market, but I\u2019ll be taking their projections for 2025 with a bagful of salt. If markets hold, it is likely that we will see a handful of big listings and a bunch of smaller ones. But liquidity and macroeconomic concerns will keep all exuberance in check. Companies and their bankers will have to get the timing and the valuation absolutely right. Even Bollywood cannot count on guaranteed blockbusters these days, much less capital markets.\n\nDo you think 2025 will be a record year for IPOs? Write to me at indiabrief@ft.com.\n\nIt\u2019s December, which means it\u2019s the season for Spotify Wrapped. The music streaming platform published some mind-boggling stats about what users loved around the world.\n\nA chartered financial analyst certification once granted easy entry to top investment houses, attracting high numbers of candidates hoping to get jobs in the US and Europe. But the qualification is now struggling to find takers. There were 163,000 exam registrations last year, down 40 per cent from the peak of 270,456 in 2019.\u00a0In particular, the number of Chinese students taking the exam has fallen as the country\u2019s economic downturn affected demand.\n\nSo should Indian finance aspirants be eager to take the exam? The CFA Institute expects India to be the fastest-rising market for investment professionals, growing 33 per cent in the next decade. But don\u2019t bring out the party hats yet. The Indian education system, which tends to create technically qualified but not very well-rounded individuals, plays spoilsport here too. The report makes a cautionary note that many Indian candidates who have completed all levels of the CFA exams fall short of industry requirements because they lack soft skills. The other threat is posed by technology. As machine learning and artificial intelligence advances, many of the quantitative aspects of financial analysis can be run without human expertise. The CFA Institute is racing to stay relevant in the light of these structural changes, and it is not optimistic about \u201chyper growth\u201d in the future. It does have some words of advice: If you are young and just starting out, make yourself technologically savvy, and for those in middle management, be better communicators and leaders. If you are a successful top analyst, you don\u2019t need their advice \u2014 you have it all figured out!\n\n\u2014 Uday Kotak, founder and director, Kotak Mahindra Bank\n\nEach week, we invite a top Indian business leader to tell us their mantra for work and life.

Before that, Indian media were reporting that Das was expected to secure an extension to his six-year term.\n\nDas had been praised for his steady hand on the currency and on regulation of India\u2019s financial industry. But ministers had publicly criticised him over the RBI\u2019s resistance to cutting interest rates amid rising inflation, which breached the central bank\u2019s 6 per cent upper target band in October.\n\nAs India\u2019s economy showed signs of weakening, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month voiced concern over high borrowing costs. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal had also criticised as \u201cabsolutely flawed\u201d the approach of considering rising food prices when setting interest rates.The government was \u201cclearly trying to pin the blame for slowing economic growth\u201d on the central bank, said Eswar Prasad, professor of economics at Cornell University.\n\n\u201cThis is an unfortunate and unwarranted action by the government that diminishes the independence of the RBI and will hamper its effectiveness in meeting its inflation target,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cThe credibility of the RBI is particularly important for managing the balancing act of cooling off inflation without damaging growth.\u201dIn an interview last month with the Financial Times, Das said that while India\u2019s economy was showing \u201ca mixed picture\u201d, the central bank\u2019s key focus was on damping inflation.Shilan Shah, deputy emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said the announcement was a surprise. The exit of Das, who was considered the \u201cmost hawkish member\u201d of the RBI\u2019s monetary policy committee, could mean rates would be eased at Malhotra\u2019s first rate-setting meeting in February, or even at an unscheduled meeting before then.\n\n\u201cThe appointment of Mr Malhotra could set a new direction for the RBI. Admittedly, at this very early stage not much is known about his monetary policy views,\u201d Shah said. \u201cBut in comments last week, he did voice considerably more concern over the health of the economy than Mr Das did during Friday\u2019s policy announcement.\u201d\n\nMalhotra, a civil servant of more than three decades\u2019 experience, last week urged government tax officers to prioritise the interests of the economy and \u201cnot kill the golden goose\u201d with excessive demands.\n\nAt Das\u2019s final policy meeting last week the RBI kept its key interest rate unchanged at the same 6.5 per cent level where it has been since early 2023. But the central bank also slashed its GDP forecast for the 2024-25 financial year to 6.6 per cent from 7.2 per cent.\n\nMadhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services in Mumbai, pointed out that the RBI would have a \u201cvery new MPC\u201d early next year, with deputy governor Michael Patra \u2014 seen as Das\u2019s \u201cright hand\u201d \u2014 set to depart in January. \u201cThe dynamics have changed.

The gorgeous, flamboyant fiction of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Julio Cort\u00e1zar came to Calcutta street bookshops via the late Gregory Rabassa\u2019s superb translations from Spanish to English; my grandmother first read out the Mahabharata to me in Kaliprasanna Singha\u2019s Bengali translation from the original Sanskrit.\n\nI played hopscotch with languages as a child, skipping between Bengali, English, Hindi, grazing alongside French, Spanish, Sanskrit. Translators ferried us from the banks of one language to another, bringing Malayalam writers into Hindi, Pushkin or Isabel Allende into Bengali. A poor translation could kill your love for a book stone-dead; a good translation breathed fresh life into the works of beloved writers. \u201cTo translate a book is to enter into a relationship with it, to approach and accompany it, to know it intimately, word by word, and to enjoy the comfort of its company in return,\u201d author and translator Jhumpa Lahiri wrote in Translating Myself and Others (2022).\n\nBut will translation remain human for much longer? The debates over AI and machine translation have been fiery this year. A month ago, Veen Bosch & Keuning \u2014 the largest publisher in the Netherlands \u2014 announced plans to experiment with AI translation for a limited number of commercial fiction titles. Industry giant HarperCollins asked authors for permission to use \u201cselect nonfiction backlist titles\u201d to train AI Language Learning Models (LLMs) for Microsoft. There is a widespread fear that these AI models may one day make authors \u2014 and translators \u2014 obsolete.\n\nMy own preference is strongly for human translations, but AI enthusiasts argue that not all human translations are phenomenal, and that a poor translation can kill a novel or a collection of poems. Human translation takes time and can be expensive for publishers; the promise of AI is that it might \u2014 if LLM models advance in the right direction \u2014 open up a whole new world of literature to readers, instantly. Even for publishers who prefer to keep more creative writing in the hands of a human expert, the temptation to use AI translations for textbooks and bare-bones non-fiction is likely to be irresistible.\n\nIn January 2024, the Society of Authors ran a survey, asking their 11,500 members (authors, illustrators and translators) for their views on the impact of generative AI on creative careers. The results speak to both the promise and threat of AI translations: more than a third of translators (37 per cent) polled said they had experimented with generative AI, 36 per cent of translators had already lost work because of generative AI, and 77 per cent believed that machine translation would negatively impact their income.\n\nCan LLMs and machines translate as intuitively as a human? Despite machine \u201challucinations\u201d, where generative AI produces false or misleading responses, and other early glitches, AI translation will improve, and will probably be adopted across the corporate world. This threat to the livelihood of creative translators comes at a time when there are more translation prizes, and greater appreciation of the work that they do \u2014 visible, and invisible. AI treats translation like a crossword or logic puzzle, looking for one correct answer. Some of the skills that translators possess \u2014 creativity, deft selection, an understanding of authorial intent \u2014 are purely human acts. And as ambassadors for authors and books, no AI model could hope to replace the figure of the translator.\n\nThe translator\u2019s role so often extends beyond the text. Jennifer Croft, who translates works from Polish, Ukrainian and Argentine Spanish into English, spent almost a decade pitching Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s 2007 novel, the Man Booker International winner Flights, to publishers. \u201cI am often the person who also sells those books, acting as a kind of agent for the authors I\u2019m translating,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s an aspect of translation that I think most people are not aware of.\u201d\n\nTranslators are writers, and translation is an act intimately tied to emotion, imagination, bodily experience. Charles Simic, the Serbian-American poet who died in 2023, told the Library of Congress that translation was \u201can act of love, an act of supreme empathy\u201d; to Daisy Rockwell, another star translator of authors such as Upendranath Ashk and Geetanjali Shree, the translator and the author are \u201cballroom dancers\u201d. And Idra Novey felt, when she was translating the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, \u201cas if I were placing my palms against her palms and could hear the beat of her sentences matching my own\u201d.\n\nNone of us can wish generative AI away, and there are plenty of fields where it might be a timesaver, a boon. But publishers must reflect on whether AI translations have any place in our creative lives. Back in 2011, the legendary translator Margaret Jull Costa said, \u201cEvery translator will produce a different version, because every reader or listener reads and listens differently.\u201d The miracle of a good translation, to her, was that it was \u201cas seductively fresh and original as the original.\u201d That is what I and other readers respond to so strongly; the dance between author and translator, one palm pressed against the other.\n\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Caf\u00e9 and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3dffda06-6fc9-4b7e-8f1c-ffdca20917af"}}, {"id": "542df044-65e4-4a10-9ad8-fa0ab3f8423b", "event_name": "India central bank cuts growth forecast", "blurb": "RBI holds rates and says economy has bottomed out", "date": "2024-12-0600:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s central bank on Friday sharply cut its growth forecast for this year, confirming a slowing trend in what has been one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies.\n\nBut the Reserve Bank of India kept its benchmark policy interest rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent, citing an unexpected increase in inflation, and said the economy was showing signs of bottoming out.\n\nThe RBI said it now estimated growth for the 2024-25 financial year would be 6.6 per cent, compared with a previous estimate of 7.2 per cent.\n\nIts downgrade to expectations came a week after India announced GDP growth of 5.4 per cent year on year for the quarter to the end of September, the weakest performance in nearly two years.\n\nIndia\u2019s recent record of strong economic growth has underpinned support for Narendra Modi, who won a third term as prime minister in June.

It accused the 62-year-old Adani, who is widely seen as having close ties to Modi, of personally meeting a government official as part of efforts to \u201ccorruptly persuade\u201d authorities.\n\nThe allegations have highlighted the barriers to India\u2019s rapid solar sector expansion and raised questions about its ability to meet clean energy targets. Analysts and Modi opponents said they could constrain financing for future Indian solar projects, if foreign investors and creditors increased their risk premiums for lending or avoided Indian projects entirely.\n\nAs set out by the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the events that led to Adani allegedly resorting to bribery began about six years ago, when Indian policymakers were trying to encourage domestic solar panel manufacturing.\n\nIndia was seeking to transform itself into a clean energy superpower but government officials voiced concerns about its growing reliance on technology made in China, the world\u2019s largest producer of solar panels.\n\nTo tackle the problem, officials slapped tariffs on Chinese solar imports in 2018. Meanwhile the state-owned Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), which is tasked with pushing the industry forward, devised a solar power purchase tender with a twist.\n\nInterested companies would have to produce both electricity and solar panels, in the hope this would jump-start domestic production. The tender initially struggled to attract interest, with solar farm developers nervous about taking on risky manufacturing.\n\nBut after delays and revisions, in June 2020 two winners emerged: Adani Green Energy, the renewables division of the Adani Group; and Azure Power, a renewables developer headquartered in New Delhi and part-owned by Canadian pension fund Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nThe deals were transformative for the companies, covering up to 12GW of solar projects \u2014 enough for millions of homes \u2014 and capacity to produce 3GW of solar panels a year, combined. Analysts at the time said Adani Green would make \u201cmore than a billion\u201d in profit from the deals, according to the SEC complaint.\n\nThe optimism soon soured. In order to finalise the deals, SECI had to persuade state-owned regional electricity distributors to buy the power at the price the state corporation had agreed with Adani and Azure. Yet with market prices falling, distributors balked, and the deals stalled.\n\nThe agreed price of the electricity was unusually high because of the photovoltaic manufacturing requirement included in the deals. That structure proved so unwieldy that India never did a manufacturing-linked auction again. Adani Green eventually opened a solar manufacturing plant this year; Azure never did.\n\nAnother obstacle was that most of India\u2019s regional electricity distributors are under financial strain because they are forced to sell electricity below cost.\n\nAs months passed, with no final contracts signed with the regional distributors, executives at Adani Green and Azure resorted to corruption, US prosecutors alleged. They alleged the largest bribe of $228mn was offered to an official Gautam Adani met in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe alleged scheme appeared to work: Between July and December 2021, several electricity distribution networks signed deals with SECI, including in Andhra Pradesh, allowing the state corporation to move ahead with its deals with Adani Green and Azure.\n\nIn December 2021 \u2014 a month after Modi\u2019s appearance at the Glasgow climate talks \u2014 Gautam Adani welcomed the finalising of the \u201cworld\u2019s largest green power purchase agreement\u201d of 4.6GW with SECI.\n\nToday, Adani Green is the biggest solar operator in India by operating capacity and reported net profits of Rs11bn ($130mn) for the year to March 31.\n\nBut the \u201crecord-setting\u201d solar awards at the heart of the alleged bribery scheme have not turned out as planned. None of the projects have yet been completed, according to consultancy Rystad Energy.\n\nIt took Adani until December 2023 to sell the last tranche of the power it was awarded in the 2020 auction. Azure still has about 2GW of the award unsold, according to SECI data.\n\nDevelopers across India are struggling to secure electricity sales contracts for renewables projects that have been awarded, stalling construction. About 10GW of this \u201cunsold\u201d capacity is hanging over the market.\n\nSushma Jagannath, Rystad\u2019s vice-president for renewables and power, said the Adani bribery allegations were likely to have a knock-on effect on the solar sector. \u201cThings like this can often discourage international players from investing in the Indian market,\u201d Jagannath said.\n\nSince the US allegations last month, TotalEnergies, Adani\u2019s biggest foreign partner on renewable and other energy projects, has suspended fresh investment in joint energy projects with the group.\n\nPawan Khera, head of communications for the Indian National Congress, the country\u2019s largest opposition party, said the allegations against Adani raised concerns that could \u201cimpact the quality and cost-effectiveness of solar projects in India\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny reputational damage or financial constraints faced by the conglomerate could cause significant setbacks in achieving India\u2019s climate goals,\u201d Khera added.\n\nAdani is one of a limited number of Indian groups able to execute big projects commensurate with the country\u2019s solar ambitions, said Rahul Tongia, senior fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, a think-tank.\n\n\u201cSome players have scale, some have manufacturing, some have better financing and global reach,\u201d Tongia said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t so many that have all of the above.\u201d\n\nAdani Group has called the US allegations \u201cbaseless\u201d and said it was seeking all \u201cpossible legal recourse\u201d. India\u2019s government has described the charges as \u201ca legal matter involving private firms and individuals and the US Department of Justice\u201d.\n\nIndia has made undeniable progress in renewable power. When Modi set a 2030 target of 500GW of non-fossil fuel capacity in Glasgow in 2021, the country had about 150GW, a level since increased to more than 200GW, according to government data.\n\nBut the sector has problems beyond alleged official corruption. Jagannath said an unprepared electricity grid and lack of long-distance transmission had become a bottleneck for renewables growth.\n\nEarlier this year, Modi\u2019s government quietly moved its target for reaching 500GW of non-fossil energy back two years to 2032.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e767eaba-1016-4380-96b3-bfcd1f6eaff1"}}, {"id": "181cfd61-ced0-47c8-b5f4-7fcc5dd3d1e5", "event_name": "Indian steelmaker JSW to launch own EV brand ", "blurb": "Company already has joint venture with China\u2019s SAIC in world\u2019s third-largest car market", "date": "2024-12-0200:00:00.0", "body": "JSW plans to launch its own electric vehicles brand, its chair and family owner Sajjan Jindal has said, signalling a move by the Indian steelmaker to become a significant player in the country\u2019s growing EV sector.\n\nJSW\u2019s plans for its own in-house EV brand follow\u00a0its announcement in March of a $1.5bn joint venture with SAIC Motor to build and sell the Chinese carmaker\u2019s MG-brand EVs in the world\u2019s most populous country and third-largest car market.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Jindal said JSW\u2019s planned car plant in Aurangabad in India\u2019s western Maharashtra state would be devoted to its own brand, revealing for the first time an aim to build vehicles under its own name.\n\n\u201cOur idea is not to be an outpost of a Chinese company to sell products in India,\u201d Jindal told the FT. \u201cWe want to manufacture the products in India, value-add in India and sell in India.\u201d\n\nIn launching its own brand, JSW would be entering a field of EV makers in India that includes Tata Motors, Mahindra and Ola Electric.\n\nJindal gave no further details of his group\u2019s plans for investment or the specific vehicles to be produced. However, in a post on X in October, Aurangabad Industrial City, an industrial park in Maharashtra, welcomed JSW for what it said would be a Rs272bn ($3.2bn) investment set to make EVs and commercial vehicles and create 5,200 jobs.\n\nWhile sales of battery-powered two-wheel vehicles have soared in India in recent years with the help of subsidies, demand for full-size EVs has developed more slowly.\n\nThis contrasts with India\u2019s arch-rival China, where government subsidies and incentives for producers and buyers have prompted mass uptake.\n\nElectric car sales in India total only about 100,000 units a year, accounting for about 2 per cent of the passenger car market, according to S&P Global Mobility, but sales are starting to take off among more affluent Indians.\n\nMG Motor India in September launched its Windsor crossover EV, priced at about $17,000. According to the company the model is \u201cfully booked\u201d for the next few months, with\u00a0sales capped at 50,000 this year because its plant in Gujarat does not have capacity to produce more.\n\nNarendra Modi\u2019s government last year vetoed a proposal by China\u2019s BYD, which is vying with Tesla to become the world\u2019s top-selling EV brand, to set up a plant in Hyderabad in a JV with local company Megha Engineering. BYD recently set up a partnership in neighbouring Pakistan, where it aims to make EVs by 2026.\n\nModi\u2019s government in 2020 enforced some of Asia\u2019s strictest curbs on Chinese investment against the backdrop of fatal border clashes in the Himalayas, forcing companies from neighbouring countries to secure government approval to invest.\n\nSAIC entered the JV with JSW after finding that cash for its operation in India was \u201cnot coming through\u201d because of government controls, Jindal said.

Just ask All We Imagine As Light. In this luminous breakthrough from Indian director Payal Kapadia, the backdrop is Mumbai, rhapsodic under blue-black skies. Streets pulse, trains glow. \u201cEvenings are my favourite time of day,\u201d a voice remarks. \u201cIn Mumbai, it feels like the day has just begun.\u201d\n\nYet one of the intriguing things about this poised drama is that the first major character is exhausted by evening. She is Prabha (Kani Kusruti), a hospital nurse both mournful and steely.\n\nBut then, the whole film is subtly double-edged. One moment, Mumbai can feel like any other urban centre, all blank commuters and hanging cranes; the next, uniquely itself, with heat and rain as supporting characters. Kapadia\u2019s film won the Grand Prix at Cannes, and comes with classical arthouse flourishes: shades of 1950s Neo-Realism and 1960s New Wave. It also feels distinctly modern, popping with deep colour. The mood is melancholy: Prabha\u2019s husband has left her for Europe. Then it turns airy and jazzy.\n\nSome of that energy comes from a second female lead: brash hospital receptionist Anu (Divya Prabha), who is also Prabha\u2019s younger roommate. We first meet her telling a patient the state now offers 1,000 rupees and a bucket to any man willing to have a vasectomy. That detail sticks in the mind \u2014\u00a0but the vivid sense of character is more striking still. The film needs only tiny moments to bring alive Anu, the haunted Prabha and their semi-friendship, making them our focus even as it reminds us the city is home to endless other characters.\n\nTo underscore that, the voices of actual Mumbaikars sometimes overlay the scenes on screen, discussing what brought them here. (Typically, economics or heartbreak.) But the story too is rooted in the real. Anu has a secret Muslim boyfriend, perilous in contemporary India, while property developers upend a third heroine, hospital cook Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam).\n\nHer part in the film finally nudges it out of Mumbai, into coastal country. What follows is still compelling, but two-sided again: you realise why people leave the city, and why they long to get back there.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nIn UK cinemas from November 29 and in US cinemas now", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7848feeb-e0c4-455f-8ce2-50ca8242ba8c"}}, {"id": "73b15c0d-7e7d-420d-a77c-58fffdd6e49b", "event_name": "The path to \u2018Made in India\u2019", "blurb": "Industrialisation is within the country\u2019s reach, but government has got to get out of the way first", "date": "2024-11-2800:00:00.0", "body": "The toyshop at Mumbai airport presents a peculiar dilemma to the traveller seeking a souvenir for a child. There is an impressive collection of educational toys, testament to the aspiration of India\u2019s upwardly mobile middle class, and a wide selection of plastic tat, testament to the preferences of children everywhere. But at least half of these basic items, for sale in the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy, were manufactured not in India but in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nFrom a Pinky the Pig plushie (designed in the UK, says the box, with a union jack on the front; country of origin \u2014 China, says the label, in small letters on the back) to a plastic lunchbox, it currently makes sense to produce these basic goods in China, with a per capita income of $12,614, pay any applicable tariffs, and ship them to India, where average incomes \u2014 and thus labour costs \u2014 are just one-fifth of that level at $2,485. This requires some explanation.\n\nWhat requires even more attention is corporate India\u2019s seeming lack of appetite to seize these markets: business investment is the missing part of the country\u2019s otherwise impressive growth story. While new capital formation is steady at about one-third of India\u2019s economy, driven by spending on housing and infrastructure, corporate fixed assets grew at just 5.5 per cent over the past year, well below the rate of expansion for the economy as a whole, according to figures from the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy.\n\nFor a long time, debt and underdevelopment seemed like the natural explanation for this sluggishness. In the wake of the global financial crisis, India suffered from a \u201ctwin balance sheet problem\u201d, with an overleveraged corporate sector struggling to service its loans, while banks, weighed down by non-performing assets, were reluctant to extend new credit. The lack of adequate infrastructure \u2014 roads, ports, water, electricity \u2014 created painful obstacles to industrial development of all kinds.\n\nTo its considerable credit, the government of Narendra Modi has tackled these issues. It has invested heavily in infrastructure, maintained budget discipline, and backed the Reserve Bank of India to control inflation and clean up the banks. Macroeconomically, India is now in good shape. With equity markets strong, credit available and an enormous tailwind from India\u2019s youthful demographics, there are no obvious constraints. Slow investment is about micro, not macro; about desire, not ability.\n\nOne potential reason for the lack of investment appetite in manufacturing is the extraordinary scale and competitiveness of China, which casts a long shadow over rich and poor countries alike. But the recent success of export-led growth in Vietnam and Bangladesh shows China cannot be the whole of the story. In garments and electronic assembly, they have gained from the desire to diversify supply chains, whereas India has not to the same extent.\n\nYet from the perspective of a small industrialist in India, who might invest in a toy factory, this is not so hard to understand. They face many hurdles. The government seems to favour large companies and advanced industries: it has offered tens of billions of dollars in so-called production-linked incentives to foster industries such as electronics and semiconductors, but these sectors are too far up the value chain for India to succeed easily, and will not create that many jobs if they do. Then there is the fear of India\u2019s largest conglomerates, which have pushed aggressively into the digital economy, and are widely believed to enjoy political favour. Giants such as Reliance, Tata and Adani are happy to invest. The problem is further down.\n\nSome businesspeople complain that the 2016 revision of the bankruptcy code is harsh and that bankers fear the punishment for non-performing loans too much to take a risk. In many parts of India, it is still costly to start or exit from a business due to labour and other laws. The ability to grow large without attracting a huge rival into the market and to limit downside when a business fails are both essential to entrepreneurs.\n\nIf a small industrialist wants to export, meanwhile, the hurdles are even higher. Most trade today is part of a global value chain, but from 2018 the Modi government began to raise tariffs, including on intermediate inputs such as printed circuit boards and displays. Regardless of whether this fosters domestic output of the protected goods, it makes India less competitive. According to the World Bank, India\u2019s backward participation in value chains, where its exports incorporate foreign inputs, fell from more than 25 per cent of total exports in 2010 to about 15 per cent by 2020. Meanwhile, India has few free trade deals with wealthy economies, yet competes with rivals that do. India\u2019s reluctance to join pan-Asian trade agreements and further open its economy to China is understandable. Bilateral trade deals with countries such as the UK, however, make sense.\n\nThe good news is that much of the hardest work has been done. Many of the obstacles to Indian industry do not require big expenditures or the most painful reforms; they mainly involve getting out of the way so the dynamism of India\u2019s young entrepreneurs can shine through. Do that, and \u201cMade in India\u201d can become as ubiquitous as \u201cMade in China\u201d is today.\n\nrobin.harding@ft.com", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1acd08b1-7e78-477f-8bca-412037a2db6e"}}, {"id": "ab3a80bb-c02f-4ec4-9bb9-a5a223d02bb8", "event_name": "\u2018Adios Adani!\u2019 Bribery charges threaten group\u2019s Africa ambitions", "blurb": "Kenya\u2019s reversal of support for airport project underlines global ramifications of US indictment", "date": "2024-11-2700:00:00.0", "body": "For Nelson Amenya, Adani Group\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d attempt to take over Kenya\u2019s main airport in a $1.85bn leasing proposal was always \u201cone big red flag\u201d.

Adios Adani!!!\u201d he said on social media after President William Ruto tore up $2.6bn in proposed deals with companies owned by one of India\u2019s richest men, who is accused by US prosecutors of involvement in a $265mn bribery scheme.\n\nRuto said in a televised address to the nation on Thursday that he had told officials to \u201cimmediately cancel\u201d the proposal for the Adani group to expand Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, as well as a $736mn investment in power lines.\n\nThe reversal of the Kenyan government\u2019s support for Adani\u2019s involvement in infrastructure projects was \u201cbased on new information provided by our investigative agencies and partner nations\u201d, he said.Kenya\u2019s decision underlined the global ramifications for Adani\u2019s companies after he was indicted for alleged securities fraud in connection with the alleged bribery scheme. It is another blow to the group just as it was seeking to rebuild its reputation after a short seller accused it of stock-price manipulation and fraud last year. Adani Group has said the US charges are \u201cbaseless\u201d.The plan for Adani to refurbish and run one of Africa\u2019s busiest travel hubs was part of a strategy to expand its presence on the continent, which had already led to it investing in a port and proposing a $900mn power lines project in Tanzania. Adani is also exploring projects in Morocco, Egypt and Zambia.\n\nBut it was the proposed arrangement with Kenya\u2019s aviation authority that thrust Adani into the spotlight as the country was also reeling from mass protests over tax increases. Local critics accused the company and the government of opacity in their dealings.\n\nFor Kenyan officials, the proposed deal was touted as a way to fix key infrastructure without adding to the country\u2019s debt, which takes up about 70 per cent of government revenue to service.\n\nBut when Amenya exposed the proposal, which was leaked to him by government officials in July, it sparked protests and an online campaign with hashtags\u00a0#stopadani and #rejectadani.\n\n\u201cKenya is in a tight spot and I think Adani took advantage of it,\u201d Amenya told the Financial Times.Even before last week\u2019s developments in the US, the problems in Kenya had led to the Adani group souring on its broader Africa expansion plans, which were also seen as key to India\u2019s geopolitical ambitions.\u201cIt\u2019s not worth it,\u201d said a person close to Adani. \u201cWe just walked into the middle of a brawl\u201d the person added, referring to the protests that forced Ruto to drop the proposed tax measures in June. Kenya\u2019s High Court had temporarily blocked the planned airport concession in September and last month the power line proposal between an Adani subsidiary and state-owned utility Ketraco.\n\nFaith Odhiambo, president of the Law Society of Kenya, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits that have stalled the projects, said the proposals were characterised by a lack of transparency.\n\nAmenya also criticised Adani for submitting a \u201cprivately initiated proposal\u201d for the airport concession, rather than competing in an open bidding process. However, the person close to Adani said it was Kenyan officials who raised the option of bypassing a tender process.\n\nThe plan was also controversial\u00a0with local activists because it did not oblige Adani to upgrade the existing runway until 2048 or to build a second one unless a jump in passenger traffic justifies the investment. That was despite the government having previously said this would be needed.They were also incensed by a clause that would have given the Indian company an 18 per cent equity stake in the airport even after the concession period had expired.\n\nLocal analysts also feared that a recent decision by Adani Power to cut electricity supplies to Bangladesh over an unpaid bill of $800mn could be the harbinger for Kenya if the country partners with the company to build power lines and power stations.\n\nThe Kenyan furore was just one sour note in Adani\u2019s patchy international strategy, which has seen his conglomerate set up port projects in Israel and Sri Lanka, while also courting neighbours such as Bhutan.\n\nIt pulled out of Myanmar last year following a military coup in 2021, while its ports and renewable project agreements in Sri Lanka fuelled local resentment and led the new government in Colombo to reconsider approving a wind project.\n\nAdani has expanded his businesses in tandem with development goals set by India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he has known since the premier\u2019s days as chief minister of their home state of Gujarat. Modi urged Indian corporates to become \u201cmultinational\u201d soon after taking office in 2014, although Adani has always denied receiving preferential treatment from the government. India sees opportunities for its companies from Africa\u2019s natural resources and growing population.\n\nDeals such as those being pursued by Adani can help India expand its influence despite lacking the financial firepower to compete with China in the global south, said Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, south Asia practice head at Eurasia Group. \u201cThere are almost no other companies in India with the scale or the capacity to build billion-dollar ports in far-flung parts of the world,\u201d Chaudhuri said.\n\nAdani only came to Kenya because officials in the country had invited the group to consider investing in the refurbishment of the port in Mombasa and to look at the country\u2019s transmission network, the person close to the company said. The airport project only came up later, they added.\u201cThe main problem with this Adani enterprise has to do with the process \u2014 it was never open and transparent,\u201d\u00a0said Moses Ndiema, secretary-general of Kenya\u2019s aviation workers union, whose members were among airport workers who went on strike in September chanting \u201cAdani must go\u201d.\n\nTheir wishes have come true and Amenya was showered with online accolades both in Kenya and India after Ruto\u2019s decision. \u201cAdani will fall soon!\u201d he said.\n\nThis article has been amended since publication to clarify that Gautam Adani was charged with alleged securities fraud", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3694f5cf-8ad4-4d60-9ebf-f039456a74be"}}, {"id": "53792c56-2501-4674-a0ba-ce2f1e050494", "event_name": "Infosys chair bets companies will develop their own AI models", "blurb": "Nandan Nilekani says small language models trained on specific data are \u2018quite effective\u2019", "date": "2024-11-2700:00:00.0", "body": "Indian technology grandee Nandan Nilekani expects companies around the world will increasingly build their own smaller-scale artificial intelligence models to streamline operations and boost productivity, dampening hope of a substantial enterprise payday for more powerful generative products.\n\nThe chair of IT services major Infosys told the Financial Times he was \u201cnot so sure\u201d companies would want to shoulder the high costs and the potential \u201cblack box\u201d of data and copyright liabilities associated with large language models behind popular applications, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the large firms they\u2019re all saying: \u2018How do we take charge of our AI destiny?\u2019\u201d Nilekani said in an interview in Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India. \u201cSmall language models trained on very specific data are actually quite effective\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009everybody will build models, but I think they don\u2019t have to build these gigantic ones.\u201d\n\nNilekani said enterprise customers would call in LLMs for specific applications and the technology would fuel competition between the giants, such as Google and Apple, which offer online products to consumers.\n\nBut his prediction raises questions about the revenue model for start-ups that have invested in LLMs. Facing hesitation from businesses, the likes of Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft have all recently released AI models with fewer \u201cparameters\u201d \u2014 the number of variables used to train their systems and shape output.\n\nInfosys, the nearly $19bn annual revenue software and consulting business that Nilekani co-founded in 1981, is positioning itself to be an AI provider to the clients it serves across more than 50 countries, helping them to organise their data and train their own models.\n\nNilekani highlighted Infosys\u2019 company launch last month of two small language models in partnership with AI chip group Nvidia. They were trained on Infosys data and integrated in products such as its digital banking software Finacle.\n\n\u201cWe are actually offering a service to our clients to build a model\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there\u2019s a lot of interest in that because we are demystifying this whole model-building stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole technology has become so easy that you can build models in a matter of months.\u201d\n\nSome analysts have raised concerns that India\u2019s outsourcing industry will suffer as more companies adopt technologically sophisticated AI models, with value flowing to software providers and the so-called hyperscalers of cloud services. If companies build their own models, however, then the technology will be an opportunity and not a threat for companies such as Infosys.\n\nNilekani, a fatherly figure of Indian tech who has been central to efforts shaping the government\u2019s digital policies and landmark Aadhaar biometric identity system, said AI would replace some functions in his country\u2019s tech industry \u2014 but new roles marshalling its power would crop up.\n\nThe Indian services sector has struggled with subdued growth and has slowed down hiring in recent years as customers, including Wall Street banks, cut back on IT spending.\n\nNilekani did not expect a large pick-up in headcount across India\u2019s tech services industry, which employs more than 5mn people. Partly because of advances in AI, but also due to a weak global economy, they \u201cmay not grow as they had grown in the past\u201d, he said.\n\nThe industry is one of India\u2019s few large sources of white-collar work in a country of 1.4bn people that is struggling to create meaningful jobs to soak up its young and vast labour force.\n\nAt the same time, the Infosys chair said Donald Trump\u2019s re-election might spur the industry, even though Indian IT companies were affected by his last crackdown on H-1B visas, which companies in the US use to bring in skilled foreign workers for a limited number of years.\n\n\u201cThe bull case is that this will unleash market deregulation, businesses will grow, people will do more acquisitions and therefore there will be more activity and therefore IT guys will benefit from it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy own sense is that they will probably support legal migration, which makes sense.

But distancing itself from one of India\u2019s richest men, and the business that flows from his sprawling infrastructure group, could have consequences too.\n\nIn a sign of the international impact of the US charges against Adani, French oil major TotalEnergies on Monday announced it had suspended fresh investments in joint projects with Adani Group, saying the conglomerate had not informed it of the corruption probe.\n\nLike Total, Jefferies continued to work with Adani after US short seller Hindenburg Research in January 2023 accused the group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud, allegations it has strenuously denied.\n\nExecutives at Jefferies internally debated whether it should keep Adani as a client in the wake of the Hindenburg report, according to people involved in the discussions. The bank was at the time acting as one of three lead managers on a planned $2.4bn Adani share offering, and made the controversial decision to press ahead with it even as international investors took stock of the group\u2019s financial position.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a client of Jefferies, questioned how banks involved in the equity offering could allow it to close without proper due diligence on the allegations made by Hindenburg. \u201cThere is just too much liability exposure for the banks,\u201d he wrote on X in late January last year.\n\nAdani chose to pull the offering after international investors largely withdrew their interest, but Jefferies had one foreign buyer lined up.\n\nIn March 2023, the bank brokered a deal in which Florida\u2019s GQG Partners ploughed $1.9bn into four Adani Group companies. On professional networking platform LinkedIn, Jefferies said it was \u201cpleased to have brokered a landmark transaction\u201d that would be \u201ca compelling long-term value investment\u201d for GQG.\n\nJefferies\u2019 relationship with Adani has helped the bank to expand quickly in India, a fast-growing market in which it has gone in a few years from being a small player to making more money in fees from advising on equity-raising than any other international bank.\n\nThe bank has leapt to second place in a fees league table, figures from Dealogic show, behind only India\u2019s ICICI. Last year, it was in eighth place and in 2019 as low as 32nd.\n\nTwo deals that helped propel it to second place were a $500mn Adani Enterprises share sale in October, and a $1bn Adani Energy Solutions fundraise in August.\n\nLast year Jefferies\u2019 investment banking fee revenue in India jumped to $44.9mn, close to four times the sum it had made in any year since at least 2014, figures from the London Stock Exchange Group show. So far this year, it has already topped that, with $57mn in fees. It is not clear how much of that revenue comes from Adani companies.\n\nAashish Agarwal, Jefferies\u2019 India country head, told the Financial Times last year the bank was \u201cdeeply focused on\u201d India, where it had undertaken 50 transactions in the past three years. \u201cSix to seven\u201d were for GQG, he said, including helping it buy stakes in Adani companies after the Hindenburg report.\n\n\u201cWe believe in partnering with our clients, in good times helping them to raise money, in tough times consolidating, whatever it requires,\u201d he said.\n\nJefferies is the only foreign bank to have advised Adani companies on equity issuance since the Hindenburg report, according to Dealogic figures, though the data provider cautioned that it did not have \u201cfull visibility\u201d because of Adani Group\u2019s complicated structure.\n\nSome European banks have worked for Adani on debt issuance since the Hindenburg report, though US-based groups have not. Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered were among the bookrunners when Adani Green Energy issued bonds in March. All three banks declined to comment.\n\nThe US indictments allege that Adani Green under its executive director Sagar Adani, Gautam Adani\u2019s nephew, engaged in a \u201clucrative\u201d bribery scheme to win Indian solar power supply contracts. They say the scheme was concealed from US investors and banks from which Adani and associates raised billions of dollars.\n\nJefferies\u2019 India business was listed as holding a 3 per cent stake in Adani Transmission as of June 2023, filings show, though it is not named in more recent filings. It is not clear whether the bank was holding the stake itself or on behalf of a client.\n\nJefferies initiated coverage on Adani Green in July with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, largely based on the company\u2019s \u201cprudent capital management\u201d and its \u201cgame-changing\u201d project to build the largest solar plants in the world at Khavda in the Indian state of Gujarat.\n\nThe bank predicted Adani Green shares could shoot up by 75 per cent in a best-case scenario. After a sharp fall following news of the US charges, the shares traded on Tuesday down more than 45 per cent from the July 1 level.\n\nJefferies declined to comment on its relationship with the conglomerate or on the US charges against Adani. Adani Group has said the charges are \u201cbaseless\u201d and that \u201call possible legal recourse will be sought\u201d.\n\nAs recently as last month, a senior Jefferies executive was privately touting its relationship with Adani as a success. But a person close to Jefferies said it was not currently doing any work for Adani and any future business would be considered as and when it came in, an indication of the difficult line the bank is now trying to tread.\n\nThe bank has in the past offered public solidarity for Adani. \u201cOne year ago we began a business relationship with @gautam_adani. Today we are proud to be true partners,\u201d Jefferies chief executive Rich Handler posted on the social media platform X earlier this year.

He added that it was \u201cvery risky\u201d to give forward guidance on rates \u201cwith so many uncertainties all around\u201d, but noted that \u201cheadline inflation is our target and rightly so\u201d.\n\nIndia\u2019s economy and equity markets are also showing signs of cooling. A set of weak quarterly corporate earnings, and a slowdown in urban consumption, has helped fuel a foreign investor equity sell-off that has pushed benchmark indices into correction territory from their September peak.\n\nGoldman Sachs last week forecast that India\u2019s economic growth would slow to 6.3 per cent in 2025 from an estimated 6.7 per cent this year. The bank\u2019s analysts highlighted a 2 percentage point fall in bank credit growth in the third quarter to 14.4 per cent, after the RBI slammed the brakes on what Das called \u201cexuberance\u201d in unsecured lending.\n\nThe governor said India\u2019s economy was \u201ca mixed picture\u201d, but added there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that RBI measures over the past year to rein in retail credit, which was ballooning at a rate exceeding 25 per cent earlier this year, were the cause of a weak urban consumption.\n\nDas, who was appointed to helm the RBI in 2018, has been broadly praised for his stewardship of India\u2019s economy and his management of the rupee, which has remained largely stable thanks to regular central bank interventions in the market.\n\nIndian media have suggested that Das\u2019s mandate is likely to be extended, which would make him the longest-serving RBI governor since the 1960s.\n\nDas\u2019s reappointment would mean \u201cpolicy loosening is not on the cards for the time being\u201d, said Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, calling the RBI governor \u201cone of the more hawkish panel members in recent months\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat all said, there is growing evidence that the economy is cooling and we still think that inflation will drop back over the coming months,\u201d Shah added. \u201cThat will open the door for policy easing to begin in April, regardless of personnel.\u201d\n\nDas declined to comment on a potential extension of his term. \u201cI have a monetary policy [meeting] coming up, I think my mind is preoccupied,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1afb3d71-53a5-4c4a-88af-ffa484cc1d6b"}}, {"id": "a224b104-19c8-4d41-a39b-70e2bfbc4226", "event_name": "French oil major TotalEnergies suspends fresh investment in Adani joint ventures", "blurb": "Indian conglomerate releases report on operations after US indictment of founder Gautam Adani for alleged bribery", "date": "2024-11-2500:00:00.0", "body": "French oil major TotalEnergies has suspended fresh investments in joint energy projects with the Adani Group and said the Indian conglomerate had not informed it of a US corruption probe even as the companies pursued deals together.\n\nUS authorities indicted the group\u2019s founder Gautam Adani in a bribery case last week.

It also raises the prospect of what could become fraught extradition proceedings.\n\nKevin Davis, professor at New York University School of Law, drew parallels with Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht, which was involved in Brazil\u2019s sprawling corruption investigation known as \u201cCar Wash\u201d and later agreed to pay the US and others multibillion-dollar penalties.\n\nIn that case, the DoJ did not pursue Odebrecht\u2019s former CEO, \u201cwhose stature in Brazil was comparable to Adani\u201d, Davis said. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting here is that the Americans are going after the individual\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but in terms of the economic and political ramifications, the proceeding is similar in scale\u201d.\n\nThe case comes just months before US president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House in January will usher in a new US attorney-general.\n\nDaniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor, said the timing of the charges may have been \u201can effort to get the nature of the charges out\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009before the change of administration\u201d.\n\nA new president \u201cmay cause those charges to be changed, withdrawn or otherwise impeded, but the allegations will still be out there and at the very least, the market and the public will have a sense of what the investigation has been about,\u201d Richman said. If the government were to drop the case, parties potentially hit by the alleged scheme could \u201cpursue their own remedies\u201d, he added.\n\nAdani earlier this month congratulated Trump on his electoral victory, pledging in a post on X to invest $10bn in US energy and infrastructure and to create up to 15,000 jobs.

Alongside their political and economic power, Roe witnessed the range and depth of the Mughals\u2019 cultural achievements, with art forms from carpetmaking to jewellery, calligraphy, painting, weaponry, fabrics and more raised to a then unparalleled level of sophistication.\n\nJahangir is one of the three Mughal rulers in focus at the V&A\u2019s The Great Mughals: Art, Architecture and Opulence, which showcases this golden age of craftsmanship and artistry with a parade of startlingly magnificent objects and pictures.\n\nJahangir\u2019s father, Akbar, began his 50-year reign in 1556 and was, by all accounts, an exemplary monarch. Islamic invaders from the north-east, the Mughals had subjugated a largely Hindu population, yet Akbar ruled with surprising religious open-mindedness. He expanded and unified his empire not only through military campaigns but also diplomacy and economic cajolery, efficient bureaucracy and conciliation of his highly diverse conquered subjects.\n\nAnd he vigorously encouraged the arts. Paintings here reflect his ambitious building programmes but we also see his imperial workshops starting to produce luxury goods, textiles and carpets using stunning precious materials. Craftsmen came from across the empire \u2014 carpet makers from central Asia, mother-of-pearl inlay masters from Gujarat \u2014 but importantly from Iran. The Persian cultural influence is significant at every turn here, and its fusion with more local traditions, especially the Hindu, created what became a distinctive Mughal style.\n\nMost important to Akbar was his House of Books \u2014 perhaps oddly, since he could neither read nor write. Yet he built a library of incredible magnificence, judging from the elaborate and intricate calligraphic art on display here, much of it in Persian (the lingua franca of the court) and drawing on the skills of Iranian masters. The painting styles of Akbar\u2019s court show similar influence, but with a distinctive twist \u2014 one illustration from an 11th-century Persian epic shows a beautiful princess welcoming her lover by letting down her long hair for him to climb up. Above in the clouds, all is swirling fantasy and romance, but below in the real world the depiction of a garden with its watering system and the ducks on a pond is powerfully realistic.\n\nIn fact we glean information about everything from clothing, jewellery and meals to tilework and building techniques from the detail in the pictures here. And the growing extent of international cultural links that mirrored the political. Portuguese traders from Goa imported gemstones along with European thinking, and Akbar invited European craftsmen to teach foreign techniques such as enamelling on gold and silver, which quickly became established in the Mughal skillset. A glorious thumb ring, of gold set with rubies and emeralds and enamelled inside, is one of the almost impossibly intricate pieces shown here.\n\nThe working of nephrite jade was another imported material skill brought to stupendous heights in the Mughal courts \u2014 an example here is a small elegant wine jug (wine was clearly important throughout this period), made of shaped jade encrusted with gold, rubies and emeralds. It is jaw-droppingly pretty, the epitome of outrageous, just-because-we-can luxury.\n\nThere was export too: a hefty circular shield on display here is covered with tiny figures, horsemen and animals among elaborate foliage and patterning (another Persian style, razm o bazm, scenes of the hunt, feasts and war) tightly worked in glittering mother-of-pearl inlay, a masterpiece of metalwork and marquetry. Its chief interest, though, is that by 1599 it had found its way to Florence, in the armoury of Ferdinando of Medici \u2014 possibly a diplomatic gift?\n\nBy the time of Akbar\u2019s son Jahangir, who had a throne designed by a jeweller from Bordeaux, details in paintings show more and more cultural imports alongside the home production: Ottoman velvets, Chinese ceramics and brocades. Even exotic animals were cultural incomers: painters faithfully depicted a rather sad-looking zebra brought by emissaries from Ethiopia, a turkey cock from North America, every feather and wobbly wattle carefully defined.\n\nThis outreach to the world grew even further in the reign of the third king featured in this show, Jahangir\u2019s son Shah Jahan. Paintings show European traders carrying a box of Japanese lacquer, an emerald from Colombia; one intriguing image of a princely garden picnic includes wine poured from a Persian ceramic ewer into Venetian goblets, with Chinese porcelain on a Japanese table, while a guest sports a robe of Chinese brocade. Yet all this cultural input is melded into what is now, by the first decades of the 17th century, a firmly established Mughal style, one that had begun to astonish the world.\n\nShah Jahan took the throne in 1628, after a brutal campaign \u2014 despite the calm and elegance of royal imagery here, successions were a bloody business, chiefly brought about by murdering one\u2019s many competing brothers and cousins. Once installed on the throne, however, he presided over Mughal cultural life at its very peak and is best remembered, of course, for creating the Taj Mahal, mausoleum and loving tribute for his favourite wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th child.\n\nThe V&A\u2019s curators give surprisingly offhand treatment to Mughal art\u2019s most famous and enduring monument. A brief video, a model, some explanation of the calligraphy on the tombs\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that\u2019s about it. The wall texts do make the point, however, that the Taj Mahal\u2019s signature design, of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones to create multicoloured flowers and leaves delicately curling and twining, gave birth to a long stylistic history in Islamic art. (Even today: look at the pillars, walls and even the central courtyard of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, opened in 2007.)\n\nDuring Jahan\u2019s 30-year reign, the Mughal court became a magnet for foreign ambassadors and potentates and visitors of all sorts, drawn by its magnificence, its riches, its lucrative market opportunities. Under his rule, the arts flourished accordingly. So how does this story end? The empire still had a long way to go, after Jahan\u2019s son Aurangzeb seized power in 1658 while Jahan was ill, and initiated another 50-year reign. (Jahan recovered, but Aurangzeb imprisoned him for the rest of his life and clung on to the throne himself.)\n\nAlthough Aurangzeb expanded the Mughal empire to its furthest extent, a long decline set in. The V&A decides to fade us out of the Golden Age with Shah Jahan, bringing their glorious exhibition to a close while the going was good, but making the point that the artists and styles of these three magnificent courts, roughly 1560-1660, had an enduring legacy for centuries afterwards, throughout the subcontinent and the whole Islamic world, and beyond.\n\nTo May 5, 2025; vam.ac.uk\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FTWeekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/28e21258-2067-4c4b-bc2d-0645336530fa"}}, {"id": "3501d484-fefb-409f-a554-9e4e25abc7e4", "event_name": "Adani scandal will rock Indian market\u2019s coming of age", "blurb": "Turbulence draws fresh attention to risks and pricey valuations of local stocks", "date": "2024-11-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, once the world\u2019s third-richest man, has had a rough week in the markets. Bribery charges filed in the US knocked more than $25bn in value off Adani Group companies on Thursday. Shareholders in its 10 listed company stocks suffered. So might the international investors who have piled into the Indian market in recent months.\n\nThe sell-off in most Adani group stocks reversed on Friday, led by shares of Adani Enterprises, the holding company. But for the wider Indian market, this week\u2019s turbulence has drawn fresh attention to the risks and pricey valuations of local stocks.\n\nJust months ago, Indian stocks had been seen as a viable replacement for Chinese equities in global investor portfolios. Shares of Adani Enterprises had been one of the top performers, more than doubling from its low last year. Over the past year, shares had gained 30 per cent up until this week when the chair of Adani Group was indicted in New York in connection with an alleged scheme to bribe Indian officials in exchange for favourable solar power contracts. Adani has denied the allegations.\n\nThose types of gains have not been unusual in the local market. The broader benchmark has been on a four-year rally, more than tripling peak to trough \u2014 a period in which Chinese equities have been on a downward trend. Foreign investors shifting funds to India amid faltering growth in China have created a sense of the market\u2019s coming of age.\n\nThat shift can be seen in the net foreign capital inflows into Indian equities over the four years to this year, which surpassed $35bn. The figure hit a new record this year. A record number of new retail investor accounts joining the market helped fuel the rally, attracted by brisk economic growth in India.\n\nThat has also meant Indian stocks are getting pricey. The Nifty benchmark index trades at nearly four times book value, more than double that of broader emerging market indices. That is even after a fall of a tenth from its September peak.\n\nOn a forward earnings basis, the index trades at 25 times earnings, a premium of more than a third to the broader MSCI All-World index. Companies such as Adani Total Gas and Adani Green Energy trade at more than 90 times trailing earnings\n\nPanic selling of Adani group stocks is likely to be shortlived, as it was in 2023 following allegations of fraud, which Adani denied, made by US short seller Hindenburg Research. Shares of Adani Enterprises more than doubled in the year following the sell off. It will be more difficult to avoid being caught up in the market weakness if international investors rethink their affection for India.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2ab7f13e-347d-4e7a-b1f3-429c161b3ca8"}}, {"id": "e2c3a89c-c41e-45de-881b-fdf3d0f01bfc", "event_name": "US indictment of Gautam Adani puts India Inc\u2019s reputation on trial", "blurb": "Alleged $265mn bribery scheme raises questions about the probity of Indian authorities and business leaders", "date": "2024-11-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Battling to win back credibility with investors after a damaging short seller attack last year, India\u2019s powerful Adani Group repeatedly flew business partners and journalists to its showpiece \u201cgreen\u201d project: a vast solar and wind farm in Khavda in the north-western state of Gujarat.\n\nNow Adani\u2019s renewable power business is itself at the heart of even more perilous allegations levelled against one of India\u2019s biggest conglomerates, a sprawling industrial powerhouse whose rise has shadowed the political ascent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for two and a half decades.\n\nUS criminal and civil charges accusing the group\u2019s founder Gautam Adani of involvement in a $265mn bribery scheme have startled Indian businesspeople and given potent ammunition to Modi\u2019s parliamentary opponents.\n\nFor international investors, they raise new questions about the probity and integrity of Indian regulators and business leaders, while casting doubts on the nation\u2019s preferred narrative of an ascending economy that offers a safe alternative to a corrupt and capricious China.\n\nThe charges from the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission could also complicate New Delhi\u2019s ties with Washington, which are already clouded by claims Indian officials were involved in attempts to kill Sikh separatists in the US and Canada.\n\nSince short seller Hindenburg Research last year accused the Adani Group of engaging in \u201cbrazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud\u201d, Modi\u2019s opponents have criticised the prime minister for what are widely seen as his close ties with billionaires including Adani.\n\nOn Thursday, many called on Indian authorities to follow the example of the US agencies and prosecute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now pretty clear and established in America that Mr Adani has broken both American law and Indian law,\u201d opposition leader Rahul Gandhi told a press conference in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cHe has been indicted in the United States and I\u2019m wondering why Mr Adani is still running around a free man in this country,\u201d said Gandhi, sitting in front of a large image of Adani and Modi sharing a laugh.\n\nA possible extradition request, legal appeals and long-running court proceedings could add an unpredictable twist to a fast-expanding but complex US-Indian diplomatic, military and trading relationship ahead of the inauguration of a new administration led by Donald Trump.\u00a0An extradition treaty between India and the US has been in force since 1999, but has only occasionally been used.\n\n\u201cThere is an arrest warrant that has been issued in the US,\u201d said Praveen Chakravarty, an official with Gandhi\u2019s Indian National Congress party. \u201cHow is that going to proceed? If the US calls for extradition, is Modi going to protect him [Adani], and on what grounds?\u201d\n\nGandhi and other opposition politicians pointed in particular at one section of the US criminal indictment. It alleges that in March Gautam Adani and his nephew Sagar Adani, executive director of the Adani Green renewables business, had \u201cmade or caused\u201d group personnel to falsely tell banks and India\u2019s two stock exchanges that it had not received notice from the US justice department of an investigation.\n\nChakravarty described the US allegation of misleading investors as a \u201cserious offence\u201d that would require action by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the stock market regulator.\n\nSebi has previously investigated the allegations made by Hindenburg and reports in the Financial Times and elsewhere alleging Adani manipulated its own shares, but has not taken any action against the group. In July, Sebi said Hindenburg Research had \u201cdeliberately sensationalised and distorted certain facts\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Mahua Moitra, another opposition MP who has been scathingly critical of Adani in parliament. \u201cLet\u2019s wait for this fraud and grand larceny to unravel.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s government spokesman and Sebi did not respond to requests for comment. The Adani Group has described the US charges as \u201cbaseless\u201d and said \u201call possible legal recourse will be sought\u201d.\n\nThe charges against Adani come at a time when India\u2019s reliability as a like-minded business and diplomatic partner for western democracies was already being questioned.\n\nCanada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said there are \u201ccredible allegations\u201d of Indian involvement in the killing of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Vancouver last year. The US last month charged an Indian \u201csenior field officer\u201d with directing a foiled plot to murder a Sikh activist in New York City.\n\nWhile India expelled Canada\u2019s diplomats and responded belligerently to Ottawa\u2019s claims of extrajudicial killing, it has been more circumspect with the US, whose officials have demanded accountability from their Indian counterparts.\n\n\u201cThus far, the United States and India have successfully compartmentalised the fallout from charges linked to India\u2019s \u2018murder-for-hire\u2019 scheme, but the charges against several high-ranking Adani executives will create a new source of tension,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\u201cGiven that the charges are being brought in the middle of a presidential transition, I suspect there are already back-channel conversations taking place to implore the incoming Trump administration to drop the DoJ and SEC cases,\u201d Vaishnav said.\n\nSome Indian businesspeople speculated that fallout from the charges in India would be limited, with Modi\u2019s government likely to seek to shield a friendly business group pursuing projects central to the prime minister\u2019s infrastructure drive from prosecution both in India and the US.\n\nOne CEO, who asked not to be identified, suggested it would be unfair to judge all corporate India by a single case.\n\n\u201cMy instinct is that it hasn\u2019t hurt brand India or the credibility of the regulator or the ethos that you can build businesses in India that stand up and thrive and survive,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nIn a post on social media site X last week, Adani congratulated Trump on his election and said his group was committed to investing $10bn in US energy and infrastructure projects and was \u201caiming to create\u201d 15,000 jobs. The post was illustrated with an AI-generated panorama showing the US and Indian flags waving over a city with a port, railway and elevated highways.\n\nIf US-India relations \u201ccan survive a murder-for-hire allegation against New Delhi, then they can certainly survive this new revelation\u201d, said Michael Kugelman, director at the South Asia Institute of The Wilson Centre, a US think-tank. \u201cPresident-elect Trump may see Adani as an ally: a fellow businessman who has praised Trump, is close to Modi, and promises to invest in the US and create jobs.\u201d\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nAdani indictment raises questions over US bank\u00a0/\u00a0From Lee Jones, Professor, Queen Mary University of London, London E1, UK", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3a285234-bada-400c-a119-9393c767181e"}}, {"id": "c33939a6-b85e-425b-8332-277d52a5e95d", "event_name": "Three Bank of America bankers in India depart over alleged client tips ", "blurb": "US bank conducting internal investigation into \u2018front running\u2019 of deals", "date": "2024-11-2100:00:00.0", "body": "Three Bank of America dealmakers in India have left amid an ongoing investigation into allegations of wrongdoing in the US financial group\u2019s Asian unit, according to three sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe bankers resigned on Thursday and their departures were tied to the investigation, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe internal investigation, which was launched earlier this year following a whistleblower complaint, is probing whether BofA and bankers in its Asian operations had tipped off certain investors of upcoming secondary offerings, allowing those investors to \u201cfront run\u201d the stock sales and profit from non-public information.\n\nAt issue were meetings the bankers held with corporate executives and hedge funds prior to stock offerings, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

Prosecutors allege that Adani \u2014 whose business rise has tracked the political ascent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2014 and several associates were part of a scheme to bribe Indian officials. The charges pose an even more serious test of credibility for India\u2019s business establishment, regulators and law enforcement. How they respond will be vital for the country\u2019s business reputation. India\u2019s investment case is based not just on its size and impressive growth but on its claim to be a safer alternative to an autocratic China.\n\nProsecutors in the Eastern District of New York allege Adani and seven other executives were part of an effort to pay or promise more than $250mn of bribes to Indian state government officials to obtain green energy supply contracts worth billions of dollars. They allege the scheme was concealed from US banks and investors from whom the businesses raised millions of dollars of capital. Adani Group said the accusations were \u201cbaseless and denied\u201d and added that it would seek \u201call possible legal recourse\u201d.\n\nNews of the charges sent share prices of Adani companies tumbling just as the group was emerging from a lengthy effort to deny the allegations made early in 2023 by Hindenburg Research, a New York short seller, and bolster confidence among lenders and investors. The Hindenburg report was itself a test for India Inc \u2014 but one which it ducked. The business and government establishment largely closed ranks around Adani Group, echoing its narrative that the short seller\u2019s report was a \u201ccalculated attack on India\u201d.\n\nThough the stock market regulator, Sebi, launched investigations, it has taken little action in response to Hindenburg\u2019s report and reporting by the Financial Times and others that alleged that Adani manipulated its own shares \u2014 which the group has vigorously denied. India did not seize the moment to debate whether its corporate governance standards and market controls were sufficiently robust for a global top-five economy which prides itself on being the world\u2019s largest democracy.\n\nThe country\u2019s political and business elite should treat seriously the accusations now emanating from US legal authorities, and ensure they are properly investigated domestically. While there may be irritation at perceived interference by overseas agencies, that is the price of tapping international investors. There are also important questions over why it is American law enforcement bodies rather than India\u2019s authorities that are pursuing this case.\n\nThe allegations, after all, go to the heart of how economic power in India is concentrated in politically-connected, family-run conglomerates \u2014 and investor concerns over \u201ccrony\u201d capitalism. Not only does Adani himself have long associations with the prime minister, who is also from Gujarat. His group, spanning ports and airports to mining and green power, is central to Modi\u2019s plans to build up India\u2019s infrastructure as the backbone of its further development. Doing so will rely on foreign investment, and investor confidence.\n\nAdvanced economies have issues with crony capitalism, too. Perhaps more than any recent predecessor, returning US president Donald Trump has surrounded himself with billionaire businesspeople competing for favour. But such models typically lead to suboptimal growth.

The charges said the executives made selective disclosures to investigators, revealing Adani\u2019s requests for bribes \u201cbut concealing their own participation\u201d.\n\nThe Azure and CDPQ executives allegedly deleted electronic messages and PowerPoint presentations, while in meetings during 2023 with the FBI and SEC they denied taking part in the Indian bribery efforts. \u201cThis strategy was designed to create the appearance that the co-conspirators were reporting misconduct rather than perpetrating misconduct.\u201d\n\nSoon after Sagar Adani was approached by the FBI last year, Gautam Adani \u201cemailed himself photographs of each page of the search warrant executed and grand jury subpoena served\u201d on his nephew, according to the criminal indictment, which alleges the tycoon concealed that information from investors and banks.\n\nProsecutors noted that the Adani Group said the conglomerate was \u201cunaware\u201d of any investigation against its chair following media reports this year that US probes against the tycoon were under way.\n\nThe group\u2019s head of corporate finance is also alleged to have sent more than a dozen emails in March 2024 to multiple investors and financial institutions stating the news was \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cmalicious\u201d.\n\nEarly on Thursday morning India time Adani Green suspended a $600mn bond issue planned for this week after news of the charges prompted a major sell-off across the conglomerate\u2019s 10 listed stocks.\n\nThe drop in Adani Group shares was \u201csimilar to the reaction\u201d following Hindenburg\u2019s damaging allegations last year, said Abhay Agarwal, founder and managing director of Mumbai-based fund manager Piper Serica Advisors. \u201cIf this impacts the group\u2019s ability to raise new capital to fund its projects it would be a huge negative.\u201d\n\nHowever, with Adani\u2019s strong backing at home and extensive control over much of India\u2019s critical infrastructure, Chakravorti at Tufts expects the billionaire \u201cto ride it out much as he did when the Hindenburg report hit\u201d even if it limits his travel outside India.\n\n\u201cWill he be extradited?

His nephew Sagar Adani, who is the executive director at a renewables company founded by Gautam Adani, is also among the defendants.\n\nUS federal prosecutors said more than $250mn in bribes were \u201coffered and promised\u201d between 2020 and 2024 to people in the Indian government as part of the scheme, which was allegedly concealed from the US banks and investors from which they raised billions of dollars.\n\nThey claimed that Gautam Adani met an Indian official to \u201cadvance\u201d the scheme.\n\nThe US attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn also charged three former employees of large Canadian pension fund CDPQ in connection with the alleged scheme, saying they obstructed an investigation into the bribes by deleting emails and agreeing to provide false information to the US government. CDPQ, which invests in infrastructure projects, is a shareholder in Adani companies.\n\nThe indictments threaten to reignite a reputational crisis for Adani Group, which has been trying to move past claims of accounting fraud and stock market manipulation made last year by US short seller Hindenburg Research. Adani has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.\n\nShares across Adani\u2019s 10 listed companies dropped on Thursday. The conglomerate\u2019s flagship Adani Enterprises closed down 22 per cent, its ports business fell 14 per cent and Adani Green Energy declined 19 per cent.\n\nUS deputy assistant attorney-general Lisa Miller said in a statement: \u201cThis indictment alleges schemes to pay over $250mn in bribes to Indian government officials. These offences were allegedly committed by senior executives and directors to obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of US investors.\u201d\n\nProsecutors further alleged that the defendants \u201cextensively documented their corrupt efforts\u201d on mobile phones, on PowerPoint presentations and in Excel spreadsheets \u201cthat summarised various options for paying and concealing bribe payments\u201d.\n\nIn a parallel civil lawsuit, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said the alleged bribes were paid in order to \u201csecure [the Indian government\u2019s] commitment to purchase energy at above-market rates that would benefit Adani Green and Azure Power\u201d, two renewable energy companies in India.\n\nAdani Green, which is building one of the largest solar plants in the world at Khavda in India\u2019s western state of Gujarat, raised more than $175mn from US investors as part of a $750mn corporate bond while the scheme was ongoing, US regulators said.\n\nGautam Adani and Sagar Adani allegedly \u201cinduced US investors to buy Adani Green bonds through an offering process that misrepresented not only that Adani Green had a robust anti-bribery compliance programme but also that the company\u2019s senior management had not and would not pay or promise to pay bribes\u201d, said Sanjay Wadhwa, acting director at the SEC\u2019s enforcement division.\n\nAccording to the regulator\u2019s complaint, Sagar Adani allegedly told Azure executives and others about \u201cincentives\u201d, or bribes, he had been proposing to \u201cmotivate\u201d state officials to agree contracts with the Indian government\u2019s arm responsible for implementing renewable energy programmes.\n\nAdani Group said in a statement that the allegations by the US Department of Justice and SEC against directors of Adani Green were \u201cbaseless and denied\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[and that] all possible legal recourse will be sought\u201d. Adani Green said it would suspend a planned $600mn bond issue.\n\nCDPQ said: \u201cCDPQ is aware of charges filed in the US against certain former employees. Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is co-operating with US authorities. In light of the pending cases, we have no further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nAzure said former directors and officers of the company referenced in the charges by US authorities had been \u201cseparated\u201d from it for more than a year. \u201cWe have been co-operating with those agencies in relation to those and other matters and we will continue to do so,\u201d it said.\n\nGautam Adani has over the past two decades built his conglomerate into one of India\u2019s most formidable industrial groups, diversifying from its core ports and trading business into mining, airports, coal and renewable power.\n\nIt has built or bid for power, port and other infrastructure projects in countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Israel, where it operates the port of Haifa.\n\nIn a post on X congratulating Donald Trump on his US election victory earlier this month, Adani said his group was \u201ccommitted to leveraging its global expertise\u201d and would invest $10bn in American energy security and infrastructure projects as part of the partnership between India and the US, with the aim of creating up to 15,000 jobs.\n\nAdani\u2019s rise in business has coincided with India\u2019s drive to harness private-sector expertise and capital to develop its infrastructure, which has accelerated during Modi\u2019s decade in power.\n\nThe Indian National Congress party\u2019s Rahul Gandhi, who became India\u2019s opposition leader after this year\u2019s general election, called for an investigation after the Hindenburg allegations and questioned Adani\u2019s record of winning government tenders, as well as his close ties with ruling politicians including Modi, who is also from Gujarat.\n\nOn Thursday the party said the US indictment \u201cvindicates\u201d its demands for a parliamentary probe.

In this short timeframe, he went from being Asia\u2019s richest man to defending the business practices at his sprawling business empire.\n\nProblems started when short seller Hindenburg Research published a damaging report in January 2023, which alleged accounting fraud and stock market manipulation. Adani Group, which Adani chairs, vigorously denied the allegations and scrambled to shore up confidence with investors and banks.\n\nBut on Wednesday, those months-long efforts came crashing down. Adani and seven other business executives were charged by federal prosecutors in New York over an alleged years-long scheme to bribe Indian officials, in exchange for favourable terms on contracts, projected to bring in more than $2bn in profit.\n\nThe allegations are vast. Prosecutors said the tycoon made the payments in exchange for billions of dollars\u2019 worth of solar power contracts \u2014 and that those payments were concealed from US banks and investors.\n\nThe kickbacks in question aren\u2019t small either. Executives allegedly paid more than $250mn in bribes between 2020 and 2024 to Indian government officials as part of the scheme.\n\nIt was already well-known that Adani had close ties to the Indian government, as well as him being a vocal supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nSeven other executives were also charged, including managers at Adani energy subsidiaries and former employees of Canadian pension fund CDPQ. This was also a family affair: Gautam\u2019s nephew, Sagar Adani, was among the defendants.\n\nAdani was already in a public relations crisis.\n\nHindenburg\u2019s report had an immediate and devastating impact. A month after it came out, Adani Group had suffered a $145bn market sell-off. Adani himself suffered a personal blow, losing the title of Asia\u2019s richest man to Indian industrialist Mukesh Ambani.\n\nYet the charges from the Eastern District of New York are just one of the legal quagmires Adani will have to face.\n\nThere\u2019s a parallel civil lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said the scheme included having the Indian government commit to buying energy at above-market rates; that benefited Adani Green and Azure Power.\n\nIn October 2014, Stephen Schwarzman reminded Blackstone investors that he had some experience in spin-offs.\n\nYears earlier, an asset management group had been separated from the private equity firm and control had been ceded to an up-and-coming bond trader. That man was Larry Fink and the new firm became known as BlackRock.\n\nSchwarzman has once again struck gold, sending a Blackstone unit out into the world to find its fortune: this time that firm is PJT Partners, which was formed a decade ago as the cast-off of the former Blackstone deal advisory group.\n\nAnd its most crucial element would be its chief executive: the former Morgan Stanley rainmaker, Paul Taubman. After a huge increase in its share price since the depths of April 2020, PJT has hit a market capitalisation of $7bn.\n\nDD\u2019s Sujeet Indap and James Fontanella-Khan have crunched the numbers in securities filings and have scooped that Taubman\u2019s stake is now worth more than $1bn. Schwarzman, who got his PJT shares in the spin-off and is still the second-largest shareholder, holds shares worth more than $900mn.\n\nPJT at the moment is a big player in some of the fiercest boardroom battles. It has a role advising Boeing, Pfizer and the debt restructuring underpinning a Dish and DirectTV tie-up. The combination of Blackstone\u2019s strength in restructuring and private funds, along with Taubman\u2019s Rolodex, has proved formidable.\n\nTaubman, for his part, takes home a small sliver of what he\u2019s really worth. His salary is a mere $1mn, and his remaining pay comes simply in long-term stock grants that only vest if PJT shares go up.\n\nTaubman bet on himself. And the wager has so far paid off magnificently, both for him and his champion, Schwarzman.\n\nTo Dom or not to Dom, that is the question\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. at least if you\u2019re a billionaire with property interests in London.\n\nBritain\u2019s colonial era \u201cnon-dom\u201d rules have allowed the wealthy to shelter their overseas income and gains from UK tax, while still living \u2014 and spending \u2014 in London (or indeed their country estates).\n\nBut this convenient arrangement will end next year, under changes announced by the new Labour government. Wealthy \u201cnon-doms\u201d with one foot in the UK must now choose whether to pony up more tax, or sharply limit their time in the country to avoid taxable status.\n\nTheir predicament has prompted a great deal of hand wringing \u2014 not least in the real estate sector \u2014 about London\u2019s luxury economy and attractiveness to overseas investors.\n\nEnter Adar and Natasha Poonawalla \u2014 whose family company, the Serum Institute of India, manufactured millions of doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and who have invested tens of millions in research and production in the UK.\n\nThey own the second most expensive home in London, bought last year for \u00a3138mn.\n\nAdar told the FT earlier this year that the tax changes risked deterring investment, and would \u201cmake people stay away\u201d from the UK. But he also mentioned that his wife, Natasha, would probably put up with the loss of the tax benefits.\n\nHowever, in the same month as that interview, it appears as if she doubled down on the UK in a more tangible way. A company controlled by Natasha bought a \u00a342mn block on Grosvenor Square \u2014 formerly the Indonesian embassy \u2014 as a redevelopment opportunity.\n\nThe deal is a corrective to the worst fears about the impact of the non-dom changes to London\u2019s super prime market.\n\nBritish politics has at least since Brexit (and arguably since the Reformation) thrown up plenty of reasons for the global wealthy to stay away. But DD wouldn\u2019t count London out any time soon.\n\nOil \u2018wildcatters\u2019 Shale barons like North Dakota governor Doug Burgum and oil magnate Harold Hamm are thrilled about Republican plans to reshape the energy sector, the FT writes.

This then gets trapped by cooler air, giving the capital some of the world\u2019s foulest air.\n\nIn India pollution measured with an Air Quality Index of 400 or higher ranks as \u201csevere\u201d. Delhi\u2019s air monitoring stations cap readings at 500, but this week the AQI reached as high as\u00a01,743, according to the IQAir app. Even a few minutes outdoors leaves you feeling ill and gasping for breath.\n\nDuring the miasma, some of Delhi\u2019s rich retreat to their houses, where air purifiers offer some respite; others decamp for the cleaner climes of Himalayan hill stations. But the poor have to put up with the poison air as with so much else.\n\nOne of the sillier rituals of winter pollution season is the political blame game that accompanies it. Critics of Narendra Modi fault his government for failing to tackle a national health emergency that shortens lives, and which a 2019 study estimated was costing India 1 per cent annually in GDP.\u00a0Supporters blame the Aam Aadmi party, which runs local governments in Delhi and Punjab where much of the stubble burning happens.\n\nEnvironmentalists believe both sides miss the point. \u201cEnforcement and implementation of policy is where the big gap lies,\u201d says Mohit Beotra, CEO of the Air Pollution Action Group. \u201cBut it\u2019s also an opportunity: if someone at the top decided this was something they could address, they could chip away at the problem.\u201d\n\nWhat Indian media primly labels the \u201cwinter haze\u201d is a collective action problem. Activists believe it will need both large-scale individual action, government leadership \u2014 and ideally cross-border co-operation too.\n\nSome of the smog now blanketing Delhi comes from the brick kilns, factories and farms of Pakistan and as far afield as Afghanistan.\u00a0The wind in south Asia tends to blow from north-west to south-east, so the pollution will also carry on eastward to Bangladesh.\n\nChina, India\u2019s geopolitical rival, has succeeded in bringing down its worst air pollution levels over the past decade. But unlike India, with its decentralised, federal democracy, China is a one-party state where orders are issued at the top. India, say environmentalists, needs a more granular and co-operative approach.\n\n\u201cOne first step would be an air pollution conclave,\u201d says Bharati Chaturvedi, founder of environmental non-profit group Chintan. Smaller steps are also within reach. Municipal governments have so far undertaken theatrical but ineffective measures such as spraying water in the air or deploying mechanical road sweepers. Instead they could work more effectively on dust control or invest in public transport.\n\nTo aid overburdened officials, business should also step up.\u00a0\u201cYou need a high-level meeting with the top corporate heads in Mumbai where you can say: \u2018What can you take responsibility for?\u2019\u201d says Chaturvedi.\n\nOne key lies in enforcement: stubble burning, for example, is a punishable offence. Thermal power plants and dust-creating businesses like brick kilns and the stone-crushing industry need to be made to comply with legislation. Officials might also focus on measures such as repairing roads to ensure vehicles do not throw up dust. Garbage should not be dumped and burnt.\n\nIn Delhi and 12 other north Indian cities, a programme targeting \u201cdispersed sources\u201d of pollution uses surveyors contracted by municipal authorities to identify sources of dust or illegal waste dumping and act. An IIT Delhi study found a 15-26 per cent reduction in PM2.5 levels, a dangerous particulate matter which penetrates the bloodstream and lungs, in areas where it was implemented.\n\nIn the past, Indian governments have shown themselves willing to shoulder big projects, such as Modi\u2019s Swachh Bharat (\u201cClean India\u201d) campaign which built more than 100mn toilets. Tackling air pollution requires a similar mission-like approach \u2014 and a big push from the top.\u00a0Delhi\u2019s suffering residents live in hope that this year\u2019s smog season could prove a tipping point.\n\njohn.reed@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nIndia\u2019s toxic smog problem has some clear solutions / From Alok Bhargava, Professor, School of Public Policy, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, US", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/99041d6c-c5a3-40ba-9234-6ec0802a86bc"}}, {"id": "678b1cdd-2080-4069-9883-4546ac1a5205", "event_name": "Gautam Adani takes on plan to redevelop Mumbai\u2019s biggest slum", "blurb": "Locals and opposition parties denounce tycoon\u2019s bid to rehouse 1mn people in crowded part of India\u2019s financial capital", "date": "2024-11-2000:00:00.0", "body": "Mohammad Shakib lives in two cramped rooms in the rubbish-strewn Mumbai slum of Dharavi along with his wife and newborn son, his parents and two brothers.\n\nBut the 32-year-old fruit merchant is dismayed at plans by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani to transform the area into a \u201cworld-class\u201d district. The scheme would result in his family\u2019s expulsion and loss of his livelihood, Shakib said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one person who will benefit,\u201d he added.\n\nShakib\u2019s anger reflects growing concern in Dharavi over Adani\u2019s redevelopment plan, which is expected to displace an estimated 700,000 of the roughly 1mn people crammed into what is one of the world\u2019s most densely populated areas.\n\nAdani, a powerful tycoon widely thought to have close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, won a contract in 2022 to remake the roughly 600-acre slum, which sits on prime real estate in India\u2019s overcrowded financial capital in the western state of Maharashtra.\n\nBut Dharavi\u2019s future has become a political flashpoint ahead of state elections this week. Opposition parties trying to wrest back control of Maharashtra from an alliance led by Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party have vowed to scrap Adani\u2019s redevelopment contract, which they allege was wrongly awarded.\n\n\u201cThis government handed over Dharavi to Adani,\u201d Rahul Gandhi, India\u2019s most prominent opposition leader, told a rally last week. Gandhi has accused Modi of enriching cronies such as Adani, whose business interests have expanded in step with the prime minister\u2019s ambitious nation-building plans.\n\n\u201cThey got airports, ports, roads, and now they are getting Dharavi,\u201d Gandhi said.\n\nAdani has denied benefiting from government favouritism, and supporters of the project say that if it proceeds successfully it can become a global model for slum redevelopment.\n\nDharavi was the \u201cmost complex\u201d part of a wider overhaul of Mumbai\u2019s strained infrastructure, said one person familiar with the government plans for the revamp, which they estimated would take seven years or more and cost Adani at least $4bn.\n\n\u201cIf a man like Adani cannot do it, then I don\u2019t think anyone can in the same model,\u201d the person said.\n\nA migrant settlement on the fringes of colonial Bombay in the late 1800s, the area has been enveloped by Mumbai\u2019s explosive growth. Today it is just a stone\u2019s throw from the Bandra Kurla Complex, a modern business district home to banks, diplomatic missions and gleaming arts and convention centres owned by Mukesh Ambani, Asia\u2019s wealthiest businessman.\n\nBut Mumbai\u2019s reinvention has hardly touched Dharavi, the famous setting for the 2008 hit film Slumdog Millionaire.\n\nResistance from residents along with bureaucratic and political inertia has for decades stymied efforts to redevelop the area, a maze of brick and corrugated-iron shacks mixed with small workshops where workers toil to recycle plastics or churn out pottery or leather products.\n\nIn 2022, a BJP-led political alliance won control of Maharashtra\u2019s government and issued a new tender to remodel Dharavi after an earlier redevelopment deal was cancelled by the previous administration.\n\nAdani\u2019s conglomerate, which also runs Mumbai\u2019s airport and distributes electricity to the city, won the tender with a $619mn offer, more than 2.5 times the next highest bid. The group has an 80 per cent stake in the project, with the remainder held by the state.\n\nSeclink Technologies, a Dubai-based consortium that initially won the cancelled 2018 tender, has challenged the new contract, alleging in the High Court of Bombay that the process \u201cunlawfully\u201d favoured Adani by raising bidders\u2019 net worth requirements and limiting consortium members.\n\nThe Maharashtra government has said no contract had been agreed with Seclink, that a new tender was ordered because the financial and economic situation had been changed by factors including the coronavirus pandemic, and that the consortium was not excluded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a type of match fixing,\u201d said Raju Korde, a lawyer who grew up in the slum and is a founding member of the Save Dharavi Movement. \u201cWas this project for the rehabilitation and redevelopment of Dharavi or was it for making Adani more prosperous?\u201d\n\nAdani Group and the state authorities have denied any wrongdoing. The conglomerate and Maharashtra\u2019s Slum Rehabilitation Authority did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdani, who worked as a teenager in Mumbai\u2019s diamond trade in the late 1970s, wrote last year that he \u201cwas mesmerised by the industrious chaos that I saw in Dharavi\u2019s alleys\u201d and was inspired by \u201cthe community\u2019s struggle for survival\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen this opportunity to renew Dharavi came calling, I seized it with both hands,\u201d he wrote, promising to provide \u201celigible residents\u201d with gas, water, electricity, sanitation, recreational facilities and a \u201cworld-class hospital\u201d.\n\nA person close to Adani said the tycoon saw Dharavi as a legacy project. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to make us a lot of money,\u201d the person said. \u201c[The area] is more tightly packed than a can of sardines\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the challenge is incredible.\u201d\n\nBut the redevelopment master plan has yet to be made public and uncertainty is mounting among Dharavi residents.\n\nThe 2022 tender states that only households able to prove residency pre-2000 will be rehoused for free in a 350 sq ft apartment in the area.\n\nMany residents with documents proving their pre-2000 residence are keen to take up Adani\u2019s promise of more spacious new housing in the area.\n\n\u201cDevelopment is good,\u201d said Sheikh Shahin Banu, a 53-year-old widow who depends on her son\u2019s wage as a leather worker and wants to stay on in Dharavi. \u201cIt\u2019s centrally located\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009all of my relatives are here.\u201d\n\nFor the majority who like Mohammad Shakib face relocation, Maharashtra\u2019s government recently approved the acquisition of nearly 400 acres of land on a salt pan and garbage dump in Mumbai\u2019s north-eastern suburbs, an area that Vinod Shetty, a human rights lawyer, said was \u201cnot habitable\u201d.\n\nThe scheme was in effect \u201cwiping the slate clean\u201d in a valuable area near the BKC business district and then \u201chanding it over to somebody who\u2019s close to the government\u201d, Shetty said.\n\nAdani\u2019s surveys to verify residents\u2019 residency have \u201cmet with a lot of hostility\u201d, said the person close to the group, who also accused some people of falsifying documents to try to show they lived there before 2000.\n\nMany in Mumbai are deeply sceptical about Adani\u2019s intentions, including Shaikh Mobinuddin, a businessman who grew up in Dharavi and owns a number of shops there.\n\n\u201cHe will make people ineligible and the land will be resold to the Mumbai free market,\u201d Mobinuddin said.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9bafa390-bf42-4689-ab20-2566f732acef"}}, {"id": "c34af361-300a-4a56-81fa-6ea45b46a59d", "event_name": "BrewDog shuts Mumbai bars in blow to India expansion plans", "blurb": "Supply problems and regulatory issues disrupt UK craft-beer maker\u2019s aim to open 100 outlets in the country", "date": "2024-11-1900:00:00.0", "body": "BrewDog, the UK\u2019s biggest craft beer brand, has closed its two flagship Mumbai bars, in a blow to its plans to scale up in the country and tap the growing number of drinkers.\n\nThe BrewDog bar in Bandra West, a suburb that is home to many Bollywood stars and is known for its liberal nightlife, as well as its bar in the office district of Lower Parel, have been closed since the summer.\n\nThe company\u2019s logos have also been taken down from the locked-up properties, according to checks by the Financial Times. BrewDog now has only two bars open in India, having first set up there in 2021.\n\nPratekk Chturvedi, a director of Aloha\u00a0International Brewpub which operates the BrewDog India franchise, told the FT that the landlords had wanted the bars to close and that the franchise operator had filed legal cases to reclaim \u201cbusiness losses that we are facing\u201d. BrewDog declined to comment.\n\nEven before the closures, BrewDog had struggled with obtaining consistent beer supplies in India\u2019s financial capital. Chturvedi, who is also chief operating officer of BrewDog India, said that the brewer had also faced issues with the department that regulates and taxes alcohol in Mumbai\u2019s home state of Maharashtra.\n\n\u201cMumbai was an extremely important market for us, it is ground zero, it is where we began,\u201d Chturvedi said. \u201cI am fairly certain that in the coming time, maybe in the next, say, three to four quarters, we will find a new location and start up in [Mumbai] again.\u201d\n\nBrewDog\u2019s Mumbai setback illustrates the difficulties faced by alcoholic drinks companies in India, even as drinking has become more acceptable in a country where it has typically been frowned upon and consumption heavily regulated.\n\nIn April, a brewery owned by Heineken\u2019s Indian business, United Breweries \u2014 which is the country\u2019s biggest beermaker and the producer of Kingfisher lager \u2014 was raided by authorities in the southern state of Karnataka.\n\nUnited Breweries\u2019 chief executive Vivek Gupta told the FT that \u201cexcessive\u201d regulatory action and the patchwork of different rules across India\u2019s states and territories, some of which prohibit the sale of alcohol, were hurting sales in a \u201cpriority market\u201d.\n\nThe closures are also a setback to BrewDog\u2019s plans for overseas expansion. Only last year, it announced plans to open 100 bars in India over the next decade.\n\nChturvedi said the Mumbai closures were only a blip in BrewDog\u2019s India plans. He added that the local franchise was operationally profitable and would focus on the country\u2019s north where it had two bars in the cities of Gurugram and Amritsar.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at aggressive expansion in the coming year\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we are looking at one opening every quarter,\u201d Chturvedi said, adding that a new bar would open in Chandigarh in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cIndia is a booming craft beer market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a very lucrative, very profitable market.\u201d\n\nJames Watt, BrewDog\u2019s founder, stepped down as chief executive in May after he was accused of overseeing a \u201ctoxic\u201d workplace culture.

In the place she calls home, and where the film is set, it opened the Mami film festival in the historic art deco Regal cinema, one of the last remaining single screens in the city.\n\nThe late October weather was oppressively warm, but it also rained that day, notching up the humidity. Evoking sweaty train rides and pouring monsoon rains, it was a fitting reflection of the atmospheric imagery in Kapadia\u2019s film.\n\n\u201cIt was super nice,\u201d recalls the writer-director from her home in Mumbai. \u201cFinally the film is back where it belongs, and I\u2019m very happy that people took very different things from it.\u201d\n\nSince Cannes, Kapadia has been travelling the world as her Malayalam-language film has become a festival darling, receiving near-unanimous critical acclaim, collecting awards and generating Oscar buzz. For Kapadia, an up-and-coming filmmaker who made her debut feature film on a shoestring budget, this level of success has come suddenly.\n\nHowever, she is no stranger to Cannes. In 2017 her short film \u201cAfternoon Clouds\u201d was included in a section for new talent, and in 2021 her hybrid docu-fiction A Night of Knowing Nothing, set amid student protests at her alma mater, appeared in the Directors\u2019 Fortnight section and won the L\u2019Oeil d\u2019or award.\n\nBut her real exposure into the limelight came only this year, as All We Imagine as Light, which was largely produced and financed in France, became the first Indian film to appear in Cannes\u2019 main competition in 30 years. Kapadia lays the blame for this dearth firmly with the festival.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t choose other Indian films,\u201d she says, mildly exasperated. \u201cWe make really good films, so that\u2019s on them\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Eeb Allay Ooo! by Prateek Vats was in the Berlin Film Festival\u2019s Panorama section in 2020 \u2014 it\u2019s a great film. Rima Das makes amazing work. Anamika Haksar\u2019s films are absolutely radical \u2014 so other festivals have been selecting Indian films regularly.\u201d\n\nAll We Imagine as Light follows two Malayali nurses from Kerala \u2014 Prabha (played by Kani Kusruti) and Anu (Divya Prabha) \u2014 who work in a Mumbai hospital and share a crammed and wind-battered flat with a pregnant cat. Prabha is tightly wound to the point of sullenness and is a stickler for morality. Her husband purportedly lives in Germany but hasn\u2019t been in touch for more than a year. The younger Anu, on the other hand, is a free spirit who secretly sexts with her boyfriend. What\u2019s more, she is Hindu and he is Muslim, something frowned upon or even restricted by law in parts of India (though not in Mumbai). She also slips pregnancy pills under the counter to women patients who have little reproductive agency. When the duo\u2019s mutual friend Parvati, a hospital cook, is forced to move because of gentrification, Anu and Prabha embark on a road trip to help her settle back into her village.\n\nThe film captures the push and pull of existential challenges in the big city and ponders questions of identity, belonging and displacement. Shot in gauzy shades of blue and ochre, Mumbai serves as a muted backdrop as Kapadia quietly ruminates on life on its peripheries.\n\nShe admits she doesn\u2019t know how to define her film, but the women at its centre epitomise the hardworking migrant labour that powers one of the world\u2019s largest metropolises. This may explain its broad appeal. \u201cI think people from big cities like New York and Paris identified with it,\u201d she says. \u201cThis thing about happenstance female friendships in such places is something that I think speaks to everybody.\u201d\n\nKapadia was interested in exploring the intergenerational friendship between the three women and wanted to dissect the question of love and desire in South Asian households. \u201cPrabha\u2019s relationship has this kind of legitimacy because she\u2019s a married woman. But Anu is in love with a boy that nobody will accept. Even though she\u2019s in love, it\u2019s [considered] illegitimate,\u201d she says.\n\nThe secondary character of Parvati grew from Kapadia\u2019s urge to portray Mumbai\u2019s gentrification. She says that moving back to the city after studying in the neighbouring city of Pune, she was shocked to see how much Mumbai had changed. \u201cThe areas I grew up in \u2014 Lower Parel and Dadar \u2014 had especially gone through a kind of violent gentrification. I felt that I needed to have a character who embodied the pain of that,\u201d she says.\n\nShe also wanted to unpick complex identity issues in multicultural Indian society. \u201cI was interested in this odd friendship between a Marathi cook [Parvati] and a Malayali nurse [Prabha], which in real life is not very common. In my utopian imagination, I wanted to say that this could be a possibility. Because I think that in India identity comes in the way of a lot of things. At least in friendship, it shouldn\u2019t be the case \u2014 that\u2019s my hope,\u201d she adds.\n\nWhile global and Indian festival audiences and critics took to the film immediately, All We Imagine as Light faced public criticism from an unlikely source. The Film Federation of India (FFI), when considering India\u2019s submission for best international feature at next year\u2019s Oscars, commented that Kapadia\u2019s film felt like \u201ca European film taking place in India\u201d. The honour was given instead to Kiran Rao\u2019s feminist dramedy Laapataa Ladies.\n\nAlthough she has cited European auteurs such as Chantal Akerman and Agn\u00e8s Varda as influences for their blending of fiction and documentary, Kapadia\u2019s sensibilities are clearly grounded in India. Her film studies curriculum was packed with the work of the masters of Indian Parallel Cinema, a movement noted for its unvarnished realism that began in the 1950s with the seminal Satyajit Ray and continued through to the 1980s with luminaries such as Mani Kaul and Shyam Benegal.\n\nKapadia was influenced by the work of Govindan Aravindan and John Abraham, who made probing films about the human psyche on frighteningly small budgets. Abraham\u2019s filmmaking style especially fascinated her. \u201cI was inspired by his technique \u2014 editing, sound design and the use of stop-motion,\u201d she says. \u201cHe packs in small moments of delight in very political films.\u201d\n\nEmulating this approach, Kapadia used a handheld DSLR camera to capture the everyday Mumbai street scenes her film opens with \u2014 workers unloading produce early in the morning, sellers sorting their wares, the throng of humanity on trains and at festival time. Shooting on tightly packed streets made her more aware of their personal space, she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a bit shy to put cameras in people\u2019s faces. I tried to be mindful and the process taught me to be not intrusive.\u201d\n\nWhat emerges on screen is the gaze of a filmmaker capable of seeing humanity in the tiniest details of her subjects, bringing together elements of Indian arthouse and the European New Wave.\n\nFor Kapadia, it was vital for her that All We Imagine as Light got a theatrical release. \u201cI hope the [success] sends a signal that films like mine are worth funding and distributing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is really important to me that the film has a life in cinemas so its journey is truly complete, unlike dumping it directly in streaming platforms.\u201d\n\n\u2018All We Imagine as Light\u2019 is in UK cinemas from November 29\n\nFind out about our latest stories first \u2014 follow FTWeekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6869b994-852f-4ea4-bbe7-652829253e90"}}, {"id": "1c2e679f-cf46-458d-9f01-cea82ab78459", "event_name": "Disney-Reliance Indian media giant says TV \u2018is not dead\u2019 following $8.5bn merger ", "blurb": "Head of newly formed Jio Star says traditional linear format is still important in the country during streaming era ", "date": "2024-11-1400:00:00.0", "body": "The head of Disney and Reliance Industries\u2019 newly merged $8.5bn Indian entertainment titan plans to invest and \u201crevitalise\u201d television in the world\u2019s most populous country even as western media organisations increasingly see it as a dying medium.\n\nUday Shankar, vice-chair of Jio Star \u2014 the freshly formed company whose merger was completed on Thursday \u2014 said traditional television revenue could experience \u201csignificant double-digit growth within the next several years\u201d on the back of fresh investment in innovative content ranging from dramas to soaps.\n\n\u201cThere is this whole narrative that television is dead and it\u2019s all about streaming,\u201d Shankar told the Financial Times in Mumbai in his first interview since the combination was approved by India\u2019s regulators. \u201cTelevision in this country for sure is not dead.\u201d\n\nWhile lagging growth in online streaming, Shankar pointed to a still robust linear pay-TV industry as more Indians steadily join the middle class.\n\nEY predicts TV revenue in India, from subscribers and advertising, will increase by 10 per cent to $9bn in the three years through to 2026, while TV ownership will climb at a similar pace to reach 202mn sets.\n\n\u201cA large number of people are coming into the economic mainstream every year,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cOne of the aspirational items of consumption that they acquire, or they want to acquire, is a TV.\u201d\n\nShankar\u2019s comments came as he outlined his plans after Disney and Reliance, the conglomerate run by Asia\u2019s wealthiest man Mukesh Ambani that spans petrochemicals, retail and telecoms, agreed earlier this year to combine their Indian entertainment assets.\n\nThe combined entity has more than 100 television stations and more than 50mn streaming subscribers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a monster merger\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there is no competition,\u201d said Shankar, a media industry veteran who will run the company, which is chaired by Ambani\u2019s wife, Nita. \u201cWe have to reinvent the market and make it much bigger.\u201d\n\nThe joint venture came together earlier this year after Disney battled to gain traction in India\u2019s huge cricket and film markets, which have both tempted and thwarted global media majors who have struggled with highly cost-conscious audiences and fierce local competition.\n\nAfter Disney acquired Star India in 2019 from Fox, the business became a financial drag. Internal debate swirled on whether to exit the country entirely, particularly after Ambani\u2019s Reliance won the streaming rights to the wildly popular Indian Premier League short-format cricket tournament.\n\nThe new Jio Star, formed from these lossmaking media businesses, aims to hit profitability within five years. Investment bank Jefferies has compared its control over Indian sports rights to that of ESPN in the US and Sky Sports in the UK.\n\nThe media group, which has a roughly 35 per cent market share in TV, won over competition authorities after promising to shed a handful of regional TV channels and not bundle advertisements across its cricket portfolio or to raise rates exponentially.\n\nShankar said that \u201cdominance in sports is highly overrated\u201d and criticism of Disney and Reliance\u2019s hold was \u201csomewhat uninformed because sports rights in this country are awarded to you for a frighteningly short period of time \u2014 it\u2019s anything from three to five years\u201d.\n\nOther Indian media houses have also attempted to downplay the industry impact of the merger.\n\nPunit Goenka, chief executive of Zee Entertainment, whose long-planned tie-up with Sony would have created a $10bn rival to Jio Star before it acrimoniously collapsed earlier this year, said he did not expect to see much change after competing with the duo previously as independent companies.\n\n\u201cTheir entire strategy is sports-focused whereas our strategy is completely entertainment-focused and, therefore, I do not think that we are really competing in that space or that segment,\u201d he said on an earnings call last month.\n\n\u201cThey may have a little bit more leverage on the advertising dollars that they can command given that they may have a significantly higher market share.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fe860e58-5412-469e-9444-5a79627e908e"}}, {"id": "d22ac384-9113-41fd-a8c5-8cd3fb5e624a", "event_name": "The eerie quietness of India\u2019s new financial hotspot ", "blurb": "Narendra Modi\u2019s GIFT City has already lured JPMorgan and HSBC but the social side has been slow to catch up", "date": "2024-11-1400:00:00.0", "body": "Standing on his office balcony in India\u2019s searing afternoon heat, veteran civil servant K Rajaraman gestures across a panoramic sweep of cranes.

International interest, he says, is \u201cproof of the pudding\u201d that it will be a success. The number of organisations flocking to the city \u2014 a long-standing pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and created in his home state \u2014 already exceeds 700.\n\nThis is even more impressive given GIFT City\u2019s location in one of India\u2019s few dry states. It is a world away from the choked up chaos and energetic drive of cosmopolitan financial capital Mumbai, with its beery taprooms and fine dining.\n\nGujarat, which juts out into the sea in north-west India, is not on most tourist to-do lists \u2014 though it contains a national park in the south that is the last known natural habitat of the Asiatic lion. The state is largely a vast, alluvial plain with some low mountains. It is considered conservative and business focused.\n\nFittingly, GIFT city, which sits on the banks of the Sabarmati River in a flat and dusty landscape, offers something more pragmatic than Mumbai\u2019s buzzing nightlife. As a special economic zone, it avoids India\u2019s onerous red tape and strict capital controls, while granting 100 per cent tax exemptions over 10 of 15 years. Those sweeteners have lured businesses from JPMorgan to HSBC as well as Australian universities, insurance houses, ship leasers and local tech titans Infosys and Wipro.\n\nAlready, it is rising up the Global Financial Centres Index, which ranks competitiveness in over hundred hubs, from 92 three years ago to 52. That places it ahead of Mumbai.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Modi\u2019s baby and allows his administration to say they are opening up,\u201d said one western diplomat who has visited. Still, they pointed out that some foreign businesses were shying away because the city is in \u201cthe middle of nowhere\u201d. \u201cAre top investment bankers going to relocate there with limited nightlife and a few mid-range hotels?\u201d they added.\n\nAlthough more than 20,000 employees already work here, the area remains eerily quiet. Well paved roads carry little traffic. Entertainment options have been slow to arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s a chicken and egg situation,\u201d said an executive who has set up a new office in the city. He estimates it will take at least five years for the city\u2019s social element to liven up.\n\nThere have already been some compromises over Gujarat\u2019s prohibitive laws. Late last year the state government published guidelines that in theory allow the sale of alcohol in parts of the city. However this message has not reached everyone. The staff at one hotel with a supposed liquor licence looked puzzled by my thirsty enquiries.\n\nA fund manager preparing to set up shop here compares the district\u2019s early days to those of Dubai, another arid and previously alcohol-free financial hotspot. \u201cDubai initially was not very open to that,\u201d they said, acknowledging that good staffing would remain a \u201cchallenge\u201d. \u201cWe have a massive operation in Mumbai, so there\u2019s going to be a ton of support out of there initially.\u201d\n\nThe long-term political viability of GIFT City has also come into question after a weakened Modi returned to power following a worse than expected electoral showing earlier in the year. Now beholden to coalition parties during his third term, some observers wonder if the project will survive should India\u2019s opposition eventually come back to power.\n\nRajaraman brushes aside such concerns, calling the economic transformation across the country \u201cunstoppable\u201d and the new city\u2019s growth a key part of that drive. No matter who has been in power, he says, \u201cthe Indian reform story has been continuous for decades\u201d.\n\nchris.kay@ft.com", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8ffa96f6-3f98-4d4d-a68a-805875268626"}}, {"id": "a6f7e910-49e7-427e-8015-9540c74f3e17", "event_name": "Caste remains off-limits in corporate India\u2019s drive for diversity", "blurb": "The push to remedy workplace inequalities does not extend to the country\u2019s ancient system of hierarchy", "date": "2024-11-1400:00:00.0", "body": "Browse the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) web pages of corporate India and you may notice the frequent absence of one word: \u201ccaste\u201d.\n\n\u201cGender\u201d, \u201csexuality\u201d, \u201cphysical ability\u201d and \u201crace\u201d all get regular mentions on these public-facing sites, but \u201ccaste\u201d \u2014 which negatively affects the lives of hundreds of millions of Indians \u2014 is usually missing.\n\nOccasionally, the term can be found in downloadable documents, such as a company\u2019s code of conduct.

India banned caste-based discrimination when it wrote its new constitution after independence in 1947 and it reserves 50 per cent of government jobs and university places for marginalised groups.\n\nBut these quotas are contentious and breed resentment among those who feel they cannot land coveted government jobs as a result. \u201cIt\u2019s why our officials are so inefficient,\u201d the boss of a chartered accountancy company told the FT recently.\n\nWith these measures failing to bring about equality or the demise of caste, many have placed their hopes in economic growth and modernisation. Yet, increasingly, this appears to have been a false hope and caste is now the lens through which many are viewing economic inequality.\n\n\u201cAn undeniably unique feature of economic inequalities in India is that they are closely intertwined with the deeply rooted caste system,\u201d say economists including Thomas Piketty in a recent report for the World Inequality Lab (WIL), a Paris-based research organisation.\n\nIndeed, it is such a feature that, this month, the south Indian state of Telangana became the third to hold a caste census, to establish which communities are being left behind.\n\nIndia\u2019s opposition parties are also calling for a national caste census \u2014 to which the ruling Bharatiya Janata party may have to agree, given that low-caste Indians make up the majority of the population.\n\nCaste was first laid out in Hindu scripture 3,000 years ago and has evolved into a hierarchy of four levels: Brahmins, or priests, at the top; followed by rulers and warriors; then merchants and labourers; and, below all, the Dalits, or untouchables.\n\nPriests and warriors, together, are referred to as the upper castes and they own about 55 per cent of the country\u2019s wealth, according to the WIL. They are thought to account for about 20 per cent of the population, but no one knows for sure because the last caste census was in 1931.\n\nDalits account for about 16 per cent of the population, or 220mn people, and can still face exclusion or even violence because of their caste, especially in rural areas. Labourers \u2014 who can also face discrimination \u2014 account for about 50 per cent, or 700mn people.\n\nCaste is not as strictly enforced in cities, but it still plays a role in almost all social and economic relationships.\n\n\u201cPeople in companies like to say they are caste blind but, in reality, caste is everywhere,\u201d says Meenakshi, a DEI expert with the Chennai-based human resources consultancy Kelp who prefers not to give a surname because of its privileged caste associations.\n\nMany people still get asked their caste in job interviews and some Brahmin groups organise Brahmin-only job fairs.\n\nOne CEO of an investment firm recently told the FT that he did not feel bad about the caste imbalance at his firm because \u201cDalits have the quota system for their jobs\u201d. He added that his company has a corporate social responsibility policy that assists marginalised communities through charity.\n\nDEI principles finally arrived in India via multinational companies a few years ago, and have taken off both as corporate policy and as a public relations tactic.\n\nHowever, Meenakshi says its provenance meant it came with priorities dictated by the west: it gave huge importance to issues such as women and race, but largely skipped over the issue of caste.\n\nMany Indian companies have stuck with this template, but Meenakshi, Dhanuja and others want to \u201cIndianise\u201d the model so it incorporates caste at a high level.\n\nThis, they argue, will be good for the companies involved, unlocking wider pools of talent and a greater diversity of views. They point to various studies by McKinsey, the management consultancy, showing that the more racially and gender diverse company is, the better it performs.\n\nSimilarly, in 2019, the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore released a paper showing that, when two companies dominated by different castes merge or acquire one another, they generate more market value then when two companies dominated by the same caste unite. However, the paper also noted that most companies prefer to merge with or buy entities with the same caste profile.\n\nThis search for sameness affects Indian companies\u2019 hiring, too. In 2012, Canadian researchers found that 91 per cent of board directors in India\u2019s top 1,000 companies came from the top two castes.\n\nAnd a study by Jawaharlal Nehru University, in that same year, showed that candidates with high-caste Hindu names were 60 per cent more likely to be called for interview than people with low-caste names if otherwise identical CVs were submitted.\n\nStatistics on the exact make-up of organisations today are impossible to find because very few companies keep records on caste. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that lower castes are vastly unrepresented in well-paid jobs.\n\n\u201cIn an office of one hundred, you might not find a single Dalit,\u201d says Vaibhav Wankede, a marketing executive from Mumbai who has written about the difficulties of being lower caste in white collar workplaces.\n\nHe says that Dalits often feel they need to mask their identity at work. \u201cIt\u2019s everything from the food we eat, to the holidays we celebrate \u2014 all of that is a marker of who we are and a potential reason for exclusion,\u201d Wankede explains, adding that \u201cmost Dalits just try to keep their heads down and get on with the work.\u201d\n\nTo address the issue, Dhanuja suggests starting with something small like a survey, and then building up to in-person awareness sessions where the impact of caste is discussed.\n\nBut she says the way managers ultimately decide to bring caste into their DEI polices depends on the industry, the composition of their current staff, and what goals they set.\n\nMeenakshi advocates a similar approach, focusing on teaching people what casteism looks like, and rethinking hiring practices so companies spot candidates who have skills they really need.\n\n\u201cAll too often, the definition of merit is shaped by the skills upper-caste candidates tend to have: good spoken English, social confidence,\u201d Meenakshi cautions \u2014 adding that companies should not discount the tenacity and hard work it takes for a lower-caste candidate to get to the same interview as higher-caste candidates.\n\nLastly, Dhanuja says companies should consider putting out caste-positive jobs ads, explicitly stating that roles are open to people of Dalit or other marginalised backgrounds.\n\nShe would, she says, go further and set targets for lower-caste hires, but she knows from quotas in the state sector that this can easily fail if HR managers are unsupportive.\n\nFor companies that think this all sounds too much like hard work, Dhanuja points out that caste awareness is on the rise and failure to adapt is risky. \u201cIf a company doesn\u2019t want to do anything about it, they are just exposing themselves to law suits and reputational damage,\u201d she warns.\n\nBut Pratap Tambe \u2014 a manager at Tata Consultancy Services and a frequent speaker on caste \u2014 is less convinced. He warns that any sudden shifts could result in a \u201cbacklash from negatively impacted interests\u201d and a \u201chigh risk\u201d of false discrimination allegations.\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nLoans drive progress in India\u2019s caste system\u00a0/\u00a0From Sunil Choudhary and Gil Yaron", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b0a7eb5e-2f03-4855-81ea-3d8fd07e4b26"}}, {"id": "68df7081-a0ef-451d-af20-42ef7815f1d0", "event_name": "The Imaginary Institution of India: Art 1975-1998 \u2014 Barbican exhibition review", "blurb": "A London show reveals how artists responded to the crumbling of post-independence ideals", "date": "2024-11-1300:00:00.0", "body": "In \u201cDream Houses\u201d, a 1969 film by Nalini Malani, the promise of social housing in newly independent India is conjured through a stop-motion animation of an architectural model in iridescent colours. But seven years later, in Malani\u2019s dual-channel video installation \u201cUtopia\u201d, its pulsing optimism is undercut by black-and-white footage of a woman in a high-rise gazing down at condemned shacks. The ironic juxtaposition reflects the crushing disillusionment triggered in 1975 by prime minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s state of emergency.\n\nAlongside a programme of forced sterilisation to target population growth, Malani tells me in London, the prime minister\u2019s son, Sanjay Gandhi, moved to \u201caestheticise the city and remove all the slums\u201d. One where she was filming in Mumbai was razed overnight. For artists such as Malani, this trampling of civil liberties crystallised the shocking collapse of Nehruvian democratic ideals since independence.\n\nThe emergency of 1975-77 is the starting point for The Imaginary Institution of India: Art 1975-1998, a cogent and compelling group exhibition at the Barbican Gallery in London, in collaboration with the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art in New Delhi. This private museum loaned more than half of the 150 works by 30 artists in a show focused on a seminal period that has disturbing echoes today. A parallel film season, Rewriting the Rules: Pioneering Indian Cinema after 1970, runs to December 12.\n\nAlthough 1947, and the generational trauma of partition, tend to be seen as paramount, says Shanay Jhaveri, the show\u2019s curator and Barbican head of visual arts, the emergency was a watershed. As artists confronted the post-independence realities of India\u2019s failing infrastructure, population explosion, poverty and unrest, he tells me, \u201cutopian ideals dissipated; art history gets entwined with social history.\u201d\n\nFear of repression pervades the desolate streets in Gulammohammed Sheikh\u2019s oil painting \u201cSpeechless City\u201d (1975), deserted but for marauding animals against a blood-orange background. Sheikh, who had studied in London, was among figurative painters who drew on Indian miniatures for their urban narratives. Others turned to satire and caricature, from Vivan Sundaram\u2019s scabrous pastel and ink work of Gandhi and son as grotesque gangsters, \u201cThe Pair\u201d (1976), to Rameshwar Broota\u2019s brilliantly economical oil painting on corrupt power, \u201cReconstruction\u201d (1977), in which an arrogantly enthroned general intimidates the faceless minions around him.\n\nObserving the widening gap between vaunted progress and those left behind, artists were drawn to the forgotten. In Sudhir Patwardhan\u2019s oil painting \u201cDhakka\u201d (1977), a muscular labourer\u2019s back fills the canvas as he bends wearily to pick up his clothes, while in the craggy landscape of beggars and dejected workers in \u201cOverbridge\u201d (1981), the sumptuous blue of a man\u2019s shirt forces the viewer\u2019s gaze to his haunted face.\n\nLike Patwardhan, Gieve Patel earned his living as a doctor in Mumbai, before commercial galleries opened in India. \u201cOff Lamington Road\u201d (1982-86) fixes in pastel colours the gamut of ecstasy and desperation he witnessed. In an alley crowded with goats and scooters, a man collapses. A woman lies bleeding. Others dance joyously amid the destitute. In the show\u2019s opening oil painting, the chatting workers in Patel\u2019s \u201cTwo Men With Hand Cart\u201d (1979) are overshadowed by skyscrapers. Yet the pop-art pink of a monsoon sunset bathes the work in ebullient beauty and hope.\n\nIn bleak contrast are Savindra Sawarkar\u2019s etchings of Dalit pariahs weighed down by the pots and brooms marking their so-called untouchability, and Pablo Bartholomew\u2019s 1984 photographs of the aftermath of the Union Carbide gas disaster in Bhopal. In an unforgettable close-up, a father\u2019s disembodied hand reaches towards a child\u2019s face protruding, with sightlessly open eyes, from the dirt.\n\nThe link between art and activism becomes explicit in staged photography. Sheba Chhachhi\u2019s black-and-white series Seven Lives and a Dream (1980-91) combines documentary images of anti-dowry demonstrations with staged portraits of women activists. Sunil Gupta\u2019s Exiles (1987) pictures gay men at public monuments, such as a couple embracing at India Gate. Although homosexuality was decriminalised in 2018, the artist notes in the catalogue, the law \u201cstill only allow[s] gay sex in private\u201d. Bhupen Khakhar skewers such absurdities in his oil painting \u201cTwo Men in Benares\u201d (1982), in which a naked gay couple, penises erect, embrace furtively in the shadows while, in a distant temple, a holy man prostrates himself before a shiva lingam \u2014 a sacred phallus.\n\nWhile the fast-expanding metropolis inspired art, urban artists \u2014\u00a0many of them privileged \u2014\u00a0championed rural and Adivasi (indigenous) art. Jyoti Bhatt\u2019s photography documented disappearing traditions, while others gave ancient arts a contemporary edge, whether Meera Mukherjee\u2019s beguiling, small-scale lost-wax bronze sculptures, or Himmat Shah\u2019s modernist-inflected terracotta heads. Not only do Jagdish Swaminathan\u2019s abstract canvases meld colour-field painting with tribal motifs, but as founding director of the Bharat Bhavan arts complex in Bhopal in 1982, he showed Adivasi art alongside that of contemporary artists \u2014 a radical approach he termed \u201ccontemporaneity\u201d.\n\nThe largely wall-based works give way to installations in the 1990s, as the dual rise of communalism and consumerism transfigured art. MF Husain\u2019s acrylic painting \u201cSafdar Hashmi\u201d (1989), depicting a murdered playwright with twisted limbs, is a harbinger of violence to come. Arpita Singh\u2019s oil painting \u201cMy Mother\u201d (1993) captures the riots that swept the country after the Ayodhya mosque was razed by a Hindu mob in 1992; its woman in white frowns amid the shrouded bodies lined up on the ground as green-uniformed militiamen wreak havoc. In the saturated, dreamlike colour of Sheikh\u2019s oil painting \u201cHow Can You Sleep Tonight?\u201d (1994-95), a couple lying awake in the moonlight embody a restless call to conscience.\n\nA host of artists responded to turbulent times by abandoning figurative painting altogether. Rummana Hussain\u2019s shattered terracotta pots, from which red powder spills like blood, are a visceral response to the carnage she fled in Mumbai, while Sheela Gowda\u2019s cow dung sculptures, from patties to bricks, resonate with the cow\u2019s associations to women\u2019s work and non-violence. The material clashes with the spiritual in NN Rimzon\u2019s \u201cThe Tools\u201d (1993), whose fibreglass figure with arms raised in devotion stands in a ring of rusting agricultural implements that could become cudgels. Home ceases to be a refuge in \u201cHouse\u201d (1994), an installation by the erstwhile caricaturist Sundaram, in which a fire blazes on a video at the heart of a cuboid shack, while saws and hammers are embedded in the walls outside, along with hacked-off limbs.\n\nMalani\u2019s video installation, \u201cRemembering Toba Tek Singh\u201d (1998), responds to the show\u2019s final event: the underground nuclear tests in Pokhran, Rajasthan, that were variously met with national pride and protests. Twelve monitors in refugees\u2019 tin trunks play archival footage of Partition, of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other nuclear explosions and refugee flows, while a video triptych stages a dialogue between India and Pakistan through two women actors fearful of a dawning nuclear age.\n\nIf Malani\u2019s feat of memory charts how far the country had strayed from its founding ideals half a century after independence, this fine show attests to the inspired range, and formal inventiveness, of the artistic response.\n\nTo January 5 2025, barbican.org.uk", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3d6d731b-1558-4e8d-ba35-4764e54d7d9d"}}, {"id": "8b24e715-bd5e-44b9-b9bc-e44988e436e7", "event_name": "India\u2019s hunger for fossil fuels drags on its push towards net zero ", "blurb": "Growing economy sucks up more electricity than its green sources can provide despite billions invested in solar and wind farms", "date": "2024-11-1100:00:00.0", "body": "The decades-old coal-fired Trombay power plant stands on Mumbai\u2019s eastern waterfront, shrouded in smoggy haze and flanked by oil refineries. The facility \u2014 a potent symbol of an enduring reliance on polluting energy \u2014 fuels the skyscrapers and homes of India\u2019s financial capital.\n\nIndia\u2019s energy-hungry economy is sucking up more electricity than its green sources can provide, despite the billions of dollars invested in solar and wind farms by conglomerates such as Adani Group and Tata Sons, whose energy arm Tata Power operates the Trombay plant.\n\nThat means the world\u2019s third-largest carbon emitter, after the US and China, remains wedded to its abundant coal power for more than 70 per cent of its electricity generation.\n\nAt the same time, the country is being ravaged by weather extremes from the world\u2019s changing climate. Punishing heatwaves, for example, have prompted better off citizens to invest in air conditioners, exacerbating the problem.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s situation is actually highlighting the complexity of energy transition,\u201d says Nandini Das, a climate and energy economist at Climate Analytics, a research institute. \u201cIndia still has a very deep focus on coal.\u201d\n\nThe problem is acute for the country as it industrialises its economy, subsidising both carbon-heavy businesses and renewable sectors to promote their growth, in a bid to become a manufacturing hub that can steal market share from its Asian rival, China.\n\nOver the past three years, this has helped to turn solar and wind energy into its cheapest form of electricity.\n\nThe switch came about after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set out plans to reach net zero by 2070 and his administration began pushing to make renewable sources half the energy mix by 2030.\n\n\u201cCurrently, electricity from large renewable energy plants is much cheaper than new coal-based power plants, making it a win-win for both [the] climate and the economy,\u201d says Nandikesh Sivalingam, director at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a research organisation.\n\nHowever, India\u2019s increasing use of coal to make up for shortfalls in electricity drove production and imports to a record in the first half of 2024, and is a \u201cdrag\u201d on its green ambitions, according to scientific group Climate Action Tracker. It rates the nation\u2019s climate targets and climate action as \u201chighly insufficient\u201d.\n\nIndia\u2019s share of global greenhouse gas emissions increased to 7.5 per cent in 2022, from 6.7 per cent in 2019, according to rating agency Moody\u2019s, which now forecasts that power consumption will rise 46 per cent to 2,524 terawatt hours by 2031.\n\nThe agency also estimates that India will need extra funding of up to $215bn over the next seven years to bridge its renewable financing gap so that it can install around 44 gigawatts each year to hit its target of 500GW of green energy.\n\nChristian de Guzman, senior vice-president at Moody\u2019s, says that, while India\u2019s progress has been \u201ctangible and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009frankly, quite impressive given the pace of growth in this economy, they\u2019re not investing enough basically to meet their medium-term decarbonisation goals\u201d.\n\nModi\u2019s government, which faces multiple spending demands, cannot be expected to \u201cfully plug\u201d that amount, de Guzman adds.\n\nIndia\u2019s green transition is also clashing with political and economic realities. Only about 2 per cent of passenger vehicles sold in India are battery-powered. They are more expensive than combustion-engine vehicles and their charging and battery-swapping infrastructure is limited, hindering the industry\u2019s growth in a country where GDP per capital is less than $3,000.\n\nAt the same time, India faces an employment crisis with a chronic shortage of formal jobs, raising questions about how it will provide work for millions, as well as support farmers. Agriculture accounts for about 22 per cent of India\u2019s emissions, which is double the world average, with livestock\u2019s methane emissions and dairy making significant contributions, Moody\u2019s says.\n\n\u201cThe agenda of decarbonisation should not end up costing us,\u201d argues Amir Bazaz, head of infrastructure and climate at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements.\n\nStill, the world\u2019s most populous nation faces pressure from abroad and Indian officials bristle when questioned on their climate commitments. They say developed nations are responsible for historical emissions and countries such as India are morally right to use whatever energy source is readily available so they can catch up economically.\n\nFinance minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently denounced the EU\u2019s planned carbon tax on imports, which will be levied from 2026, as \u201cstifling\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe keep reminding ourselves in India that the emissions per capita is only a third of what the average emission per capita is globally,\u201d she told the Financial Times\u2019 Energy Transition Summit India in New Delhi in October.\n\nBut Das at Climate Analytics calls that mindset \u201cvery naive\u201d, given India\u2019s extreme climate vulnerability, as evidenced by increasing flooding and brutal temperatures.\n\nIn August, however, PM Prasad, chair of state-owned Coal India, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the country\u2019s output, said his \u201cvision is to ensure that there is no shortage of coal\u201d and that \u201cdespite the country\u2019s deep commitment to renewable energy, for climate change considerations, coal [will] continue to be pivotal for [a] few more years\u201d.\n\nWith power cuts disrupting even India\u2019s most affluent cities, Modi\u2019s government is on board with that future, too. It has drawn out the lifespan of ageing thermal plants and wants to open 100 new coal mines with a production capacity of 500mn tonnes per annum by 2030 \u2014 to achieve Aatmanirbhar Bharat, or \u2018a self-reliant India\u2019, in fossil-fuel power generation.\n\n\u201cWe are going to add more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; it\u2019s us who are going to be impacted,\u201d says Das. \u201cIt\u2019s not that by doing this we are giving [developed nations] some lesson, saying \u2018now it\u2019s our turn\u2019. It\u2019s not going to work that way.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0b494df4-db57-4d0e-b1e5-ce1a05c98034"}}, {"id": "dd49ae78-746e-4070-ab52-d3107bd05e56", "event_name": "Can India reverse its manufacturing failure?", "blurb": "The industrial boom in the southern state of Tamil Nadu offers a model for the rest of the country to emulate", "date": "2024-11-1000:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is senior fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics, former chief economic adviser to the Indian government and adviser to the government of Tamil Nadu\n\nIndia\u2019s rise as a major economy has long been held back by its failure to develop a robust manufacturing sector. The share of manufacturing in GDP has remained stubbornly low, even declining over the past decade despite the government\u2019s enormous subsidy programme to encourage companies to \u201cMake in India\u201d. Can this failure be reversed, given the opportunity created by the stampede of capital away from China?\n\nThere are glimmers of hope. One state in southern India \u2014 Tamil Nadu \u2014 is experiencing a manufacturing boom, attracting the likes of Cisco, Corning, Foxconn, Ford, Google, Tata Electronics and Tata Jaguar Land Rover, and Nike suppliers. These investments are integrating India into global supply chains for electronics, automotives and footwear. What is the secret to its success?\n\nThere\u2019s scope. The state\u2019s manufacturing investments encompass a much wider range than elsewhere in India, notably including labour-intensive activities. This is puzzling, since Tamil Nadu is among the richest states in the country. So how can it attract labour-intensive manufacturing while much poorer states cannot? Essentially, because factories have been willing to tap pools of lower-wage workers, such as migrants from other Indian states and women. In fact, 40 per cent of all women employed in factories in India are in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThen there\u2019s scale. Several of the new projects will provide employment in the tens of thousands. This is astonishing in a country where the median company in labour-intensive industries employs just 21 workers, making it too small to be globally competitive.\n\nTamil Nadu \u2014 unlike India more generally \u2014 has also created the perception that it is a relatively easy place to do business. The state has long had a well-developed educational system, churning out hundreds of thousands of engineering graduates every year. This had made it the country\u2019s manufacturing powerhouse, especially in automobiles and auto parts, which attracted considerable FDI in the boom years of the noughties. In addition, it offers generous incentives to investors.\n\nBut such incentives are available throughout India. The state\u2019s talented engineers could be employed elsewhere. In Tamil Nadu, however, the state government has also grasped the critical importance of minimising risks to investors.\u00a0There is a political consensus that once investors set up shop, they should not be subject to policy reversals, neglect, or discrimination.\n\nTwo examples are illustrative. In 2021, a food poisoning incident at an electronics plant seemed poised to become a full-scale political incident. The government swung into action, working with both capital and labour. It helped the victims speedily, thereby ensuring minimal operational disruption for the employer, and ensured that safety standards were upgraded.\n\nAlso in 2021, Ford announced it needed to shut production in the state. The Tamil Nadu government recognised market realities and helped Ford exit by resolving complex labour and land issues. That experience convinced Ford that risks of doing business there were low. So when the company decided this year to make a new investment in India, it again chose the southern state. The concept that easy exits incentivise enthusiastic entry has not been easy for Indian policymakers to grasp.\n\nIf India is to develop its manufacturing sector, this Tamil Nadu experience must be replicated in the poorer, populous heartland states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, with their cheaper labour pools. To be sure, the governance challenges will be immense and India\u2019s geopolitical window will not remain open forever. But the model is there for emulation.\n\nJosh Felman of Principal JH Consulting contributed to this article", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fc56385d-ceed-4dee-9e5e-017a708d37c9"}}, {"id": "d12218a3-cf6a-4b08-8bdb-4ebd4e138655", "event_name": "Indian investors lukewarm over Swiggy\u2019s $1.3bn listing", "blurb": "The food delivery app\u2019s IPO has landed during a backdrop of dismal earnings across the corporate subcontinent", "date": "2024-11-1000:00:00.0", "body": "Trading in Indian food delivery app Swiggy begins on Wednesday in a $1.3bn initial public offering that investors have already given a lukewarm reception, as it tries to grow in a fiercely competitive sector.\n\nOn Friday, institutional investors shored up Swiggy\u2019s listing on its final subscription day as the Bengaluru-based company chased a valuation of about $11.2bn.\n\nSwiggy\u2019s listing \u2014 India\u2019s second-largest this year \u2014 received bids more than three times the shares on offer, with the retail portion just covered.\n\nIt is one of a glut of Indian companies that rushed to list and capitalise on elevated valuations this year as the country\u2019s stock market soared.\n\nBut Swiggy\u2019s IPO, with early backers including Tencent and venture capital fund Accel cashing out, has landed against a backdrop of dismal earnings across corporate India.

That business accounts for 40 per cent of the app\u2019s food delivery sales and Swiggy has built out more than 500 local warehouses known as dark stores to enable a fast churn of small-volume orders in a tight radius.\n\nSome analysts and local fund managers had warned that despite a surge in domestic investment among households, the IPO boom that saw India become the world\u2019s largest listing market outside the US would struggle to be sustained by local bidders.\n\n\u201cThere is concern about the IPO market\u201d, said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, the Singapore-based head of consumer and internet at Aletheia Capital, an advisory group focused on Asia.\n\nConsumer goods companies in India are struggling with weakening demand in the country\u2019s cities as stubborn inflation and a retail credit crackdown by the central bank hits the spending power of middle-class Indians.\n\nAt a press conference last month, Swiggy\u2019s chief executive Sriharsha Majety dismissed signs of consumer strife. \u201cAt this point we have not been seeing that, the businesses have been demonstrating strong growth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Indian delivery sector has seen several high-profile casualties in recent years, such as Uber Eats and local courier app Dunzo. The latter collapsed this year despite backing from Reliance Industries, the Indian conglomerate owned by Mukesh Ambani, Asia\u2019s richest man.\n\nSwiggy has \u201clagged\u201d Zomato, which went public in 2021, in both food delivery and quick commerce, according to Axis Capital. In response, Swiggy has earmarked about Rs12bn from the IPO proceeds to expand its dark store network, which feeds its rapid commerce arm operating in more than 30 cities.\n\nWhile still a small part of India\u2019s overall retail landscape, quick commerce has experienced explosive growth. Indian investment bank JM Financial predicts the industry could surge to $40bn by the end of the decade, driven by increasing urban demand for affordable and convenient delivery services.\n\n\u201cThe food delivery business is, pun intended, delivering profits in other markets,\u201d said Tiruchelvam, pointing to the success and scale of China\u2019s biggest delivery platform Meituan.\n\n\u201cOne is bullish about the asset class in a mass market like India where smartphone penetration is expanding and infrastructure for food delivery is improving.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/431d03f7-cab6-4214-9cc9-6c3a8ef9de96"}}, {"id": "6f1ae720-0b48-43b4-8f30-08343f485bc3", "event_name": "Foreign investors fear India\u2019s stock market boom may be over", "blurb": "International investors pull out more than $10bn from Indian stocks as indices record largest fall since March 2020", "date": "2024-11-0400:00:00.0", "body": "Foreign investors pulled more than $10bn out of Indian stocks in October, the biggest monthly exodus since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, on growing concerns that the market\u2019s huge bull run may finally be coming to an end as the economy slows.\n\nIndia\u2019s two main share indices last month posted their worst monthly losses since March 2020 while the rupee fell close to a record low against the US dollar, as international interest cools in what was one of the hottest global markets.\n\nInvestors increasingly fear that Indian shares, which have more than tripled since March 2020, could now struggle in the face of weak corporate earnings, signs of an economic slowdown and moves by the central bank to curb exuberant retail lending.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty classic cyclical economic downturn in India,\u201d said Saurabh Mukherjea, chief investment officer at Marcellus Investment Managers in Mumbai.\n\n\u201cThe question is if it\u2019s a few quarters or a more prolonged affair,\u201d said Mukherjea. He has been buying defensive stocks in sectors such as information technology and pharmaceuticals, which he believes will perform in \u201ctimes of uncertainty\u201d.\n\nInvestors have also sold down their positions to brace for volatility around the US elections and to free up money to chase the recent stimulus-driven rally in Chinese shares.\n\nFollowing October\u2019s outflow, net inflows from foreign investors for this year have dropped to just $2bn, according to stock exchange data. Even as money was still coming in earlier this year, foreign ownership of India\u2019s stock market dropped to a 12-year low amid an Indian retail investor frenzy for shares.\n\nA warning sign came in August with data showing that Indian GDP grew 6.7 per cent in the three months to June, its slowest rate in five quarters. India\u2019s \u201cgrowth glass looks half-empty\u201d, said Nomura economists last month.\n\nAfter hitting a series of record highs this year, the Nifty 50 index of blue-chip Indian stocks fell 6.2 per cent in October. The Sensex meanwhile fell 5.8 per cent, its worst month since March 2020. Even so, the MSCI India trades at 24 times forward earnings, just ahead of the roughly 23 times for the US\u2019s S&P 500 index.\n\nAlso driving stocks lower is a wide swath of Indian industry reporting sluggish earnings, with misses so far exceeding earnings beats, according to Goldman Sachs, whose analysts have lowered their rating on the country\u2019s equities from \u201coverweight\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe track the extent of downgrades on earnings. What we are seeing in India is fairly intense. Even [some] consumer staples are missing numbers,\u201d said Sunil Tirumalai, chief emerging markets strategist at UBS.\n\nData has indicated consumer confidence is slowing; Indian vehicle sales have dipped in recent months, while bellwethers such as Hindustan Unilever, the seller of Dove soap and Cornetto ice cream, had \u201cmuted\u201d industry-wide demand growth, chief financial officer Ritesh Tiwari told analysts.\n\nAn inflection point for the glut of Indian companies coming to market in 2024 came with the highly symbolic $3.3bn listing of Hyundai\u2019s Indian business on local stock bourses in October. Asia\u2019s largest float this year was poorly received by retail investors, who were put off by its elevated valuation and an industry-wide vehicle sales slowdown.\n\nExecutives at Citigroup, one of Hyundai\u2019s Indian bookrunners, nevertheless defended the listing and played down fears of a wider downturn.\n\n\u201cA temporary softness of one season or two months is not necessarily determining what our view on the outlook is for 2025,\u201d Rahul Saraf, head of India investment banking at Citi, told reporters last month.\n\nOther \u201clarge\u201d clients are \u201cvery keen\u201d to explore an Indian IPO, he added. \u201cI think they\u2019re actually encouraged with the listing of Hyundai [rather] than being discouraged.\u201d\n\nThe cooling in sentiment also comes as China\u2019s battered stock market enjoyed a stimulus-driven revival. Many overseas investors had been bullish on India while keeping positions in China low. But when Chinese stocks soared on news of the stimulus, many reduced Indian holdings to increase their bets on China or miss out on the rally.\n\nBut this shift would have limits, said Ashish Chugh, head of global emerging market equities at Loomis Sayles. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the stimulus is going to solve the long-term problem of painful debt restructuring\u201d given how much China\u2019s economy came to rely on borrowing for investment, he said.\n\nIndia\u2019s rally over the past year has been driven primarily by domestic investors ploughing bank deposits and household savings into the country\u2019s burgeoning public markets, but foreign investors may be growing concerned that even local risk appetite is close to saturation.\n\n\u201c[Local] retail money that is coming into the market is still supportive. But there are signs that you\u2019re actually reaching some limits on that,\u201d said UBS\u2019s Tirumalai.\n\nMuch now depends on whether Indian authorities take action to prevent a potential multiyear economic downturn, said Marcellus\u2019s Mukherjea. While the Reserve Bank of India has indicated it is open to easing its 6.5 per cent key policy rate, governor Shaktikanta Das has stated that a rate cut now would be too risky.\n\nGiven inflation is close to 6 per cent, the RBI \u201cfaces a tough call, but I think they need to start cutting rates sooner rather than later\u201d, Mukherjea added. \u201cProvided there is appropriate monetary and fiscal action, we should snap out of this by Christmas 2025.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d7ba1339-5326-4265-a360-04574a9239c0"}}, {"id": "6bd29a9f-bc37-4486-893a-6a54e540bcd3", "event_name": "Adani begins to cut off power supplies to Bangladesh", "blurb": "Indian conglomerate threatens to halt flows from coal-fired plant over debt dispute", "date": "2024-11-0300:00:00.0", "body": "The Indian conglomerate Adani Group has begun to curb electricity supplies to Bangladesh and threatened to completely shut down power exports as the new government in Dhaka struggles with a backlog of overdue payments.\n\nThe infrastructure-focused company owned by billionaire Gautam Adani on Thursday started slashing cross-border electricity flows by as much as half from its 1,600-megawatt capacity Godda coal-fired plant in eastern India, according to data published by Bangladesh\u2019s power grid.\n\nThe group has set a November 7 deadline for a full cut-off unless Bangladesh can clarify how it will settle amounts owed to the company, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAdani Group has previously warned that the overdue payments have become \u201cunsustainable\u201d.

He said Bangladesh now owed about $700mn. The amount, however, could rise as Adani continues to supply the country.\n\nThe dispute with the influential Indian tycoon, Asia\u2019s second-wealthiest individual, underscores the vulnerabilities of Bangladesh\u2019s economy after the dramatic ousting of authoritarian prime minister Sheikh Hasina by student protesters in August.

Concerts take place at sunrise, moonrise and throughout the day in its gardens, courtyards and sumptuous rooms. \u201cWe\u2019re a destination festival,\u201d says artistic director Divya Bhatia. \u201cYou need to be here to experience it and it\u2019s timed to coincide with Sharad Purnima, the brightest full Moon of the year.\u201d\n\nA sunrise concert on a high plateau near the fort starts at 5.30am, the pre-dawn sky dark, the musicians barely visible. As the Moon recedes, glowing like a sunset, the five players become silhouettes. Then the sun catches their red turbans while the air grows noticeably warmer.\n\nThe first group are Meghwals from the local weaving community of the Marwar region around Jodhpur. Specialising in meditative Hindu prayers or bhajans, the singers are Hindu, but the accompanying musicians are Muslim. As the dawn progresses, the music gradually increases in pace \u2014 powerful vocals accompanied by a plucked lute, small hand cymbals, and the irregular rhythms of a dholak drum, played on each end of the instrument.\n\nNext comes a troupe of Manganiyar, a hereditary musician community in Rajasthan celebrated for its virtuosity. The players are Muslim, but sing songs for their Hindu patrons \u2014 the state is rich in this syncretic music that transcends religious boundaries. By the time the concert ends at 7.30am, the day is already hot and the Mehrangarh fort in the background blazes orange in the sunshine.\n\nThe five-day Jodhpur RIFF, now in its 17th edition, is hosted by the Mehrangarh Museum Trust and its chair, Maharaja Gaj Singh II, hereditary ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur state). India\u2019s maharajas were stripped of their titles, privileges and privy purse in 1971, yet Bapji, as he is affectionately known, commands huge respect, with people touching his feet when they encounter him.\n\nAs a fan of Rajasthan\u2019s music, when Gaj Singh married in 1973 he arranged for a group of local Langa musicians \u2014 another hereditary community \u2014 to play in both Jodhpur and Delhi. \u201cI feared they might be the last surviving group of musicians, but I took them to Delhi to give them more exposure and they were very well received,\u201d he says.\n\nPre-independence, musicians would have played for the Maharaja at a huge number of royal and religious events, but now his resources are much diminished. So while there is support from the trust, there is also a greater reliance on tourism and ticket sales. \u201cTourism can help, but it is a double-edged sword,\u201d Gaj Singh says. \u201cIt can earn musicians a living, but at the same time it dilutes the authenticity. You have an audience that doesn\u2019t understand the music so it becomes limited.\u201d\u00a0When local musicians are playing to tourists they tend to concentrate on a small selection of familiar pieces that get a good response, rather than sustaining the deeper repertoire.\n\nRajasthan is India\u2019s largest state, and has an incredibly rich diversity of music and instruments, though with urbanisation and digitalisation traditional musicians are suffering. This was one of the reasons for the founding of RIFF, which has since broadened its remit to include musicians from other parts of India and abroad \u2014 more than 400 performers this year.\n\nAmong the highlights are two instrumentalists: Asin Khan and Dilshad Khan, on sarangi, one of Rajasthan\u2019s most sublime stringed instruments, played with a bow. A speciality of the Langa, it has three playing strings, but also 20 or so sympathetic strings, which resonate behind the melody and lend the instrument a haunting, ethereal aura.\n\nAsin Khan plays in a folk style, Dilshad Khan in a classical manner. The folk sarangi is the original while the classical instrument was developed in the 20th century. Sultan Khan, who died in 2011, was one of the latter\u2019s most celebrated players and Dilshad Khan\u2019s principal teacher. The classical sarangi is larger, more resonant and is played with a song-like lyricism. The folk sarangi is more earthy and free from the complex raga structures that classical musicians have to follow. What makes the performance so engrossing is hearing two masters playing the same instrument in two different styles, making the enormous potential of the sarangi apparent in a very focused way.\n\nAsin Khan lives in a village about 60km from Jodhpur, whereas Dilshad Khan spends most of his time in Mumbai, and though they hadn\u2019t played together until recently, they meet as equals. Indeed, part of RIFF\u2019s success has been in giving folk musicians the respect they deserve. The Maharaja admits that, in former times, folk musicians were at the bottom of the pecking order and many of them wouldn\u2019t have been allowed into the fort.\n\n\u201cThe festival is a force against feudalism, casteism and religious communalism,\u201d adds Bhatia. \u201cAnd to make people see the value of this music \u2014 most will never have heard anything like it, and most of the visitors are from India.\u201d The festival also attracts a healthy number of foreigners \u2014 some 15-20 per cent of the approximately 3,500 people who attend each evening concert.\n\nAmong the Rajasthani musicians in the final concert was Sumitra Das Goswami, performing wedding songs from the female point of view, rarely heard outside of a wedding. \u201cRIFF is a huge platform for folk artists of Rajasthan, who are scattered in many different villages across the state,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of artists were discovered here and have made it abroad.\u201d Sumitra is one of them, having recorded and performed with Laura Marling and Mumford & Sons at concerts in London and Bradford.\n\nRIFF also has its international performers, with musicians from Norway, Estonia, Azerbaijan, Mauritius and Korea. Among the highlights are Estonia\u2019s Puuluup (\u201cWood Loop\u201d), a brilliant duo reviving the talharpa \u2014 a moribund plucked and bowed Estonian folk instrument \u2014 with looper pedals and electronics. They were part of Estonia\u2019s Eurovision entry earlier this year, where their sophisticated music and irrepressible wit ensured they scored pretty badly. But at RIFF they are crowd favourites, the audience warming to their inventive, folk-derived music and amusing stage presence, and dancing in a frenzy in a palace courtyard well beyond midnight.\n\nThe Maharaja tells me that, as well as faithfully preserving tradition, he feels RIFF should be stimulating the creation of new Rajasthani music.

Analysts in China said the snub was because India had held G20 side meetings in the run-up to the summit in the disputed region of Kashmir, which is also claimed by Pakistan, and in Arunachal Pradesh, an Indian state in the Himalayas that China claims as its own.\n\nDespite the diplomatic chill, China has surpassed the US as India\u2019s biggest source of imports, with a large deficit in Beijing\u2019s favour. Some Modi government officials and advisers have favoured easing limits on foreign direct investment and visas for Chinese nationals, which business groups say are impeding India\u2019s push to become a major \u201cChina plus one\u201d manufacturing nation.\n\nLin Minwang, a professor at the Centre for South Asian Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said that during its development, China had run large trade deficits with advanced manufacturing economies such as Japan.\n\n\u201cIf India wants to make much progress in manufacturing, they have to have strong trade with China because China provides low-cost intermediary and capital goods, which will reduce the burden for Indian industrialisation,\u201d Lin said.\n\nChina\u2019s emphasis on a \u201cmultipolar\u201d world is seen by analysts as code for its agenda of eroding US global dominance and creating more room for its own emergence as a superpower.\n\nXi is keen to use groupings such as the Brics to promote his agenda of creating an alternative world order, even though it includes democracies such as India and Brazil that have better relations with Washington.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8e401438-5c6b-401e-b49b-e88dff54e40e"}}, {"id": "ac96def4-feca-445c-b87f-284ccc3aff77", "event_name": "To keep, or not to keep books\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009", "blurb": "That is the question that eventually faces all booklovers when the ever-growing stacks around the house threaten to fall", "date": "2024-10-2200:00:00.0", "body": "Every reader knows the moment when the paths of destiny fork. You must either become a Chucker, steel your nerves and give away old books before they march into the linen cupboards and storm the sofas, the dining table, the guest room, or become a Keeper, accept defeat and move to a larger home, just to accommodate the relentless tide of a personal library gone rogue.This is a fraught issue, as the late French novelist Georges Perec wrote in \u201cBrief Notes on the Art and Manner of Arranging One\u2019s Books\u201d, his classic 1978 essay: \u201cBut for us, who continue to have to do with a\u00a0human race that insists on thinking, writing, and above all publishing, the increasing size of our libraries tends to become the one real problem.\u201dNote the neat reversal of responsibility \u2014 every true bibliophile believes, hand on heart, that they are not to blame for the steady accumulation of books in the house. I personally suspect that the volumes piled up everywhere in my own home, these paper towers of Babel that threaten to topple on the heads of unwary guests, have sneaked in from a parallel universe, multiplying the moment you take your eye off them. My husband and I have a modest collection of roughly 4,000 tomes, and yet we\u2019re wading in up to our necks: how many is too many?\n\nThe novelist Hanya Yanagihara houses 12,000 books in double-sided bookcases that act as a wall; Umberto Eco, the late medievalist and author, arranged his living spaces around 44,000 books and another 1,200 antique volumes; the hugely popular British food writer Nigella Lawson has amassed a collection of more than 6,000, many of them cookbooks. And I take heart from the example of Bhimrao Ambedkar, the great anti-caste reformer who drafted India\u2019s Constitution \u2014 his personal library ran to 50,000 volumes, at that time one of the largest private libraries in the world.\u00a0A simple principle emerges: intention matters. Booklovers who organise their lives and their homes around their desire to have a research library at hand are seldom overwhelmed in the manner of us amateurs who buy books on impulse, letting a library grow over time.\n\nAmbedkar is said to have built his home, Rajgruha in Bombay (now Mumbai), over three storeys specifically to accommodate his books, with ample room to add more during his lifetime. Eco\u2019s vast collection is now in Italy\u2019s Bologna University, except for 1,200 antique books sent to Milan\u2019s Braidense Library, and is arranged in the precise order in which he\u2019d kept them at home. And the late designer Karl Lagerfeld left instructions for the future maintenance of his 33,000 volumes. \u201cBooks are sufficient to themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey ask for nothing and they are silently patient, but they are always there for you.\u201d\n\nThat said, not all collections have a happy future. In The Diary of a Bookseller, Shaun Bythell, owner of The Bookshop, the largest second-hand bookshop in Scotland, chronicles the fate of books once loved, now unwanted by inheritors and family members. He salvages what he can, inspects collections in the libraries of great country houses. And he explains to optimists who show up at his store with worn editions of Dickens that not all old books are worth much beyond sentimental value. Similarly, in the auction houses of Kolkata on Russel Street, and in the busy second-hand book market in New Delhi\u2019s Daryaganj, painstakingly acquired collections are hawked for less than a few pounds, or sold by the kilo.\n\nOver three decades, I went from being a Keeper, determined to cherish every last bequest, gift and purchase because it seemed like a truer record of my changing interests and passions than even a diary, to being a gentle but firm Chucker. I tried and failed at some of the \u201crules\u201d of letting go of old books \u2014 Marie Kondo\u2019s suggestion that you discard what doesn\u2019t spark joy is useless when you have fond memories of much of your collection, and the sage dictum to give away a book for every one you buy only works for the most organised among us.\u00a0Instead, I take my cue from gardeners, pruning and weeding our collection every few years, giving hundreds of books away to friends or small libraries. Some books will never go \u2014 my grandmother\u2019s collection of romances, copies autographed by writers, the old, tattered friends I passionately love. But every reader outgrows their own reading, in time. I would rather those books were in the hands of others who will care for them, turn their pages, give them an honoured space on their shelves. The tower on the desk is Eiffelesque; my husband\u2019s study should bear a sign warning friends to enter at their own risk; time for another cull.

At a regular press briefing in Beijing on Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian reiterated that China would work towards \u201cgreater Brics co-operation\u201d and a \u201cnew era for the global south\u201d.\n\nThe potential agreement comes a month after Wang Yi, Xi\u2019s top diplomat, held talks with India\u2019s national security adviser Ajit Doval. Chinese state media said at the time that the two sides had \u201cagreed to work together to create conditions for the improvement of bilateral relations\u201d.\n\nIndia and China fought a major war in 1962, and the almost 3,500km-long LAC, which crosses through some of the world\u2019s highest places in the Himalayas, is one of Asia\u2019s most tense arenas of geopolitical conflict.\n\nChina has built villages along the LAC in Tibet in an effort to bolster its presence there, and India is undertaking a similar effort under its \u201cVibrant Villages\u201d programme.\n\nAfter the clashes in and around Ladakh\u2019s Galwan Valley, both sides each deployed at least 50,000 more troops to the LAC, with India diverting some soldiers there from the areas bordering Pakistan. India\u2019s government complained that areas where its troops formerly patrolled freely had been blocked by their Chinese counterparts.\n\nThe Modi government has since 2020 driven a hard line on the issue, making de-escalation around the LAC a condition of resuming \u201cnormal\u201d relations with Beijing.\n\nDetails of which specific areas were covered by the understanding announced on Monday were not immediately available.\n\nIn the wake of the 2020 violence at the LAC, India banned dozens of Chinese apps and began implementing some of the toughest restrictions on inward investment from China of any country.\n\nBusinesspeople have, however, in recent months complained that the draconian restrictions on Chinese foreign direct investment and the provision of visas to Chinese nationals were slowing India\u2019s drive to develop its manufacturing sector, and some officials inside the Modi government favoured easing them.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ding Wenjie in Beijing", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e2929860-9f34-451b-98b9-c525562778ee"}}, {"id": "3b0af066-3156-4308-bacf-c202aa7f8855", "event_name": "Sikh separatist leader vows to keep fighting India from Toronto", "blurb": "Murder of former Khalistan movement head further sours relations between Trudeau and Modi governments", "date": "2024-10-2100:00:00.0", "body": "Inderjeet Singh Gosal says he is not afraid to die for an independent Sikh homeland in India\u2019s Punjab region.\n\nThe 35-year-old\u2019s declaration sounds incongruous as he sits in his comfortable home in Toronto\u2019s suburbs. But after the assassination of his predecessor as head of the Khalistan movement, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the risk is real.\n\n\u201cI know what I signed up for, death doesn\u2019t scare me,\u201d Gosal said. \u201cIndia\u2019s threats or any assassination attempts would not stop my effort for\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Khalistan.\u201d\n\nThis week Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, expelled six Indian diplomats, including the high commissioner, because of their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar, who was gunned down in Vancouver in June 2023.\n\nTrudeau on Monday said: \u201cWe will never tolerate the involvement of a foreign government in threatening and killing Canadian citizens on Canadian soil, a deeply unacceptable violation of Canada\u2019s sovereignty and of international law.\u201d\n\nIndia, which sees the Khalistan activists as terrorists, has denied any involvement and expelled six Canadian diplomats in response. It accuses Ottawa of tolerating violent extremism that has cost the lives of its citizens.\n\nIndia has levelled the same accusation at the US. Last week, federal prosecutors charged an Indian government official with orchestrating a plot to murder a Sikh activist in New York City. India has designated that activist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a terrorist under its Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.\n\nThe tit-for-tat expulsions between India and Canada are the latest episode in the increasingly fraught relations between Ottawa and New Delhi over the activities of Canada\u2019s large Sikh community.\n\nThe movement for a sovereign Sikh state called Khalistan dates back to India\u2019s independence from Britain in 1947 and gained momentum after anti-Sikh killings in the wake of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s assassination in 1984.\n\nSikhs such as Gosal describe the violence as a \u201cgenocide\u201d that forced thousands to flee India, many to Canada. Some 771,790 Canadians identified as belonging to the Sikh faith in the 2021 census, making it the largest Sikh community outside India.\n\nCanada\u2019s relations with India have soured in recent years as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has become increasingly critical of what he says is Ottawa\u2019s failure to clamp down on Sikh extremism.\n\nThe worst mass murder in Canadian history, the bombing of an Air India flight travelling from Montreal to London in June 1985, has been blamed on Sikh extremists. All 329 people on board were killed. Two pro-Khalistan diaspora Sikhs were charged in the incident but later acquitted.\n\nWhile the majority of Canadian Sikhs are peaceful or not engaged in the Khalistan movement, Ottawa has listed other Sikh groups such as Babbar Khalsa International and the International Sikh Youth Federation as terrorist organisations.\n\nThe rift also highlights the complex nature of diaspora politics in Canada.\n\n\u201cWe are a migrant nation, and diaspora politics is a real facet of Canadian politics,\u201d said Colin Robertson, a former diplomat who is vice-president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute in Ottawa. \u201cThis complicates our foreign policy because you always have to make allowance to minority groups. Sometimes you have to turn a blind eye to extreme views, as it has an impact on various ridings [constituencies].\u201d\n\nIndia has long pleaded with Canada to curb behaviour it considers a terrorist threat and which Ottawa sees as permissible political activism.\n\nPannun admitted to Indian media last year that he posted flyers outside the Sikh temple near Vancouver where Nijjar was killed that read \u201cKill India\u201d and featured names and photos of Indian diplomats.\n\nIn turn, Canada has alleged growing Indian interference in its Sikh communities. That came to a head last year when Trudeau accused the Modi government of being involved in the fatal shooting of Nijjar.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Monday warned Canadians about suspected Indian involvement in \u201cserious criminal activity\u201d, including drive-by shootings, home invasions, violent extortion and even murder. The Indian government denies any involvement.\n\nA public inquiry that has been running since last year has also heard evidence that India directly interfered in Canada\u2019s 2019 and 2021 general elections.\n\nFormer Canadian intelligence agent Phil Gurski said the inquiry highlighted how Trudeau\u2019s government had either ignored, played down or repeatedly missed warnings of foreign meddling in Canadian life, whether political or in diaspora communities.\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s intelligence community is not happy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been saying this for a while.\u201d\n\nGurski said Canada was caught between global pressures from superpowers China and India, and local politics and security concerns. It is also aware India is strategically important for the Five Eyes alliance of the US, Canada, the UK, New Zealand and Australia.\n\n\u201cThe political power of Sikh diaspora is real,\u201d he said. \u201cTrudeau could kiss the Sikh vote goodbye if they did favours for India, like sending a wanted separatist back. Canada does not want to upset the diaspora vote, they rely on it.\u201d\n\nFor Gosal, the claims made last week about Indian government involvement in Nijjar\u2019s death came as no surprise.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was India from the minute they killed Nijjar. We knew there was a threat or it was dangerous, but we didn\u2019t think it would go this far, that they\u2019d kill a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that in February, months after he took over leadership of the Khalistan movement, a bullet was fired into a window at a site run by his construction business. An Indian account on X had posted about the shooting before police arrived.\n\nIn August, local police called him to warn he was the target of a murder plot, he said. \u201cAll this is absolutely tied to the government of India,\u201d said Gosal. \u201cThey are posting tweets about it, openly making threats.

It is expanding production capacity for its sport utility vehicle line-up and intends to introduce four EV models.\n\nHyundai has made significant inroads into India compared with other foreign carmakers \u2014 Ford and General Motors have abandoned the market in recent years \u2014 but the listing has coincided with a slowdown in India\u2019s motor industry, with consumers hit by stubborn inflation.\n\nThe Nifty Auto index has fallen 6.9 per cent this month, and Bajaj Auto, one of the country\u2019s biggest sellers of motorcycles, saw its shares plunge 13 per cent after it issued a sales warning on Thursday.\n\nSigns of weaker sales during India\u2019s months-long festival season \u201cdefinitely hampered the situation\u201d, said Abhishek Jain, head of research at Mumbai brokerage Arihant Capital, who added that Hyundai\u2019s offer had been \u201caggressively priced\u201d for such a large IPO.The float marks the first time Hyundai has listed outside its home market and is part of a global push following an erosion of sales in China over the past decade, where it has been hit by the rapid rise of domestic rivals.\n\nHyundai said its Indian unit accounted for about 18 per cent of global sales last year. With 1.4bn people and one of the fastest-growing large economies, India recently overtook Japan as the third-largest car market in the world after China and the US, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.\n\nThe Korean company entered India in 1996 and first began mass producing its compact Santro car two years later. Hyundai now plans to invest $3.8bn in the country over the next decade and expand local capacity to about 1.1mn units by 2028 from 824,000 units now.\n\nHyundai operates two car plants close to the

immediately respond to a request for comment on the indictment.\n\nIn charges unsealed on Thursday, prosecutors claimed Yadav \u2014 who is believed to be in India \u2014 had overseen a scheme to kill Pannun, providing his address in New York and his phone numbers to the would-be assassin, who was an undercover US agent.\n\nIn June 2023, Yadav was also allegedly communicating about the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, an associate of Pannun\u2019s and a fellow Sikh activist, in a suburb of Vancouver, Canada.\n\nYadav sent a video of Nijjar\u2019s body to an associate,

Sunil Bharti Mittal over the way satellite spectrum should be awarded, as the billionaires battle over the introduction of space-fed internet to the world\u2019s most populous country.\n\nAmbani, Asia\u2019s richest man and chair of oil-to-digital services conglomerate Reliance Industries, along with Mittal\u2019s Bharti Airtel, have been trying to persuade India\u2019s government to auction satellite spectrum, in line with the usual competitive method in the mobile market they dominate, rather than just allocate it.\n\nMusk, chief executive of SpaceX and owner of the Starlink satellite broadband service, took to his social media site X this week to say that any such moves by India would be \u201cunprecedented, as this spectrum was long designated by the [International Telecommunication Union] as shared spectrum for satellites\u201d. India is a member of the ITU.\n\nSoon after, Mittal voiced his support for the auction process. Addressing a conference in New Delhi, he specifically told Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who sat in the audience, that satellite companies serving urban areas \u201cneed to pay telecom licences like everyone else\u201d.\n\nAmbani\u2019s Reliance had written to the telecoms regulator and the government last week, accusing it of pre-emptively concluding that allocation was the way forward, according to a letter seen by the Financial Times and a person familiar with the matter.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Indian communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said there were no plans afoot to auction space spectrum. \u201cMuch appreciated!\u201d Musk posted on X in response. \u201cWe will do our best to serve the people of India with Starlink.\u201d\n\nThis year, the Financial Times reported that Mittal and Ambani were frontrunners to introduce satellite internet services ahead of Musk\u2019s Starlink, which has yet to receive licences. The Indian businessmen enjoy a near duopoly in telecoms domestically and EY-Parthenon estimates that space broadband is a potential $1bn annual revenue market for the country.\n\n\u201cWe have deep pockets and we can spend money to buy extra spectrum\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009this will keep small players away,\u201d said a person close to Reliance. \u201cIf it is not auction, and allocation, because it\u2019s a new technology, a lot of unwanted players might enter.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s parliament late last year enacted a law that allowed allocation of satellite-based spectrum, instead of the country\u2019s traditional auction method. Last month, the telecoms regulator requested feedback from industry players, with a deadline set for later in October.\n\nBharti Airtel, which plans to launch satellite internet in a joint venture with Anglo-French group Eutelsat OneWeb, said in a statement that operators serving urban areas and retail customers should go through the auction process.\n\nA person close to the company said only services reaching currently unserved communities should be assigned spectrum, to allow for a \u201clevel playing field\u201d after Indian operators invested \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d in terrestrial connections.\n\n\u201cThe local guys are arguing there should be uniformity in the rules,\u201d said Vivekanand Subbaraman, technology analyst at Ambit Capital in Mumbai. \u201cPrincipally, they want these companies to be subject to the same licensing norms, the same spectrum norms.\u201d\n\nHowever, another industry expert described the tussle as an \u201cego battle\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about ensuring that the telecom industry remains in control of the local players rather than foreigners coming in and dictating their agenda,\u201d they said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other explanation, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a scarcity of spectrum, it\u2019s abundant.\u201d\n\nA simple assignment of spectrum may hand Musk\u2019s company, the largest and most successful of its kind, a \u201cfirst-mover advantage\u201d, while an auction process would allow Indian players time to get their products market-ready, said the person close to Reliance.\n\nMusk told Modi last year that he wanted to bring Starlink, which operates more than 6,000 low-orbit satellites, to India to connect remote communities. Musk also has his eye on the long-term potential of India as a location for a Tesla plant, despite cancelling a trip to New Delhi earlier this year to prioritise talks with and focus on its Asian rival China.

Most recently imprisoned in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s home state of Gujarat, he has been accused by police in Punjab, Mumbai and elsewhere of continuing to plot extortion, murder, and other crimes from behind bars.\n\nOn Monday night in Ottawa, Brigitte Gauvin, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police assistant commissioner, said \u201corganised crime elements\u201d were being used against Sikh Canadians such as the late Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who campaigned for an independent state, or \u201cKhalistan\u201d, in the Punjab region, and was shot dead last year.\n\nShe went on to mention the Bishnoi gang by name, saying: \u201cWe believe that that group is connected to agents of India.\u201d\n\nBishnoi was already a familiar figure to many Indians. He was born in 1993 near the Pakistan border in India\u2019s majority-Sikh Punjab state, one of its main sources of emigrants to Canada, the US and the UK.\n\nHe has been charged in more than three dozen cases, some of which are pending, and convicted of offences including attempted murder and possession of illegal firearms.\n\nDuring Bishnoi\u2019s decade in prison, news reports \u2014 often based on anonymous police sources \u2014 have linked him or his gang members, whose number Indian authorities estimate at 700, with shootings and other crimes. He has given interviews from behind bars, leading to speculation that he has access to phones or other devices in prison.\n\nNow Bishnoi\u2019s group was being named at a press briefing about a murder case in Canada that has inflamed tensions with India, and has stirred disquiet among New Delhi\u2019s western partners, which have been keen to bolster it as a strategic ally against China.\n\nAn Indian government official, who asked not to be named, on Tuesday accused Ottawa of making \u201cvague accusations\u201d and putting the burden of denial on New Delhi, in an apparent response to the Bishnoi claims.\n\n\u201cAt the [Canadian police] press briefing, assertions were made about connections of certain individuals to India,\u201d the official said. \u201cIn no case were specifics provided.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s government has not directly responded to the Canadian police claim about Indian agents using Bishnoi\u2019s syndicate. Bishnoi\u2019s lawyer could not be reached for comment.\n\nBishnoi is frequent fodder for Indian tabloids, and this was the second time this week he made national headlines. On Sunday, an associate of his gang claimed responsibility for the fatal shooting of Baba Siddique, a politician who was close to Bollywood stars in the commercial capital Mumbai.\n\nClaims of possible links between Indian officials and criminals have added further pressure to the diplomatic crisis over Nijjar\u2019s fatal shooting, as officials in Canada and the US investigate claims that the world\u2019s largest democracy sponsors killings overseas.\n\nIndia on Monday rejected what it called \u201cpreposterous imputations\u201d by Canada, and expelled six diplomats, hours after Ottawa deported six Indians including its high commissioner Sanjay Verma. India said its diplomats had left because of fears for their safety.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, said the six had been identified as \u201cpersons of interest\u201d in Nijjar\u2019s killing in a suburb of Vancouver. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadian police found \u201cclear and compelling evidence\u201d that agents of the Indian government were involved in \u201cactivities that pose a significant threat to public safety\u201d.\n\nIn the separate US case, federal prosecutors have charged Indian citizen Nikhil Gupta with conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire in a foiled plot against US-based Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh. They say that scheme was directed by an Indian official. Gupta has pleaded not guilty in the case, which has alarmed Washington.\n\nThe US Department of State on Monday said an Indian committee of inquiry into the alleged murder plot would be visiting Washington from Tuesday. India\u2019s government has denied involvement in the Nijjar killing and the Singh plot, but analysts say its vow to investigate the latter is a reflection of the greater value it places on ties with the US.\n\n\u201cIt is extraordinary for a country that calls itself democratic, and is considered democratic by other countries, to do what they\u2019re accused of doing,\u201d said Priya Chacko, an associate professor of international politics at the University of Adelaide. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you would expect from an authoritarian regime.\u201d\n\nIndian media on Tuesday reported widely on Canada\u2019s linking of the Bishnoi gang with the crimes in Canada. Broadcaster India Today dismissed it as an \u201cold claim\u201d. Modi\u2019s government has accused Canada of harbouring extremist Sikhs and criminal elements in its diaspora population.\n\nBishnoi and his gang have been connected with other violent crimes in India. In April this year, when gunmen fired shots outside Bollywood superstar Salman Khan\u2019s home in an attempt on his life, Indian media connected Bishnoi with the case. He did not claim responsibility, but he had previously been captured on film threatening Khan, saying he would \u201cdefinitely kill him\u201d.\n\nKhan was convicted in 1998 of poaching two blackbucks, an endangered species of antelope; Bishnoi\u2019s community, a religious grouping that practises vegetarianism, views the animal as sacred.\n\nIn 2022 Bishnoi\u2019s name was linked to the assassination of Sidhu Moose Wala, a Punjabi singer. His gang claimed responsibility for the shooting, but Bishnoi himself never did, though he and several others were charged. He has denied responsibility for the murder.\n\nIn Canada, police in May charged three men with first-degree murder in Nijjar\u2019s killing.\n\nOne analyst described the Canada-India showdown as indicative of a \u201cmore muscular foreign policy\u201d under Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party-led government.\n\n\u201cTo see two countries that are both democracies and both claim to be advocates of the rules-based international order \u2014 and both close allies of the US \u2014 have such a public breakdown in relations is surprising,\u201d said Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for south Asia at Chatham House. \u201cThese are two countries that are supposed to be on the same side.\u201d\n\nCanadian police continue to investigate Nijjar\u2019s death, along with what Trudeau said were allegations of Indian state involvement in \u201cclandestine information-gathering techniques, coercive behaviour targeting south Asian Canadians, and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts\u201d.\n\nBut the allegation of the Bishnoi gang\u2019s involvement has compounded an escalating scandal.

New Delhi announced it was expelling six Canadian diplomats, including Stewart Wheeler, Canada\u2019s deputy high commissioner, asking them to leave by Saturday.\n\nA senior Canadian police officer said there were \u201clinks tying Indian government agents to homicides and violent acts\u201d directed at Sikh supporters of an independent \u201cKhalistan\u201d in the Punjab region, which is split between India and Pakistan. New Delhi considers the activists to be terrorists.\n\nMike Duheme, commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), suggested the activity went beyond Nijjar\u2019s assassination. He said there had been \u201cwell over a dozen credible and imminent threats to life, which had led law enforcement agencies to warn members of the south Asian community and specifically members of the pro-Khalistan movement\u201d.\n\nTrudeau said there was evidence Indian government agents were involved in activities that included \u201cclandestine information gathering techniques, coercive behaviour targeting south Asian Canadians, and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including murder\u201d.\n\nA Canadian government official said Verma and five other diplomats had been informed that they were \u201cpersona non grata\u201d, effective on Monday morning.\n\nTrudeau on Monday described India\u2019s actions as a \u201cdeeply unacceptable violation of Canada\u2019s sovereignty and international law\u201d. He said he had raised the matter with Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, and had \u201cimpressed upon him that it needs to be taken very very seriously\u201d.\n\nDuheme, the police commissioner, said the Canadian force had investigated and charged \u201ca significant number\u201d of individuals for their involvement in homicides, extortion and other criminal acts of violence.\n\nNew Delhi said it reserved the right to take \u201cfurther steps\u201d in response to what it called \u201cthe Trudeau government\u2019s support for extremism, violence and separatism against India\u201d.\n\nTrudeau caused an uproar in India last year when he said Canada was investigating \u201ccredible allegations\u201d that Indian agents might have been behind the assassination of Nijjar, who campaigned for the creation of an independent \u201cKhalistan\u201d.\n\nThe accusations, combined with a US criminal case brought against suspects in an alleged murder plot against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US-Canadian Sikh separatist, shone a light on claims of alleged official targeting of diaspora activists whom India considers terrorists.\n\nIndia has rejected allegations of government involvement in Nijjar\u2019s killing and the attempt on Pannun\u2019s life.\n\nCanadian authorities in May arrested and charged three Indian nationals with Nijjar\u2019s shooting. The RCMP said at the time it was investigating whether there were any ties to the government of India, adding that others might have been involved in the killing.\n\nWheeler told reporters in New Delhi: \u201cThe government of Canada has done what India has long been asking for, and Canada has provided credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the government of India and a murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\u201d\n\nJoly confirmed in a statement that Monday\u2019s expulsions were because of \u201ca targeted campaign against Canadian citizens by agents linked to the government of India\u201d.\n\nIndia rejected what it said were \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cludicrous\u201d allegations against its diplomats, and attacked Trudeau personally.\n\n\u201cHis cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India,\u201d the ministry of external affairs said.\n\nVerma could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe diplomatic dispute over Nijjar\u2019s killing has brought relations between India and Canada to a low point, with New Delhi expelling most Canadian diplomats and temporarily suspending visa services last year.\n\nIndian officials have accused the Trudeau government of pandering to Sikh voters with views New Delhi considers extreme, in what it has called \u201cvote bank politics\u201d.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7280dc0c-51bf-45cc-a277-7f4a1d87c599"}}, {"id": "1ecee0a9-9173-4ff8-8b76-70b7f2a53059", "event_name": "While Europe frets, India expects", "blurb": "European foreboding about peace and stability in the world finds little echo in New Delhi ", "date": "2024-10-1400:00:00.0", "body": "I never used to look at airline route maps too closely. But now, when I journey from one peaceful country to another, I take a keener interest in where exactly we are flying over.\n\nOn a flight from London to New Delhi last week, I noticed with incredulity that the route map suggested that we were passing between Donetsk in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. The flight then took us over Russia (this was Air India), then just north of Iran, then over Afghanistan \u2014 and finally on to India.\n\nJournalists like to talk about \u201ctrouble spots\u201d. But the journey from western Europe to India felt like a trip between two \u201csafe spots\u201d separated by a sea of troubles.\n\nHow long can the world\u2019s safe spots keep the sea of troubles at bay? And what is the best strategy for preserving the peace and prosperity of countries that are living on the edge of regions at war?\n\nI\u2019ve encountered different answers to those questions on three trips I\u2019ve made over the past month \u2014 to Germany, to Bulgaria and now to India.\n\nIn Germany, there was a stark division of opinion. Boris Pistorius, the country\u2019s defence minister, has warned that Russia could attack a Nato country within five to eight years. Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, a prominent member of the Christian Democratic opposition, argues that the best way to prevent that happening is to defeat Russia in Ukraine. He wants to see much more military aid for Kyiv and a dramatic increase in German defence spending.\n\nBut the parties of the German far right and far left \u2014 which now account for about 30 per cent of the electorate \u2014 argue that it is not Russia but the US and Nato that threaten the peace of Europe. They want to give up on Ukraine and to reach out to the Russians.\n\nThat school of thought is also increasingly prominent in Bulgaria. One pro-Nato Bulgarian politician laments: \u201cWe have lost the word \u2018peace\u2019 to the pro-Russian forces.\u201d Bulgarian liberals fear that it is not just rhetorical battles that they may lose in their struggle with pro-Putin populists. With the country heading for its seventh election in three years, the prestige of Bulgarian democracy is declining. Liberals fear their country could be vulnerable to the appeal of a pro-Russian strongman, like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The gains for Bulgarian democracy and sovereignty made after 1989 feel newly fragile.\n\nThe population of Bulgaria is roughly 20 per cent of that of the Indian capital alone. India\u2019s sheer size and its distance from the frontline mean that its elites wave away suggestions that a victorious Putin would threaten their own security.\n\nAmerican, Japanese and European policymakers have made frequent efforts to persuade their Indian counterparts that a Russian victory in Ukraine would embolden China \u2014 whose forces killed Indian troops in a border clash in 2020. But the conventional wisdom in New Delhi is still that India needs a strong Russia to balance China.\n\nIn much of the global south, western arguments about Russian aggression and war crimes are rejected as hypocritical, given America\u2019s unstinting support for Israel. But while Modi\u2019s India sees itself as a leader of the global south, the country views the Middle East very differently. Shekhar Gupta, a prominent Indian journalist, observes that there is an \u201coverwhelming pro-Israel mood among the majority in India\u201d. One prominent member of the governing BJP told me: \u201cThe average party footsoldier is all for Israel bombing the hell out of Muslim terrorists.\u201d India has abstained on several UN resolutions condemning Israel and continues to be an enthusiastic buyer of Israeli weaponry and technology.\n\nTo the extent that Indians feel threatened by the spreading war in the Middle East, their main concerns are a rise in oil prices, an upsurge in Islamist militancy at home and risks to Indians working in the Gulf. The safety of Indian troops serving with the UN in Lebanon may soon be added to that list.\n\nEven the threat posed by China has an upside for India. The country stands to benefit, as western multinationals try to diversify away from China and lessen dependence on Chinese technology. That effort received official backing with the launch of a US-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology \u2014 deepening co-operation between the two countries on a range of areas including space, semiconductors and artificial intelligence.\n\nRising geopolitical tensions are seen as a business and strategic opportunity for India. As a result, the sense of foreboding about the direction of the world that is so evident in Europe and in liberal America is strikingly absent in official Indian circles.\n\nAre Indians wrong to feel largely protected from the conflicts and tensions in the wider world?\n\nOne disquieting possibility that should concern them is the risk that various regional conflicts could become increasingly entangled. They already touch each other at various points. Russia and China have conducted joint air patrols near Alaska and the Sea of Japan. Iran has supplied weapons to Russia. If Israel attacks Iran, Russia might return the favour or seek to profit in other ways. With the western alliance distracted by conflicts elsewhere, China might see a chance to up the pressure in Asia.\n\nIf the conflicts in Europe, the Middle East and Asia begin to merge, the world\u2019s sea of troubles will soon be lapping on India\u2019s shores.\n\ngideon.rachman@ft.com", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8f7a2f2d-fcf1-42da-b65c-15d80dbad291"}}, {"id": "e27e2ed9-7f19-4057-b77f-d06053ae7ba9", "event_name": "India\u2019s copycat drugmakers gear up to offer cheaper weight-loss drugs", "blurb": "Expiry of Novo Nordisk\u2019s UK patent for Saxenda seen as offering a \u2018dry run\u2019 for future generic versions of Ozempic ", "date": "2024-10-1300:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s powerful copycat pharmaceutical industry is set to roll out generic weight-loss drugs in the UK within weeks, with one leading producer forecasting a \u201chuge price war\u201d that could widen access to the popular medicines.\n\nBengaluru-based Biocon is the first company to win UK authorisation to offer a generic version of Novo Nordisk\u2019s Saxenda weight treatment and is ready to launch sales by November.\n\nSaxenda is an older drug of the same GLP-1 drug class as the Danish company\u2019s popular Ozempic diabetes treatment and Wegovy weight-loss medication.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Biocon chief executive Siddharth Mittal declined to comment on his pricing strategy for generic Saxenda, but predicted his company\u2019s sales of the drug would reach \u00a318mn annually in the UK after the expiry of its patent protection there next month. Mittal said he expected Biocon\u2019s generic version of Saxenda to be approved by the EU this year and in the US by 2025.\n\n\u201cWhen the generics come in there will be a huge price war,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a huge demand for these drugs at the right price.\u201d\n\nIn the US, Israeli drugmaker Teva in June launched a generic version of Victoza, a Novo Nordisk diabetes drug based on liraglutide, the same active ingredient as Saxenda.\n\nThe introduction of generic versions of Saxenda could prove a \u201cdry run for semaglutide\u201d, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, said Christopher Sharp, an intellectual property lawyer at Pinsent Masons.\n\nSharp said there was likely to be strong competition from generics companies interested in developing GLP-1s \u201cbecause the prize is so high\u201d.\n\nBiocon and other large Indian generic producers including Cipla, Dr Reddy\u2019s and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries have been eagerly awaiting the erosion of Novo Nordisk\u2019s exclusivity on GLP-1s.\n\nThe Danish company\u2019s patents for semaglutide, the active ingredient in its blockbuster weekly Ozempic and Wegovy treatments, will begin to expire across Asia, Africa and the Americas from 2026 and from 2030 in the US.\n\nWegovy and Ozempic powered Novo Nordisk to record sales in 2023. The global market in GLP-1s is expected to grow to over $140bn by 2030 from under $40bn in 2023, according to GlobalData, a data provider.\n\nExperts say entry of generic competition can typically result in a loss of around 80 per cent of the market share of the original supplier, and falls in drug prices of about 20-30 per cent.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s sales of Saxenda are down 36 per cent in the first half of 2024. The drug must be injected daily and is less effective than once-weekly treatments such as Wegovy and rival Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro.\n\nNovo Nordisk declined to comment. The Danish company is focused on increasing supply of semaglutide to meet runaway demand in the US and existing markets and to introduce it to new countries.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have enough manufacturing capacity,\u201d said Prashant Nair, director at Mumbai-based Ambit Capital. \u201c[That] is something Indian companies can provide and if that happens then India and other emerging markets can open up.\u201d\n\nIndia is expected to be a core driver of GLP-1 sales for the country\u2019s generic drug sector, the world\u2019s biggest.

In 1991, he took over as chair from\u00a0his uncle, JRD Tata. His accession coincided with India\u2019s economic opening to the world, and under his leadership the group ventured abroad.\n\nIt began by buying British tea maker Tetley Tea in 2000. By 2007, Tata had completed a takeover of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, which eventually cost $13bn and left it owning a clutch of UK factories. The timing, just before the global financial crisis, was disastrous. Tata later said the UK plants were\u00a0\u201cunderinvested and overmanned\u201d.\n\nThe group announced it wanted\u00a0to divest in 2016 and this September closed its blast furnaces at the UK\u2019s biggest steelworks in Port Talbot. Under a deal with the UK government, it plans to develop greener forms of steelmaking at the plant.\n\nIn March 2008, Tata bought British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover from Ford for $2.3bn. In just two years, the Indian group founded under British colonial rule had become the UK\u2019s biggest manufacturing employer. Critics who decried the deal as value-destructive were briefly silenced when JLR contributed strongly to Tata Motors profits\u00a0three years later, but JLR has since had a\u00a0chequered record.\n\nTata\u2019s pet projects included the Tata Nano, an ultra-cheap car marketed at Rs100,000, then worth $2,600, to help bring millions more middle-class Indians to the automotive market. But sales of the Nano were dismal and Tata Motors took years to recover from its costly failure. \u201cI\u2019m very depressed,\u201d\u00a0Tata said\u00a0of the Nano\u2019s flop.\n\nMore recently, as group chair emeritus, Tata enthusiastically supported the reacquisition of national carrier Air India, which was founded by JRD Tata but nationalised in 1953, in a deal that valued the struggling airline at $2.4bn. In a tweet welcoming Air India back into the family fold, Tata said his uncle \u201cwould have been overjoyed\u201d.\n\nTata had cultivated a reputation for straight-dealing, and despite an enthusiasm for private aircraft and flashy sports cars, presented a modest lifestyle relative to the ostentatious spending of fellow Indian tycoons. He was revered in Mumbai as India Inc\u2019s elder statesman, and praised for his humility.\n\nIn 2014, Britain awarded Tata an honorary knighthood for his contribution to relations with India, investment in the UK and philanthropy. But his genteel personal brand was damaged by a bitter dispute with Cyrus Mistry, his successor as group chair.\n\nMistry was a fellow member of the tight-knit business community of Parsees \u2014 descendants of Persian Zoroastrians who migrated to the subcontinent between the eighth and 10th centuries. He was abruptly ousted in a boardroom coup in 2016.\n\nMistry accused Tata of a catalogue of governance failures including having abused his position as chair of the Tata Trusts, a philanthropic trust that owns the majority stake in Tata Group holding company Tata Sons.\u00a0Mistry claimed Tata had interfered in the running of Tata Sons, an allegation he denied.\n\nIn a drawn-out legal and media battle that sullied the group\u2019s reputation, the family patriarch was ultimately the winner, vindicated by a Supreme Court ruling in 2021. Bad blood remained between the conjoined houses of Tata and Mistry \u2014 the latter still owns 18 per cent of Tata Sons \u2014 and Ratan Tata did not offer any public condolence when Mistry died in a car accident in 2022, aged 54.\n\nAn animal lover who famously ordered that stray dogs be allowed to lounge in the lobby of the Tata headquarters in Mumbai, Tata never married and had no children.\n\n\u201cIf I had a family, I could not have spent as much of my time involved with the group. And, things would be very different, in terms of eating, sleeping, living for your job,\u201d he told the FT just before his 2012 retirement as group chair.\n\nWhile the overseas expansion he led was at times messy, it created what is now one of India\u2019s most outward-looking and modern corporate forces.\n\nChandrasekaran, the group\u2019s current chair and the first not related to the founder by family or marriage, has said he had to \u201cstop the bleeding\u201d at its debt-laden companies. But Tata is now at the forefront of business in India across a range of sectors from electric vehicles to renewable energy.\n\nMukesh Ambani, head of the rival conglomerate Reliance Industries, said Tata\u2019s death was \u201ca big loss, not just to the Tata Group, but to every Indian\u201d. \u201cRatan Tata was a visionary industrialist and a philanthropist, who always strove for society\u2019s greater good,\u201d Ambani said.\n\n\u201cI would hope that people would say that I was able to lead the group with dignity and that I tried to do the right thing,\u201d Tata said in 2012 of his legacy. \u201cYou never succeed, having that said, because you always have upset somebody or another, but I think that\u2019s what I would like to be remembered for.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5a405ffe-e9ef-4ebf-9203-ce2283f6d203"}}, {"id": "7e7d931d-ef14-4a7a-84f4-676c76064c21", "event_name": "India denounces \u2018stifling\u2019 EU carbon tax on imports", "blurb": "Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says tariffs to be imposed in 2026 will impede energy transition ", "date": "2024-10-0900:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has denounced the EU\u2019s planned carbon tax on imports as an arbitrary \u201ctrade barrier\u201d that will hurt the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy and other industrialising nations.\n\nSitharaman said the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), under which tariffs are to be levied from 2026, would impede developing countries\u2019 transition away from fossil fuels by making the change harder to fund.\n\n\u201cThey are unilateral and are not helpful,\u201d Sitharaman told the Financial Times\u2019 Energy Transition Summit India in New Delhi. \u201cAbsolutely, it is a trade barrier.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are being stifled by steps which are not going to facilitate the green transition,\u201d she added.\n\nThe CBAM is intended to penalise embedded carbon emissions from the production of goods imported to the EU such as cement, fertilisers, iron and steel, and chemicals. The tax, which was approved last year, has triggered alarm among India\u2019s fast-growing heavy industries, which fear it could wipe out one of their biggest markets.\n\nA report by the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment estimated the CBAM would result in an additional 25 per cent tax on carbon-intensive goods exported from India to the EU, a burden that at 2022-23 levels would be equivalent to 0.05 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP.\n\nIndia relies on coal for more than half of its electricity generation and to directly power much of its production of goods, such as steel.\n\nNew Delhi has also been riled by a controversial EU anti-deforestation law that will block foreign companies from exporting to the bloc if their products are deemed to have contributed to forest loss.\n\nAfter widespread international criticism of the deforestation law, which was meant to enter into force in December, Brussels last week proposed a one-year delay to its implementation.\n\nSitharaman said India was on track to be a net zero carbon emitter by 2070, barring \u201cunilateral\u201d external challenges, such as the EU carbon tariff and deforestation initiatives.\n\n\u201cThat is another one of those steps which can hurt countries like India,\u201d she said of the deforestation rules. \u201cYou will have major disruptions in the supply chain, that\u2019s not going to help countries spending a lot on transition costs.\u201d\n\nUnder the CBAM, exporters to the EU must register the emissions produced in creating their products, with charges kicking in from 2026. The EU is confident the measure would survive a possible challenge at the World Trade Organization because it applies to domestic producers as well as imports.\n\nSitharaman said India had raised concerns with the EU \u201cseveral times\u201d and would do so again, but that she did not expect the issue to affect ongoing free trade negotiations with the bloc.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be escalated to the level of hurting the talks,\u201d the finance minister added. \u201cBut our concerns will definitely be voiced.\u201d\n\nIgnacio Garcia Bercero, non-resident fellow at the Breugel think-tank in Brussels, said the EU measures were being taken to meet the global challenge of climate change and damage to nature, not for protectionist reasons.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to meet internationally agreed global goals to stop deforestation unless importing countries contribute. Europe does not produce most of these commodities so it is not protectionist,\u201d he said.\n\nOn CBAM, Bercero said the EU\u2019s heavy industry was paying more for emissions and without the tariff would simply be forced out of business by cheaper imports from countries without a carbon tax.\n\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO director-general, told the FT last month that global carbon pricing was necessary, but that poorer countries should pay less.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/40648adc-b621-41a3-958a-dd038c811986"}}, {"id": "5b8f1917-7b9d-49f4-a792-8d1b63791714", "event_name": "The battle to build India\u2019s military jet engines", "blurb": "New Delhi will soon recruit a western partner to produce its first world-class jet engine. The decision will be fraught with geopolitical implications", "date": "2024-10-0900:00:00.0", "body": "In the 1990s, when India was pursuing economic reforms, testing nuclear weapons and raising its profile internationally, its defence establishment began work on a homegrown military jet engine: the Kaveri, named after a river in the country\u2019s south.\n\nFor a nation where self-reliance in industry is a mantra of both Narendra Modi\u2019s government and those that preceded it, the ability to develop and build such powerful technology on its own soil \u2014 referred to in India as an \u201cindigenous\u201d product \u2014 is one of its biggest dreams.\n\nBut producing advanced fighter jet engines is a complex process and the knowledge to make them requires real-world experience built up over decades. Only five countries \u2014 notably the current permanent members of the UN Security Council \u2014 know how to build them: the US, UK, France, Russia and China. Beijing, however, is just moving from a reliance on imported equipment from Russia and only recently test flew a fighter jet with a supposedly homegrown engine.\n\nIndia was eager to join the elite club. But despite years of research, prototyping and testing, the Kaveri flopped. India had failed to produce an engine with sufficient thrust to power its current generation of Tejas light combat aircraft. Instead, it plans to use a version of the Kaveri in future unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones.\n\nYet India\u2019s mission to build an \u201cindigenous\u201d military jet engine is back on. What it learned from its work on the Kaveri, not least its mistakes, may yet bear fruit. According to Indian defence industry officials, foreign diplomats and analysts, the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy is in an advanced stage of deliberations on producing its first world-class \u201cMade in India\u201d jet engine, working with a western partner that is yet to be decided.\n\nWhile the foreign partner would bring its technological experience, the engine would be wholly developed and built in India \u2014 making it the first truly \u201cindigenous\u201d product of its kind. Once complete, the engine would be fitted into India\u2019s new suite of fifth-generation advanced fighter aircraft due to be airborne by the mid-2030s.\n\nA behind-the-scenes battle is now heating up, involving lobbying, horse-trading, and pledges about future ownership of intellectual property, to become the aerospace partner of choice for the world\u2019s most populous country.\n\nJostling for the lucrative contract to help India fulfil its ambitions are three key players: General Electric of the US, the UK\u2019s Rolls-Royce, and French group Safran. France and the US are already India\u2019s second and third-biggest defence suppliers after Russia, whose aircraft and other military equipment India is diversifying away from.\n\nWhich partner New Delhi chooses would be freighted with geopolitical implications. It comes at a time when India\u2019s international ambitions are rising, its military rivalry with China is deepening, its relationship with the US is expanding and the Modi government is aspiring to join the world\u2019s top tables, including the UN Security Council.\n\nOn the table for the three companies \u2014 and the governments backing them \u2014 is a decades-long partnership across both defence and civil industries with a fast-growing economy, one that will depend on imported knowhow and kit for years to come.\n\n\u201cPart of the attraction is simply one of scale,\u201d says Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cIndia will over time require considerable numbers of aircraft as the air force looks to recapitalise combat aircraft fleets.\u201d\n\nIndia, says Philippe Errera, executive vice-president of international and public affairs at Safran, is \u201chugely important\u201d for the group, \u201cbased on the present and looking into the future\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis goes beyond military jet engines, to include defence more broadly but also commercial engines,\u201d he adds.\n\nLast year, India managed to land an uncrewed spacecraft near the Moon\u2019s south pole. But despite years of trying, it has yet to develop a viable, advanced military jet engine.\n\nDeveloping an engine large and powerful enough for a civil jet is already extremely complex, analysts say. It relies on knowledge built up over decades, including which materials to use and why and on how to integrate the different parts.\n\nA military jet engine that is capable of delivering world-class performance on a consistent basis brings with it an extra set of challenges, given the higher speeds and tolerances involved. This helps explain why more countries have nuclear weapons capability than the technology needed to keep a fighter jet in the air.\n\nWhile large civil engines need to maximise fuel efficiency, military jet engines are about the amount of power an engine can produce in relation to weight of the aircraft, analysts say. \u201cNo other form of power apart from nuclear comes close to the level of power density you get in a gas turbine,\u201d says one industry expert, who asked not be named because of the sensitivities around discussing large military deals.\n\nCivil airliners fly predictable route patterns and spend much of their time at cruising altitude; military jets have to fly at much higher speeds and with the ability to accelerate quickly. This means, for example, that the bearings in the gas turbine have to be developed to withstand greater tolerances. The engines also use afterburners, which provide a short burst of increased thrust by igniting additional fuel in its exhaust stream.\n\nComplicating things further, most fifth-generation fighters \u2014 like the one being mooted by India \u2014 will have their engines embedded within the aircraft frame to minimise their radar and infrared signatures to help avoid detection. All these complexities extend the development and certification programme for military engines.\n\n\u201cIndia has a technology bottleneck which it has to pass through with gas turbines,\u201d says Prasobh Narayanan, a senior aviation analyst at Janes in Bengaluru. \u201cIt is not able to crack that bottleneck on its own, and needs help.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s efforts to develop the Kaveri in the 1990s came at a time of acute strategic challenges, after the Soviet Union \u2014 its biggest military supplier \u2014 collapsed. New Delhi was also at loggerheads with Washington over its nuclear weapons programme, and began developing military ties with alternative suppliers such as France.\n\nThe situation today is far different. India has reconciled with the US and over the past two years the two nations have expanded co-operation in defence and technology. This partially reflects a shift in India\u2019s threat perception; it now sees China, and not its neighbour and long-standing foe Pakistan, as the bigger danger.\n\nSince Modi took power in 2014, he has stepped up efforts to bring foreign defence groups to India and promote more \u201cindigenous\u201d production in defence, urging private groups such as Tata, Adani and Mahindra to begin making defence products ranging from personnel carriers to drones.\n\nHowever, the entry of these Indian conglomerates to the defence market over the past decade have failed to make up for the failings of its state-owned groups, led by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), India\u2019s biggest aerospace producer. India\u2019s Defence Research and Development Organisation and HAL are set to be the Indian partner in developing the new jet engine. HAL and India\u2019s ministry of defence did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIndia abandoned plans for a \u201cMake in India\u201d project to produce French Rafale jets locally, opting instead to buy 36 imported jets in 2016. Today India also remains its biggest defence importer \u2014 not a point of pride for a country that aspires to boost its own industrial exports and create desperately needed jobs. China is going to be \u201cincreasingly active in the combat aircraft export market and with its own rather than Russian-sourced engines\u201d, says Barrie of the IISS. But he believes Beijing is unlikely to compete in traditional western markets.\n\nThe world\u2019s large aero-engine makers have been active in India for decades, forging partnerships with domestic contractors and setting up local manufacturing. Engines by Rolls-Royce powered the first flight of the Indian Air Force in 1933, while Safran is the leading supplier of turbine engines for the country\u2019s military helicopters.\n\nAfter the Kaveri engine failed to meet performance criteria, HAL turned to GE engines, and uses the US producer\u2019s F404 models in its first-generation Mk1 fighters.\n\nDuring Modi\u2019s state visit to Washington last year, GE announced it was ready to supply India with its newer F414 engines for the forthcoming Tejas Mk2. The agreement includes the potential joint production of the F414 engines in India.\n\nGE signalled at the time that it believed that this positioned it well for future work. The US company said it would continue to \u201ccollaborate with the Indian government\u201d on the engine programme for the more advanced fighter.\n\nIndia\u2019s commitment to building its own military jet engine is backed by significant funding. In March, its Cabinet Committee on Security approved funding worth $1.8bn for the manufacturing, testing and certifying of five prototypes for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft programme over the next five years.\n\nIndian officials have spoken of inducting the planned jet into the Indian Air Force by the early to mid-2030s, leading to speculation among defence analysts in the country that it will soon decide who its partner on the \u201cindigenous\u201d jet engine will be.\n\nRolls-Royce and Safran each insist that they are ready to work with HAL, the state-owned aerospace firm, to co-develop a bespoke engine that would entail a full transfer of intellectual property to India, including the right to include it in future exports.\n\nBritain\u2019s Rolls-Royce has emphasised its long history in India, which stretches back more than 90 years and involves multiple partnerships across its divisions.\n\n\u201cWhat we are talking about is a gear change,\u201d says Alex Zino, director of future programmes for Rolls-Royce\u2019s defence division. \u201cNow is the time to co-create that IP and that capability in-country, so that it is owned in-country.\u201d\n\nIndia, Zino says, would have the freedom to operate, upgrade or modify the co-developed engine, should they partner. Rolls-Royce has been working on its proposal \u201cthrough and with the UK government\u201d, he confirms.\n\nSafran, too, is promising India similar freedoms to own any engine technology it and HAL co-develop. The French company\u2019s proposal would give India \u201cstrategic independence in terms of empowering the country to design, develop and produce state of the art military jet engines domestically and export them\u201d, says Errera, the Safran executive.\n\nGE\u2019s offer, by contrast, would withhold a small portion of the IP on any future co-developed jet engine, according to two people familiar with its plans. \u201cSome things the US, from a national security perspective, might want to retain,\u201d says one of the people. GE declined to comment.\n\nSome US officials remain wary of India\u2019s continued close relationship with Russia, analysts say, meaning Washington and GE might be less willing to part ways with coveted technology in its entirety. Although India and the US are co-operating more closely than ever, including on defence, New Delhi retains ties and trading relationships with not only Moscow but other governments, such as Tehran, that are inimical to Washington.\n\nWorking in GE\u2019s favour, however, is geopolitics and India\u2019s deepening relationship with the US \u2014 part of a joint strategy to build an \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d bulwark against China. India is already deploying multiple US defence platforms, including helicopters, howitzers, and mobility aircraft, and is in the process of agreeing a major contract for long-endurance UAVs with General Atomics.\n\n\u201cI think the American offer is the most serious one,\u201d says Amit Cowshish, a retired senior civil servant formerly active in India\u2019s defence ministry. \u201cThe Americans could possibly be pushing harder with the kind of clout they have, which is much more than that of any other country.\u201d\n\nFrance has made an appeal based on its own burgeoning relationship with New Delhi. Safran employs just under 3,000 people in India \u2014 a number it says will grow as it expands its operations there. The French group, in which the government holds an 11 per cent share, plans to open a maintenance facility in the aerospace and tech hub of Hyderabad, a city in southern India\u2019s Telangana state, next year. The site will support the Leap engines Safran makes through its CFM International, a joint venture with GE Aerospace, and which power the majority of the Airbus A320 family of commercial jets.\n\n\u201cWe have stood by your side through thick and thin,\u201d Safran\u2019s chair Ross McInnes assured an audience at India\u2019s Defence Conclave earlier this month. \u201cThe same cannot be said of your other western partners,\u201d he added, noting that France was the only western country that stood with India after the uproar over its nuclear tests in 1998.\n\nErrera echoes the point, saying there is \u201cmore predictability and more stability in the relationship\u201d with France than with its rivals. And unlike the US, where Congress needs to sign off on big defence deals, the French government could green light any future co-operation.\n\nIndia\u2019s government and HAL have given no indication of when they will issue the first \u201crequest for information\u201d to potential engine partners.\n\nAlthough India\u2019s state-dominated defence establishment tends to move slowly, and with limited transparency, analysts and officials say New Delhi will need to quicken its pace if it wants to keep up on defence.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t make the decision, soon they will be missing the deadline\u201d for a decision on their engine programme, says Raji Pillai, resident senior fellow with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a Canberra-based think-tank. \u201cIndia\u2019s fighter jet numbers are depleting pretty fast.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f007cf0c-1e00-4ddc-bc3c-59aad46728ea"}}, {"id": "d2500164-47f9-43be-95eb-96fefad68269", "event_name": "India\u2019s belated oil rush", "blurb": "India hurries to extract oil before the sun sets on the fossil fuel industry", "date": "2024-10-0900:00:00.0", "body": "The head of KPMG US says the industry urgently needs to make it easier to become an accountant, and the EU is suing Hungary\u2019s government over a new security law it says is in breach of citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.

And if you strike oil and you are a partner, you will have first right of refusal,\u201d Puri added.\n\nThe minister said India had \u201cseveral\u201d oilfields the size of ExxonMobil\u2019s 11bn barrel discovery in Guyana waiting to be found and that the country needed to move quickly to tap them before the world switched to other forms of energy in order to hit net zero climate targets.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s a race,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it remains there unexploited, when the [energy] transition becomes total, there is a philosophical debate on that. I keep telling Guyana, you got a big find, but by the time the oil starts coming into the market, the transition already would be in a pretty advanced stage.\u201d\n\nThe Indian minister\u2019s remarks appear to signal that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government intends to make up for lost time in offshore oil exploration and production, where some investment has been deterred by fluctuating regulations and persistent red tape.\n\nEstimates of India\u2019s potential oil wealth differ hugely. S&P Global Commodity Insights believes there may be as much as 22bn barrels of oil in unexplored basins. Rystad, an energy consultancy, puts the figure at just under 8bn.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at the International Energy Agency are pessimistic about the chances of a significant increase in the country\u2019s 700,000 barrels per day of production.\n\n\u201cIn part, the absence of international companies may be due to lacklustre discoveries since the turn of the century,\u201d they wrote, in their annual Indian Oil Market outlook. Over the past 23 years, 2bn barrels of oil have been discovered in India, compared with 10bn in each of Angola, Norway and Guyana and 40bn in Brazil.\n\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop of capital discipline, major players may be waiting on the sidelines for a world-class find before establishing operations in the country,\u201d they added.\n\nPuri, who promised in July more than $100bn of investment opportunities in the sector by 2030, is trying to reduce India\u2019s overwhelming dependence on imported oil.\n\n\u201cWe just took our eye off the ball. There was neglect,\u201d he said. Only 10 per cent of India\u2019s potentially oil-producing basins were being explored, while the country imported 85 per cent to 88 per cent of its oil and spent $150bn a year on foreign energy resources, Puri said.\n\nTo trigger more oil exploration, he said he would radically change India\u2019s legal framework. \u201cWe sat down with the majors and said: \u2018Look, guys, tell us which are the areas where you want tweaking in policy?\u2019 In the next session [of parliament], which will be fully next month, I will get that bill passed and it will be enacted into law,\u201d he said.\n\nThe proposed legislation reforms regulation of oilfield development to protect companies against sudden windfall taxes and gives them the right to arbitrate any disputes outside India, among other changes.\n\nPuri said India had also opened more than a million square kilometres that were previously \u201cno-go areas\u201d because of military or other restrictions, and had put \u201call the data which people require\u201d on a repository at the University of Texas in Houston.\n\nBP, Reliance and Vedanta were among the companies that submitted bids this year in India\u2019s ninth licensing round, for nine onshore blocks, eight shallow-water blocks and 11 ultra-deepwater blocks. Puri said 38 per cent of the bids were for areas that were previously restricted.\n\nForeign oil companies are hoping India\u2019s status as one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing big economies will underpin future demand for crude. \u201cIndia is growing and looks very, very healthy,\u201d said Darren Woods, chief executive of ExxonMobil, at the company\u2019s last results call.\n\n\u201cIndia is where the real growth is going to come, so it has an underlying advantage,\u201d said Puri.

But in written remarks issued through his office ahead of his arrival in India, Muizzu described India as \u201cour closest neighbour, with whom we share deep historical, cultural and economic ties\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s proximity and long-standing support have been pivotal in the Maldives\u2019 development and stability,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Maldives\u2019 net or usable foreign exchange reserves fell to about $36mn in September, the country\u2019s monetary authority said on Monday, underscoring the depth of a crisis facing the dollar-pegged rufiyaa currency.\n\nThe swaps would be \u201cinstrumental in tackling the ongoing financial challenges faced by the Maldives\u201d, Modi\u2019s office said after his meeting with Muizzu.\n\nIndia has already rolled over $100mn of short-term dollar loans to the Maldives this year, allowing the country to make an interest payment this month on a $500mn Islamic sukuk that comes due next year.\n\nInvestors had worried that the Maldives would be the first country to default on a sukuk, a form of debt that follows Islamic strictures against interest.\n\nMuizzu this year told India to withdraw its small military contingent from the islands, a force that mostly helped in medical evacuations and maritime surveillance.\n\nMuizzu also alarmed India by paying one of his first foreign visits as president to China \u2014 New Delhi\u2019s biggest regional rival. However, the Maldives and India have since reconciled and civilian personnel have replaced the soldiers.\n\nMuizzu said the Maldives had also \u201ccultivated a robust relationship with China\u201d, which he described as \u201cone of our top development partners\u201d, including through projects under Beijing\u2019s flagship global infrastructure programme, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nLast month the state-owned State Bank of India agreed to lend $50mn to the Maldives, days before it faced a roughly $25mn coupon payment on the sukuk.\n\n\u201cGiven its ambitions of being a net security provider in the Indian Ocean, India has no way of turning away the Maldives,\u201d said Indrani Bagchi, chief executive of the Ananta Centre, a New Delhi-based think-tank.\n\n\u201cThere has also been a better realisation of the actual role India plays inside the Maldives, including a fairly large humanitarian role \u2014 something which cannot be replicated by any other power,\u201d Bagchi said.\n\nThe Maldives\u2019 foreign exchange reserves fell to critically low levels after its tourism economy was battered by Covid-19 travel restrictions and debt ballooned because of high spending on infrastructure projects and imports.\n\nThe country\u2019s sukuk maturing in 2026 plummeted to trade at 70 cents on the dollar last month over investor fears of a sovereign default. They rose 0.4 per cent to 80 cents on the dollar following Monday\u2019s bailout news.\n\nWary of Chinese influence in its backyard, India has sought to assist regional neighbours suffering economic difficulties.

The votes will be counted and results announced on Tuesday.\n\nWrapping up a peaceful election would represent a public relations coup for India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata party, which says it has brought peace to Jammu and Kashmir since downgrading what was India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state to a union territory under direct federal rule.\n\n\u201cThe peaceful and participative elections are historic wherein democracy is taking root\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009driven by the will of the people of Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d said Rajiv Kumar, India\u2019s chief election commissioner, as voting closed.\n\nModi\u2019s government five years ago revoked a constitutional article that guaranteed significant regional autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nUnlike past regional elections, which were subject to boycott campaigns by Kashmiri separatists, this vote was marked by vigorous campaigning and strong participation by large national parties, smaller regional rivals and independent candidates.\n\nTo ensure order during voting, which was carried out in phases beginning last month, paramilitaries in security vehicles mounted with guns patrolled towns that have previously been hotbeds of Kashmiri separatist militancy.\n\nOpposition politicians have accused New Delhi of ruling the disputed region by fear and oppression. After downgrading the state, the government blocked the internet there for months and carried out mass arrests of separatists, activists and others.\n\n\u201cThe BJP\u2019s jackboot policy has created fear,\u201d said Tariq Hameed Karra, Jammu and Kashmir president of the Indian National Congress, India\u2019s biggest opposition party. \u201cThere\u2019s anger in every part of the state over the legal, constitutional, cultural, religious and economic oppression of the people.\u201d\n\nPeople were \u201cnot allowed to air their grievances\u201d, he said.\n\nIltija Mufti, a candidate for the regional People\u2019s Democratic party, which wants restoration of statehood and autonomy, said the Modi government had \u201cdisempowered and dispossessed\u201d people in the territory.\n\nWhile deadly encounters between Indian security forces and insurgents remain common, the number of people killed has fallen, according to security analysts.\n\nThey said this was in part because Pakistan, which backs Kashmiri separatism, had in the past few years been focused more on Afghanistan and on its own economic problems, according to Ajai Sahni, executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cThere is a very sustained downward trend in fatalities because of improvements in Indian security force capabilities and a weakening of the economy and security force capacity in Pakistan,\u201d Sahni said.\n\nAccording to the institute\u2019s South Asian Terrorism Portal, 134 fatalities among Indian security forces, insurgents and civilians were reported in the region in 2023, down from an average of well over 1,000 per year at the height of the conflict from 1990-2006.\n\nIn Sopore, a town in lush northern Kashmir, farm workers took time off from the harvest season to queue early at a polling station surrounded by willow trees used to make cricket bats.\n\nMohammad Ramzan Ganai, 78, a supporter of Kashmir\u2019s oldest party, the National Conference, said people wanted elected representatives who would defend their basic interests, including seeking the restoration of the territory\u2019s statehood and autonomy. \u201cThis vote is different because we want our basic rights back,\u201d Ganai said.\n\nWhile the election will allow some transfer of power to a 90-seat regional assembly, Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s status as a union territory means New Delhi will have much more direct control than it does in Indian states.\n\nBringing Kashmir under the same regime as India\u2019s other states has long been a pet project for the BJP. But while Modi has voiced support for restoring statehood, the party has dismissed any suggestion it could give Jammu and Kashmir back substantial autonomy and the special rights previously granted to people defined as permanent residents.\n\nAnalysts said New Delhi\u2019s direct rule by handpicked bureaucrats had left a gap in public representation. \u201cPeople feel a disconnect with governance,\u201d said Nisar Ali, an economist on a central government data committee. \u201cTheir motivation is to elect local representatives so that they can access government services through them.\u201d\n\nIntense development of roads and other infrastructure over the past five years has converted swaths of the picturesque mountainous territory into construction sites.

Wood Mackenzie expects cell manufacturing in countries outside of the main hubs of China and south-east Asia to more than double over the next couple of years, with India making up 40 per cent of new capacity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no modular manufacturer in India who is not thinking of exporting,\u201d said Subrahmanyam Pulipaka, chief executive of the National Solar Energy Federation of India, a lobbying group that counts big developers such as Adani Group, Tata Power and ReNew among its members.\n\nUS imports of Indian panels and cells surpassed $1.8bn last year, up from about $250mn the year before, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nIndian manufacturers are also investing in US factories following President Joe Biden\u2019s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, which included lucrative subsidies for domestic producers, with Waaree and VSK Energy announcing manufacturing commitments worth at least $1bn each last year.\n\n\u201cThe main advantage is that they\u2019re not Chinese,\u201d said Martin Pochtaruk, chief executive of Heliene, which operates a solar panel factory in Minnesota.\n\nThe company used to source its cells from Vietnam and Malaysia, but now purchases primarily from India to insulate itself from new tariffs. In July, Heliene announced a $150mn joint venture with Premier Energies, India\u2019s second-largest solar cell manufacturer, to build a US factory.\n\nThe Biden administration has raised protections against solar imports with ties to Beijing, doubling the duty rate for Chinese cells, applying anti-circumvention tariffs on Chinese companies in south-east Asia, and banning goods linked to forced labour in Xinjiang. The White House also maintained Trump-era tariffs that applied to solar products from most countries.\n\nDespite the efforts, US imports of panels sit at record highs. Several manufacturers, including VSK Energy, have delayed or scrapped their US manufacturing plans despite the availability of federal tax credits.\n\n\u201cTariffs haven\u2019t worked,\u201d said Pol Lezcano, a senior analyst at BloombergNEF.\n\n\u201cManufacturers don\u2019t come to the US. They don\u2019t really find the right business and supply chain environment that they need to scale up manufacturing.\u201d\n\nRapidly declining prices for imported panels have helped transform solar into the leading source of new power on the US grid. The Energy Information Administration expects solar installations this year to grow 42 per cent, reaching 127 gigawatts.\n\nIn April, the largest US solar manufacturers, First Solar and Qcells, and others filed a petition for tariffs on cells to be applied to four countries in south-east Asia in order to rescue a struggling domestic industry.\n\nLuigi Resta, president of rPlus Energies, a developer, warned that the tariffs would slow down the pace of deployment and raise prices for consumers. The company has started to source from Indonesia, another emerging solar manufacturing market, to safeguard it against trade impacts.\n\n\u201cThe nature of the industry is that we have to be very flexible,\u201d Resta said. The company now sources about 1GW of panels between Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nIndustry executives and analysts expressed concern that plans to build production lines in tariff-exempt markets may lead the US government to play a game of \u201cWhac-A-Mole\u201d with tariffs and fine those countries in the future, risking billions in capital expenditure.\n\n\u201cIf too many people go to one place, it just ruins it for everybody,\u201d said Jim Wood, chief executive of SEG Solar.\n\nLast week the company broke ground on a $500mn factory near Jakarta, which will help supply cells to its panel factory in Texas.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/78f52ebd-13ba-4a38-843a-c156f2415e8b"}}, {"id": "4b1c665d-eefb-4ee5-b19c-de1856f9a689", "event_name": "Collector Kiran Nadar on Indian art and building museums  ", "blurb": "Her 15,000 artworks range from the Bombay Progressives to Olafur Eliasson and Anish Kapoor ", "date": "2024-10-0500:00:00.0", "body": "\u201cI never had any formal art training: I just learnt as I went along,\u201d says Indian collector and philanthropist Kiran Nadar.

And then I bought a graphic male nude, \u201cRunners\u201d (1982), by Rameshwar Broota \u2014 my husband was horrified! I was a bit crestfallen and told him we had to go to the studio and apologise [for changing our minds], but when he met the artist he said I was right to have the painting. And it is in his study to this day.\u201d\n\nBut it was only after buying work by Manjit Bawa that she became \u201cgalvanised\u201d: \u201cI never really thought I was collecting, just acquiring. But then it reached a stage that we had no more wall space and I was just putting them into storage. It wasn\u2019t even formalised storage, it was in the basement. I realised it was a bit futile to leave them like that.\n\nBy 2010 she had acquired 500 works, so she decided to create a space to show them, the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA) \u2014 initially on the HCL campus in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, then in South Court Mall in New Delhi, supported by the Shiv Nadar Foundation. A vast new museum, designed by Adjaye Associates, will open on a 100,000-square-metre site directly across from the Indira Gandhi international airport in New Delhi in 2026 or 2027.\n\nI ask her about the choice of the Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye for her new museum. Since that decision was taken in 2019, Adjaye has been accused of sexual assault, sexual harassment and promoting a toxic work culture according to an investigation in the Financial Times last year, allegations which he has denied.\n\n\u201cThe choice [of Adjaye] was made by a jury\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009which whittled applicants to six, out of the initial 60.

That\u2019s the way it stands today.\u201d\n\nWhile her collecting focus was on works by the Bombay Progressive Artists\u2019 Group, a Mumbai-based collective of artists synthesising Indian art history and European Modernism from 1947, she also bought contemporary art: \u201cI bought at huge prices. Then the crash came and even today some of the works haven\u2019t reached what I paid for them at that time.\u201d That \u201ccrash\u201d, specifically in Indian art, took place in 2006-07 and was fuelled by speculation and the creation of art funds. Prices continued to fall over the next few years, in some cases, as she says, never to recover.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keen that Indian art gets more international recognition,\u201d she says. KNMA part-funded the Indian pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2019 (only the second time the country has staged one) and this year organised a retrospective of MF Husain there. \u201cIndia is such an important country. Every country has a pavilion [at the Biennale] and so should we; if there is no space in the Giardini, there must be another important space [the Biennale organisers] can give us. I think at the next Biennale, India will have its own space.\u201d\n\nAs well as Indian art, Nadar\u2019s collection includes western names: she mentions Antony Gormley, Olafur Eliasson and William Kentridge, as well as South Asian diaspora artists such as Shahzia Sikander, Anish Kapoor and Raqib Shaw.\n\nArt isn\u2019t her only passion. \u201cI\u2019m actually very multi-dimensional!\u201d she exclaims, waving a hand in the air. She is one of India\u2019s foremost bridge players and will represent her country at the World Bridge Games in Buenos Aires this year.\n\nI bring the conversation back to the future of her collection. \u201cFor the moment it is funded by the foundation, but there will be an endowment. I can\u2019t be here for ever, and I can\u2019t leave it in hands where it\u2019s not going to serve: we will make sure it will be very, very professional.\u201d\n\n\u2018The Imaginary Institution of India: Art 1975-1998\u2019 runs to January 5, barbican.org.uk", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/09d5a41c-0da4-4fdb-a6d0-d235cb13c296"}}, {"id": "342ab3de-0ab2-4159-b4a1-a5422441ffce", "event_name": "India is getting serious about wine. What will that mean?", "blurb": "The latest hobby enjoyed by affluent Indians might give producers reason to be cheerful", "date": "2024-10-0500:00:00.0", "body": "When I arrived in India for a few days recently, I was puzzled by Indian consumers\u2019 and producers\u2019 attachment to powerful reds. The country\u2019s most celebrated wine, J\u2019Noon, is a blockbuster if ever there was one. Surely, in India\u2019s sultry climate, the refreshment of whites and ros\u00e9s is needed, or at least a lighter red such as a Pinot Noir?\n\nWhen, for the third night running, I got back to my hotel room shivering from the aggressive air conditioning during dinner, the penny dropped. Wine in India is becoming increasingly common, but it\u2019s the drink of the well-off and the well-off are devoted to fiendish air con. Perhaps they need those full-bodied reds to warm themselves up?\n\nDespite punitive import duties of 150 per cent by value, and complex regulations and taxes that differ state by state (some of which are dry), wine has steadily been replacing cocktails and whisky among affluent Indians.\n\nDuring my time in Delhi and Mumbai I was told that many Indian drinkers believe that red wine is good for their health. The World Health Organization may disagree but the burgeoning Indian wine trade is not minded to draw their customers\u2019 attention to this. And the theory that India\u2019s highly spiced food doesn\u2019t go with wine has largely been abandoned.\n\nWe enjoyed a range of wines carrying nine of India\u2019s most respected labels with the excellent Indian cuisine of Masque restaurant in Mumbai\u2019s old mill district, the fashionably grungy equivalent of east London or Brooklyn. This was at a special dinner organised by India\u2019s one and only Master of Wine, Sonal Holland. The wines had improved considerably since my last visit in 2017.\n\nHridhay Mehra, Masque\u2019s head sommelier, confirmed the cultural hurdles that wine has had to overcome in many sectors of Indian society. \u201cIt took ages for me to convince my parents that I drink for a living. I used to have to hide bottles of wine in my bedroom cupboard,\u201d he told me. A few days later, back in London, I was to meet a young Indian-born wine writer who emigrated to America with her parents as a teenager. Her mother, a keen wine drinker, still drinks it out of a cup rather than a more revealing glass, she said.\n\nThe Masque dinner was the first time these nine producers had met socially. Holland asked them each to provide one wine and found, perhaps inevitably, that most of them wanted to show a full-bodied red. A notable exception was the LVMH-owned sparkling-wine producer Chandon, which provided our sparkling ros\u00e9 aperitif made in the same way as its stablemate in Champagne, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. But even this definitively effervescent company has just launched a still red, Aurva Shiraz 2021, under a screwcap.\n\nShiraz is the most-prized variety of winegrape in India and does well in the heartland of Indian viticulture, Nashik, a four-hour drive north-east of Mumbai. Cabernet Sauvignon does better in Solapur, seven hours to the south-east of Mumbai, where the nights are warmer. Chenin Blanc is the most popular grape for white wines.\n\nThere is now a Wine Growers of India association, encouraged by Ashwin Rodrigues, owner and chief winemaker of Good Earth Wine, who gained his winemaking experience in the Barossa Valley. He excitedly told me that the association now holds technical meetings \u201cfor winemakers, not CEOs\u201d at which they serve each others\u2019 wines blind and comment on them, all in aid of improving the quality of Indian wine overall.\n\nHe was seated at our table at this dinner, and I heard him ask Ipsita Das, managing director of Mo\u00ebt Hennessy India, why she recently raised the price of Chandon quite substantially, to the equivalent of about \u00a325 a bottle. \u201cWe thought India was ready for a premium wine,\u201d she answered with a careful smile, before admitting, \u201cIt has been a tough journey.\u201d As a fellow Indian wine producer trying to balance the books, Rodrigues expressed deep gratitude for her move, although a more cynical diner at our table observed, \u201cIndians are still learning to drink sparkling water, let alone sparkling wine.\u201d\n\nPer capita consumption of wine may have risen in recent years, but it\u2019s still not much more than two centilitres a year. Although, as one wine professional pointed out, \u201cIf we all consumed wine, there\u2019d be none left for anyone else in the world\u201d. This seems unlikely, given the extreme poverty experienced by so many Indians, but a report from research group IWSR on prospects for alcoholic drinks identified India as the country with the greatest volume growth last year and one of the few expected to grow in future.\n\nPartly because of those import taxes, 75 per cent of wine sold in India is Indian and Rajeev Samant of Sula Vineyards has a 60 per cent share of that 75 per cent. Inspired by what he saw in California, Samant has been in the business for 25 years. Countless Indians have had their first-ever taste of grape-based wine at Sula\u2019s tourist-focused winery in Nashik, so Samant bears considerable responsibility for the prospects of the Indian wine market. Sula has become so ubiquitous that Samant has been developing other labels such as The Source and R\u0100S\u0100 (another full-bodied red).\n\nBut the really well-heeled drink imported wine. At another dinner, I sat next to one wine lover who commutes between London and Mumbai and told me he always loads up at the Mayfair wine treasure trove Hedonism before travelling back to India and goes gamely, and expensively, through the red channel on arrival.\n\nWhen Holland started out in wine 17 years ago, there were very few Indian wine professionals, but the Indian wine importers I met recently were admirably well informed. I was told that Italian reds, particularly from Tuscany, are currently popular but that the reputation of Bordeaux has been harmed by too many poor-quality wines.\n\nIn another sign of the times, this month sees the establishment of the Sommeliers Association of India by Bordeaux-based Master of Wine hopeful Amrita Singh. There are apparently already 35 to 40 candidates for professional somm exams, and the first Indian qualified as a Master Sommelier in August. Kamal Malik currently works for a wine importer in the Maldives.\n\nThe Indian sommeliers I met were unanimous that more somms are needed in their country, pointing out that there are probably a thousand bartenders for every wine waiter. Supply is hindered by the fact that even top hospitality schools are not allowed to serve alcohol to anyone under 25 \u2014 virtually all their students.\n\nThere may be only 10 Indians resident in India who have reached the top, Diploma, level of Wine & Spirit Education Trust courses, but early evening wine tastings have become a popular leisure activity. Devati Mallick, a young woman who organises them, assured me that when Indians travel, they tend to become interested in wines from the regions they explore.\n\nSusmita Bomzon worked in Dubai before returning to her native India to set up, in 2023, the country\u2019s first wine bar, Captain\u2019s Cellar, in the basement of the Taj Mahal hotel in New Delhi. Thanks to Enomatic wine dispenser cabinets, she offers 48 wines, Indian and imported, by the glass. According to Master of Wine Holland, \u201cFifteen years ago this would have been unthinkable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that Australia, having been crippled by punitive tariffs imposed by China in 2020, decided to look to India for new export opportunities, concluding a trade agreement in 2022. This is one rapidly growing market that gives the world\u2019s wine producers, concerned about shrinking sales elsewhere, some reason to be hopeful.\n\nTasting notes, scores and suggested drink dates on Purple Pages of JancisRobinson.com.

The value of the company plunged, and investors were forced to write off stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nCreditors of Byju\u2019s are now in US courts to locate almost half of a $1.2bn loan, while the company fights insolvency proceedings in India over delayed national cricket authority sponsorship dues. The Qatar Investment Authority has also launched a case in India\u2019s tech hub of Bengaluru, where Byju\u2019s is based, to recover more than $200mn from Raveendran.\n\nByju\u2019s has been unable to access its bank accounts and pay salaries as a result of the Indian legal proceedings, Raveendran said in a company-wide email in August shared with the Financial Times. \u201cI have felt like a man screaming into a hurricane of hurdles,\u201d Raveendran said. \u201cWhen we regain control, your salaries will be paid promptly, even if that means raising more personal debt.\u201d\n\nByju\u2019s, which is now worth $120mn according to data provider Tracxn, has denied wrongdoing. Raveendran told the FT that his company no longer had access to capital and the entirety of the $1.2bn term loan at the heart of the sprawling legal battle with its creditors had been spent.\n\nHe said they had not been able to pay their lawyers in a Delaware court case and that what he described as the company\u2019s \u201cstrategy\u201d of trying to conceal money from creditors \u201chas not gone right\u201d. Raveendran added: \u201cI will fight it out because we will win eventually.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s legal battles from Delaware to Bengaluru have shone a harsh light on start-up corporate governance standards, said Shriram Subramanian, founder of Bengaluru-based proxy advisor InGovern Research Services. \u201cIt\u2019s a big failure of corporate governance from multiple perspectives,\u201d he said.\n\nByju\u2019s overdue accounts released in January showed losses almost doubling to nearly $1bn in the year to March 2022. While the platform still has about 7mn paying users, the number of employees \u2014 more than half of them teachers \u2014 has plunged from about 80,000 at its peak to about 27,000 today, Raveendran said.\n\nSubramanian questioned why investors tolerated Byju\u2019s delayed filing of accounts and pointed out that the company did not have a chief financial officer for 16 months between 2021 and 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Byju\u2019s saga has a general resonance,\u201d Subramanian added. \u201cThere is an element of caution and more scrutiny of start-ups, investors are expecting more due diligence and a path to profitability. No more is there a blind throwing of money.\u201d\n\nTotal annual funding to Indian start-ups was $32bn last year, less than half of the 2020 peak of $67.3bn, according to Tracxn.\n\n\u201cThe different layers of scandal that have draped this company for the last couple of years create a very complex cocktail of issues,\u201d said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, a Singapore-based analyst at Aletheia Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for the tech ecosystem in India.\u201d\n\nA lawsuit launched in Delaware by a group of more than 100 creditors to recover $533mn of the $1.2bn syndicated loan to Byju\u2019s secured in November 2021 has revealed disorganisation at the edtech company.\n\nEarlier this year, Raveendran\u2019s brother Riju struggled to explain to a US judge that he did not know the whereabouts of $533mn of the loan. Riju, who was the sole director of US-based Byju\u2019s Alpha, a company created to receive loans, said in May: \u201cI really don\u2019t know where the money is.\u201d\n\nRiju, who lives with Raveendran and his wife Divya Gokulnath, the company\u2019s husband-and-wife co-founders, in Dubai\u2019s affluent Emirates Hills community, said he had sent emails asking them where the money was.\n\nRaveendran said Riju had not lied as he had restricted information to him.\n\nRiju\u2019s attempts to find the funds \u201cwere tepid at best\u201d and his \u201ctestimony lacks all credibility\u201d, said US bankruptcy judge John Dorsey at the May hearing. The court found him in contempt and in July imposed a fine of $10,000 a day until the money was located.\n\n\u201cI have struggled in my own mind whether we are seeing ineptitude\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009or we\u2019re seeing something more nefarious,\u201d said Ravi Shankar, a Kirkland & Ellis advocate acting for Glas Trust, an agency representing more than 100 Byju\u2019s creditors. \u201cTwo brothers doing whatever it can take to salvage a crumbling empire.\u201d\n\nAfter Byju\u2019s Alpha was accused by the creditors of default, they removed Riju as sole director of the company in 2023 and installed Timothy Pohl, a restructuring expert. Last month, Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court affirmed that default.\n\nPohl unearthed bank accounts that showed transfers signed off by Riju to a little-known Florida-based hedge fund Camshaft Capital. It was set up in 2020 and registered with the address of an IHOP pancake restaurant in Miami by then-23-year-old William Morton, a high school dropout with no investment qualifications.\n\nIn a separate Florida suit, the creditors\u2019 lawyers allege Morton splurged on Ferrari, Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce cars after the Byju\u2019s transfer, as well as a condo with an ocean view with a listed monthly rent of $29,000.\n\nMorton\u2019s lawyers said Camshaft \u201cvigorously denies\u201d the allegations. In June, they told the Delaware court that millions of dollars in fees he received in the deal were \u201cnot with us today\u201d.\n\nEarlier this year, it emerged in court that Camshaft transferred the funds to OCI, a British company. The creditors\u2019 lawyers are now seeking documents about the transfer in UK courts. Morton and OCI did not respond to a request for comment. Raveendran said Camshaft had not lost the company money and declined to comment on OCI.\n\nRiju\u2019s lawyers at the end of July said in court that funds were spent on goods and services for Byju\u2019s and \u201cnot for an improper purpose\u201d. Byju\u2019s has launched a counter-lawsuit in New York against the lenders, accusing them of unfairly accelerating the loan terms and negotiating in \u201cbad faith\u201d.\n\nRaveendran added \u201cthere has never been any fraud\u201d and \u201cnot a single dollar\u201d of the loan was transferred to India or personal accounts.\n\nByju\u2019s faces more legal challenges in India. The Qatar Investment Authority \u2014 the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which invested in the company and loaned Raveendran $250mn in 2022 \u2014 is fighting in a Karnataka court to claim back more than $200mn from him. Raveendran declined to comment on the QIA case.\n\nByju\u2019s was also pushed into bankruptcy proceedings in India by the country\u2019s national cricket authority over unpaid sponsorship dues. Although the company settled the case in August, India\u2019s Supreme Court stayed the settlement order after the US creditors alleged Byju\u2019s might have used money from their loan to pay the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Byju\u2019s has denied the allegation.\n\nThe lenders know that time is not on their side. Earlier this year, they said the cost of recovering the funds could make \u201cfinding the money nothing more than a Pyrrhic victory\u201d.Raveendran said Byju\u2019s would pay back the lenders. \u201cIf they have the patience, come work with me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make a comeback.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8788b2d7-98c1-469b-acbc-fd5fadd97939"}}, {"id": "c5630117-0ae0-488f-aed0-10a6306cf6b8", "event_name": "Indian appetite for Swiss watches grows", "blurb": "Brands increase exports to meet demand from exponentially growing luxury market", "date": "2024-10-0400:00:00.0", "body": "Swiss watch exports have fallen this year, but one market is showing strong growth: India. Exports to the country rose 20 per cent in value, year on year, in the first seven months of 2024 to SFr139.5mn ($165mn), compared with a 2.4 per cent fall globally. And that export value represents a 41.4 per cent increase on the same period in 2022 \u2014 the largest rise recorded by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry for any market, over such a timescale.\n\nNow, a trade deal is set to make watch exports even easier. In March, India signed an agreement with the European Free Trade Association to phase out custom duties on Swiss watches (about 20 per cent) within seven years and give improved protection around the use of the terms \u201cSwiss\u201d or \u201cSwitzerland\u201d.\n\nIndia is, in many ways, an ideal watch market. It was the fastest-growing major economy in last month\u2019s World Bank update, and one in which the number of millionaires (in US dollars) will rise 22 per cent between 2023 and 2028, to 1,061,463, according to the latest UBS Global Wealth Report. The Deloitte Swiss Watch Industry Study 2023 flagged the country as the \u201cnext big growth market\u201d, and found that 94 per cent of Indian consumers wear a watch (in the US, it is 79 per cent).\n\n\u201cAs the population is getting more wealthy and developing, and the luxury market is exponentially growing compared with the consumer market, there\u2019s an upgrade [in the watches people buy],\u201d says Karine Szegedi, consumer industry and fashion and luxury lead at Deloitte Switzerland, and the study\u2019s co-author.\n\nWatchmakers are expanding their retail presence. IWC opened its first boutique in India, at Jio Mall in Mumbai, last November. Then Breitling launched boutiques in Chennai and Pune earlier this year, having opened its first Indian store in Hyderabad in 2023. It plans to have boutiques in each of the country\u2019s top eight to 10 cities.\n\nThis focus comes amid a slump in sales in China, the second-largest export market for Swiss watches. There, the value of exports fell 23.2 per cent, year on year, between January and July, to SFr1,269.5mn. \u201cWe\u2019re being asked if [India] will be offsetting the maybe softer results in China,\u201d says Szegedi. \u201cNot yet, because it\u2019s an immature market\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We believe that now, as well, with the EFTA agreement, you have to enter it to test it and see how the market responds to your brands.\u201d\n\nGerald Charles started working with Ethos Watches, an Indian retailer, in Delhi and Mumbai last November after noticing rising demand from rich Indians who were travelling to, or had homes in, Dubai. It launched in two further locations, Bengaluru and Kochi, last month. Federico Ziviani, Gerald Charles chief executive, says there will be a fifth opening next year \u2014 bringing the brand, which he says makes 1,500 watches a year, to capacity for the country .\n\nHe says the Indian market, where the brand\u2019s emerald green watches are popular, is robust because it is driven by internal demand. \u201cThinking about what happened during Covid, where travelling was blocked, only the strong local markets performed well,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to be in India, rather than selling to Indian collectors from abroad, because this creates a service to them, because they have the watch right at [their] doorstep. [It also] creates robustness in case of any geopolitical or economic changes.\u201d\n\nZiviani says the challenge in a country of 1.4bn people is getting the watch \u201con the right wrist\u201d. \u201cWe have the advantage that the Gerald Charles watch\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is very polarising,\u201d he says. \u201cYou hate it or love it\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009so there is a strong component in the client choosing us.\u201d\n\nCricket \u2014 a sport beloved in India \u2014 is influential in growing brand awareness. Panerai previously had former India captain MS Dhoni as an ambassador and collaborated with him on two limited edition timepieces exclusive to the Indian market in 2019. Mohit Hemdev, Panerai brand manager for India, says this \u201creally helped the brand get the right kind of visibility in the market\u201d.\n\nJean-Marc Pontrou\u00e9, chief executive of Panerai, says exposure through cricket and the \u201cevolution\u201d of India meant the time was right for expansion. \u201cYou see the number of planes this country is ordering, the new facilities built, new industries growing \u2014 that is contributing to the development of the country, which creates a growing affluent customer group,\u201d he says. However, he says Panerai\u2019s growth will depend on \u201cthe speed of the luxury industry\u201d \u2014 such as the development of malls.\n\nPanerai opens its fourth India boutique, in Bengaluru, this month. The brand also has 10 points of sale across six cities with partners including TimeVall\u00e9e, the Richemont-owned multi-brand retailer. Pontrou\u00e9 says Panerai has tripled its business in India since 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s by far the fastest-growing nationality we see appearing more and more with knowledge of luxury watches,\u201d he says.\n\nPontrou\u00e9 says that, while India has a long association with jewellery, the more recent appetite for high-end watches is driven by interest in gold, jewellery watches, and Switzerland. Hundreds of Bollywood films have been at least partially shot in Switzerland, against scenic backdrops such as the Alps. \u201c[For] a lot of Indians, their first or second European destination to visit becomes Switzerland,\u201d says Hemdev.\n\nRado, which has worked with Indian Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan since 2011, took on British Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif as an ambassador last October to target female customers. Adrian Bosshard, Rado chief executive, says there has been an \u201coverproportion increase\u201d in its women\u2019s watch segment in India this year and last.\n\nOther brands are seeking to attract clients with special releases. Carl F Bucherer launched a Heritage BiCompax Annual Hometown limited edition dedicated to New Delhi, featuring city landmarks engraved on the case back, with Ethos Watches in June. Raymond Weil, which has traded in India since the early 1980s, launched the Freelancer Ganges India limited edition last October to celebrate 20 years of its own collaboration with Ethos.\n\nRado saw India overtake China as its largest market for sales about two years ago, says Bosshard. The brand has 33 boutiques in India and more than 200 other points of sale. Bosshard says Rado has built \u201ccustomer confidence\u201d, which helps as Indian consumers \u201care very cautious to have value for money\u201d. For this reason, the brand\u2019s ceramic watches are popular, he says, because their \u201cscratch resistance\u201d means they have \u201ca long-term beauty on your wrist\u201d.\n\nAn informal survey of about 100 partners and directors from Deloitte Consulting in India in July found that, while Rolex was the most recognised Swiss watch brand, it was followed by Swatch Group houses Omega, Tissot and Rado, respectively, showcasing the early investment that group made in the market. Popular high-end brands, including Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille, did not feature in this top 10 for brand recognition in India.\n\nBosshard compares the situation in India to what he saw in China 20 years ago. \u201cPurchasing power is growing and, of course, in this kind of environment people want to celebrate themselves.\u201d\n\nOne opportunity identified in the Deloitte Swiss Watch Industry spotlight on India, from July, is to tap into wedding gifting. It found 40 per cent of Indians planning to buy a watch within 12 months would do so for a present, compared with 27 per cent globally.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2023 study predicted India would be in the top 10 of Swiss watch export markets within a decade.

But there were more than 400,000 jobseekers for an estimated 5,000 positions, making the 30-year-old\u2019s chances about one in 80.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no hope, no chance\u201d of getting one of the government posts, Kumar said, which are prized because of the guaranteed hours, wages and benefits, however low, of public sector work. Among the applicants were two of his family members.\n\nKumar is one face of India\u2019s most intractable public policy issue: a chronic shortage of formal jobs in the world\u2019s most populous country and, according to companies, a corresponding shortage of suitable candidates to fill them.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s economic record will again be on the agenda in Haryana on Saturday in one in a series of regional polls in which the opposition will seek to build momentum against his Bharatiya Janata party. The opposition managed to push the BJP into a parliamentary minority for the first time since 2014 in nationwide elections this year, in part by highlighting persistently high joblessness.\n\nIndia\u2019s economy is failing to create enough jobs for its young and growing population and train the skilled workers its companies need to harness that demographic dividend. This mismatch is feeding widespread grievances and represents one of the biggest challenges for Modi as he enters his second decade in power.\n\n\u201cEvery month about a million formal job seekers are being added to the workforce,\u201d said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of Teamlease, which describes itself as India\u2019s biggest staffing company. \u201cNine out of 10 of them go into the informal sector \u2014 jobs where there is no employment contract, no social security benefits, no protection, and no wage guarantees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe poorest Indians tend to take on daily wage jobs in things like construction because there aren\u2019t too many alternatives,\u201d said Shruti Rajagopalan, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, in Virginia.\n\n\u201cThe people in the middle are still waiting, and would rather hold out for a government job, or work on the family farm because at least it provides them food security.\u201d\n\nModi\u2019s government has taken steps to tackle India\u2019s joblessness. In the first post-election budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an apprenticeship scheme aimed at benefiting 10mn young people over five years. The government has also promised training subsidies for companies, stipends for apprenticeships and help for vocational schools to amend their curricula to align with job market demands.\n\nIn its previous term, Modi\u2019s cabinet also cut corporate taxes and took steps to amend labour laws in a bid to stimulate job growth.\n\nCorporate India, however, laments a shortage of qualified candidates for its top jobs. Conglomerate Larsen & Toubro said in June that it faced a shortage of 45,000 skilled labourers and engineers across its businesses, which range from construction to information technology.\n\nAnalysts said the skills gap bodes ill for Modi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d manufacturing push, and attests to neglect and uneven standards at Indian secondary institutions.\n\n\u201cSo many people come out of these colleges, but we can do a lot to make them more employable in the industry,\u201d K Krithivasan, chief executive of Tata Consultancy Services, India\u2019s biggest IT company, told the Financial Times earlier this year.\n\nMohandas Pai, chair of private equity firm Aarin Capital and former chief financial officer at IT giant Infosys, said most industries were struggling to find skilled workers as India\u2019s economy expands at an annual clip of about 7 per cent, with job openings outpacing the supply of employable workers.\n\nAt the same time, he said: \u201cMany industries are not willing to spend money to hire them, skill them and train them.\u201d\n\nA study published this year by Quess Corp, an Indian business service provider, and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry argued that India faced a wage \u2014 rather than an employment \u2014 problem. About 80 per cent of jobs pay less than Rs20,000 ($238) a month, not enough to meet rising living expenses, the study\u2019s authors argued.\n\nOn the supply side, economists say cumbersome labour regulation is also holding back industry from creating jobs. Much of the legislation only kicks in for companies employing 10 people or more, points out George Mason University\u2019s Rajagopalan. \u201cEither people are not hiring the 10th worker, or they hire the worker informally,\u201d she said.\n\nModi\u2019s government in 2020 approved an overhaul of India\u2019s patchwork of labour laws, which regulate areas ranging from maximum shift hours to the number of clocks per factory floor. But the reforms have yet to take effect.\n\nThere is even disagreement over how to measure India\u2019s unemployment. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a think-tank, publishes the most widely cited indicator, which is conducted monthly. In August, it showed a jobless rate at 8.51 per cent, and unemployment on a rising trend.\n\n\u201cThis is a pretty high unemployment rate in a country growing at 7 to 8 per cent per annum,\u201d said Mahesh Vyas, CMIE\u2019s managing director. \u201cWe have also been seeing the unemployment rate very high for a long period now in both rural and urban regions.\u201d\n\nModi\u2019s political circle favours the Periodic Labour Force Survey, which reports quarterly rural and urban unemployment rates and shows the jobless rate at below 5 per cent and falling.\n\nAnalysts said the discrepancy was because of what counted as work, including part-time agricultural work.\n\nVyas claims the definition of a job in the PLFS is \u201ctoo relaxed\u201d. He also pointed to growth of India\u2019s net fixed assets at companies, which he said served as a proxy for employment and joblessness and had been growing at only about 5-6 per cent in recent years.\n\n\u201cEmployment will increase only if investments increase, and I don\u2019t see that,\u201d Vyas said.\n\nKumar, in Haryana, for example, might or might not qualify as unemployed depending on who is counting. He is earning some money on commission for a company that sells cattle feed, and is considering setting up a dairy business with his brother.\n\nLike many young Indians, he also aspired to an army post, completing a correspondence degree in political science and passing the written test three times. But he was rejected in the interview.\n\n\u201cYou need sources and contacts when you reach that level,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cI did not have them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have given up looking for jobs,\u201d he added.\n\n\u200bLetter in response to this article:\n\nIndia\u2019s rich are the main beneficiaries of growth\u00a0/\u00a0From Deepankar Basu, Associate Professor, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, US", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/14fc147e-8f11-45d7-9e7f-2ee97f899eea"}}, {"id": "aa34c0d2-410f-4fbb-ae8b-576f547a64dc", "event_name": "India tightens derivatives trading rules after retail options frenzy", "blurb": "Regulator aims to clamp down on country\u2019s retail trading mania", "date": "2024-10-0100:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s capital markets regulator has raised the barriers on derivatives trading to curb the frenzy among millions of young retail investors who have piled into high-risk options and short-term bets on the country\u2019s booming stock market.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India on Tuesday imposed tough measures including raising the minimum contract size on index derivatives by about three times to at least Rs1.5mn ($18,000). It also reduced the amount of tradable weekly options contracts to one per exchange from November.\n\nThe crackdown comes after the watchdog and India\u2019s finance ministry repeatedly issued warnings about the risks involved in derivatives markets. Investors can use options to leverage their bets, by borrowing many times the amount they have on deposit, but they can magnify losses as well as gains.\n\nThe Indian stock market has soared in recent years as the country has become the world\u2019s fastest growing large economy. While its expanding number of middle-class households are increasingly investing their savings in domestic equities, analysts have likened the fevered interest in derivatives trading to gambling in a nation where betting is not legal.\n\n\u201cThe equity cult has been going up in India,\u201d said Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities in Mumbai.\n\nThe problem is \u201cuninformed, uneducated investors are becoming prey to this retail speculative frenzy, that\u2019s where the regulator and the ministry of finance is concerned\u201d, he added.\n\nMany Indians have also been spurred on by a proliferation of cheap discount online brokerages and popular, if largely unregulated, \u201cfinfluencers\u201d who dish out trading tips on social media.\n\nIn a recent study, Sebi said fewer than one in 10 future and options traders made a profit. Its latest order noted the trend of \u201cincreased retail participation\u201d as well as \u201cheightened speculative trading columns in index derivatives on expiry day\u201d.\n\nResearch by Mumbai-based Axis Mutual Fund found that the number of active derivatives traders in India shot up to 4mn last year compared with fewer than 500,000 before the coronavirus pandemic. Most of them resided in the country\u2019s smaller cities and were below the age of 40.\n\nThe trend has drawn wider global attention after the notional value of options on India\u2019s benchmark Nifty 50 index overtook those on the S&P 500 and quant trading firm Jane Street reportedly made $1bn on trades in the country\u2019s option market last year.\n\nSebi\u2019s action is just the latest attempt to cool India\u2019s retail trading mania. While its latest order was published after local market hours, in July shares of listed Indian brokerages, which have cashed in on the derivatives boom, fell after new rules mandated uniform charges that are not discounted for high volumes.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s new curbs would \u201chave some impact\u201d, Bathini said.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/27e14b48-fcaa-459d-b036-a059af67b9a0"}}, {"id": "f7eae567-c1f9-49ef-b9dc-be2cd7139491", "event_name": "The key to India\u2019s economy? Making women safer ", "blurb": "Amid protests about pervasive violence, economists say women play far too small a role in the country\u2019s workforce", "date": "2024-09-3000:00:00.0", "body": "In the heart of the Indian megacity Kolkata, a makeshift protest camp has formed outside one of its most overburdened hospitals. The walls of RG Kar Medical College Hospital are covered with angry slogans: \u201cStop rape\u201d, \u201cWe want justice\u201d, \u201cStaying silent when the fire is raging is siding with the ones who lit it\u201d.\n\nThe demonstrations, which spread into a national strike, have come in response to the rape and murder of a female trainee doctor who was attacked at the hospital in early August. The 31-year-old lay down to sleep in a seminar room at the end of a 36-hour shift. The following morning, the woman \u2014 known publicly by the pseudonym Abhaya (\u201cfearless\u201d) because of an Indian law protecting the identities of victims \u2014 was found dead with appalling injuries, including signs of sexual assault.\n\nAccording to her colleagues, the state-run hospital lacks adequate facilities; doctors and patients of both genders are forced to share bathrooms, conditions described as both unsanitary and unsafe.\n\nThis is hardly the first instance of a brutal attack against a woman to cause shock and outrage across India. But the crime \u2014\u00a0and the protests \u2014 are resonating with unusual force. \u201cNowhere is safe for women,\u201d says Shyamadra Sarkar, 24, a medical student in Kolkata. Families feel it would be safer for daughters to be cooped up at home rather than risk going out to work, she says. \u201cParents think, \u2018If you\u2019re not safe outside, stay at home\u2019.\u201d\n\nAs well as highlighting the threat of violence, the case has also provoked much wider questions about the status of working women in the world\u2019s most populous nation and its biggest developing economy.\n\nAs part of his Viksit Bharat (\u201cDeveloped India\u201d) strategy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he wants India to have an economy worth $30tn by 2047, the centenary of its independence. But the nation currently employs only about a third of its women.\n\nThe prime minister has voiced frequent support for women-led development, including at last year\u2019s international events around the G20, which India chaired.\n\nSpeaking in August shortly after the murder, Gita Gopinath, deputy managing director of the IMF \u2014 one of India\u2019s most globally prominent professional women \u2014 described women\u2019s safety as \u201cnon-negotiable and crucial in getting more women employed\u201d, adding: \u201cThat cannot happen if women do not feel safe at work.\u201d\n\nMany economists have argued that encouraging more women to enter the paid workforce is one of the most important steps that India could undertake to turbocharge growth.\n\nThe World Bank has estimated that if women\u2019s participation in the workforce were to reach 50 per cent, India could boost its annual growth rate by 1.5 percentage points. Christine Lagarde, then IMF managing director, stated in 2015 that India\u2019s GDP would be nearly 30 per cent larger if the participation of women were to match that of men, describing this as an \u201ceconomic no-brainer\u201d.\n\nMany of Asia\u2019s successful manufacturing economies have benefited from creating safe, welcoming workplaces for women. Female workers notably played a key role in building the economy of China, India\u2019s biggest neighbour and rival. In Vietnam, nearly 70 per cent of women are in paid work, far above the global average.\n\nAdding to the pressure for change is India\u2019s aspiration to draw in foreign direct investment from companies exiting China. Multibillion-dollar government subsidies for export industries, part of the country\u2019s bid to become a \u201cChina plus-one\u201d manufacturing power, have targeted electronics \u2014 a sector where producers like Samsung and Apple tend to prize female workers\u2019 focus and dexterity over men\u2019s.\n\n\u201cGender is now macro-critical in India,\u201d says Radhicka Kapoor, a senior specialist on employment with the International Labour Organization in New Delhi. \u201cWhen you have all these targets of becoming a developed economy by 2047, you need additional drivers of growth \u2014 and addressing the gender gap is an important part of that.\u201d\n\nIndian politicians agree there is a clear link between women\u2019s safety \u2014 their ability to get to and from jobs unharmed, and work without fear once they are there \u2014 and their underrepresentation in the workforce. Families and lawmakers routinely cite safety concerns as a reason to keep women out of the labour force, or restrict where and when they can work.\n\n\u201cConversations around the safety of women can switch into very high gear,\u201d says Rukmini S, an independent data journalist and author of the book Whole Numbers and Half Truths. \u201cThis has an impact on perceptions and the willingness to send women out to work.\u201d\n\nAccording to India\u2019s national crime record bureau, the recorded rate of all crimes against women rose about 13 per cent over the four years to 2022, though analysts say it is hard to assess whether this is attributable to better reporting and more women speaking out, or a genuine increase in incidents.\n\nThe Georgetown Institute\u2019s 2023 Women Peace and Security Index ranked India 128th out of 177 countries globally, and highlights areas for improvement in women\u2019s empowerment, justice and safety. The ranking noted a marked drop in women\u2019s perception of their own safety since 2017, when the survey began.\n\nA report by the economic think-tank Prosperiti recently highlighted persistent workplace discrimination against women, noting that more than 50 laws limit employment in industries deemed hazardous, as varied as in the petroleum industry and liquor sales. Twenty-four of India\u2019s 36 states and territories restrict women\u2019s right to work on night shifts, while 11 states prohibit women entirely from working at night \u2014\u00a0measures designed to protect women, but which have the effect of limiting their participation in the workforce even further.\n\nCampaigners have called for reforms to address gender stereotypes in legislation and encourage solutions like CCTV and safer transport. But change has been slow. Since 2022, a few states, including Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, have eased their restrictions on night shifts \u2014 partly because of pressure from manufacturers such as Apple and its supplier Foxconn, which are expanding their operations there.\n\nWomen do, of course, contribute enormous amounts to the Indian economy, but largely via unpaid work at home, in family businesses or in agriculture. Because of entrenched patriarchal and cultural norms, Indian women are heavily burdened by caregiving responsibilities, analysts say, limiting workforce supply. A recent government report estimated that childcare and home commitments kept 44.5 per cent of women out of work.\n\nAs so often, it is a vicious cycle. \u201cEmployers discriminate against women as they are perceived as less attached to their jobs than men,\u201d says the ILO\u2019s Kapoor. And in a country where good jobs are scarce, opportunities are more limited still.\n\nComparative data shows that India lags most of its south Asian neighbours when it comes to women in paid work \u2014 even poorer countries like Bangladesh, where women dominate one of the continent\u2019s biggest garment industries. And such discrimination spans class divides, with some wealthier families keeping women at home because they can afford to.\n\n\u201cIn India, more prosperous families prefer that the daughter-in-law doesn\u2019t work outside the house,\u201d says Swati Narayan, author of Unequal, a book about how India compares to its neighbours in areas such as health, education and work.\n\nDespite being in a weakened position after an election in which his party lost its majority, Modi is pushing forward with his Viksit Bharat programme.\n\n\u201cIt would be harder for India to become a Viksit Bharat by 2047 if one-third of the population is not engaging \u2014 most likely not out of choice but because there are limited opportunities,\u201d argues Poonam Gupta, director of the National Council of Applied Economic Research.\n\nThe government has put in place policies and benefits designed to support women, including a Rs100 ($1) cut in the price of cooking gas \u2014 announced on March 8, International Women\u2019s Day. According to a statement put out by the prime minister, this was a way of \u201cempowering women and ensuring \u2018ease of living\u2019 for them\u201d.\n\nEconomists point out, however, that such policies incentivise women to stay at home, and that it might be more valuable for the state to create employment in areas where women are under-represented, including law enforcement; according to a 2022 study, women made up just over 10 per cent of India\u2019s police force.\n\nModi\u2019s own council of ministers features only seven women \u2014 fewer than 10 per cent of the total. Despite changes to legislation aimed at making boardrooms more inclusive, women hold just 18 per cent of board seats in India, compared with a global average of more than 23 per cent.\n\n\u201cFor women-led development, we need more women leaders,\u201d says Gupta. \u201cBuilding the pipeline for women\u2019s leadership requires both intention and concerted measures.\u201d\n\nA working paper on \u201cunshackling job creators\u201d, prepared under the auspices of Viksit Bharat by a government think-tank and published in June, envisions a future in which women make up more than half of India\u2019s high-skilled labour force, and makes recommendations on reducing \u201cstructural barriers\u201d to women\u2019s work, including childcare responsibilities and restrictive social norms.\n\nGupta, the NCAER economist, calls for measures that would allow women to move around and travel without fear \u2014 a key to the huge expansion of manufacturing in Vietnam, for example. \u201cWe have to make every space in the country safe for women,\u201d she says.\n\nSome have tried to find tech-based solutions. As long as a decade ago, in the wake of a Delhi gang rape that caused national outrage, tech giant Microsoft launched Guardian, an Indian-specific women\u2019s safety app that allows users to share their location with contacts in real time.\n\nIndia\u2019s southern states have taken the lead on this issue. On average, the south of India is more developed than the north and devotes more resources to female education, health and mobility. Data from the 2021-22 Annual Survey of Industries showed that more than two-thirds of all Indian women working in industry were in four southern states: Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. Tamil Nadu alone accounts for nearly half of India\u2019s female workers.\n\n\u201cLabour force participation is higher in southern states \u2014 that is a fact,\u201d says the data journalist Rukmini S.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, these are also the states keenest to attract foreign direct investment, and which are leading the way by promoting solutions for female workers such as safe bus transport and workers\u2019 hostels.\n\nSome Indian companies, including the diversified Tata Group and the consumer goods group Hindustan Unilever, are taking steps to increase female employment.\n\nKapoor, the ILO economist, says that India might start to tackle the problems around supply and demand by creating jobs in the care sector, which would enable new paid jobs \u2014 ones less likely to be endangered by artificial intelligence and automation \u2014\u00a0and free up more women to work.\n\n\u201cThis is something Indian women were traditionally comfortable working in, and it creates decent employment,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also represents an investment in human capital and the productivity of future generations.\u201d\n\nIn Kolkata, meanwhile, both female and male trainee doctors at RG Kar are still on strike, defying orders to return to work except in emergencies. \u201cOur parents say they must sit with us in the hospital, especially on night shifts, because authorities aren\u2019t doing enough,\u201d says Shreya Shaw, a spokesperson.\n\nNearly two months later and despite five arrests, Abhaya\u2019s case remains unsolved and still under investigation, which has intensified pressure on the authorities.\n\nAddressing the nation on independence day a few days after the murder, Modi condemned \u201catrocities\u201d against women. Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal state, where the crime occurred, and India\u2019s most powerful female politician, said the accused should be hanged. Yet even she has been attacked by figures in Modi\u2019s rival Bharatiya Janata party and others, who accused her of responding too slowly.\n\nThe protesters are not budging from their demands. The first of these is justice: they want the culprits who murdered Abhaya punished. Initial rumours suggested a case of suicide, and there was an unusual delay in filing a police report on the case, says Shaw. \u201cWe had the suspicion that something was not right.\u201d\n\nThe protesters are also demanding that Kolkata\u2019s commissioner of police resign, along with those responsible at the medical college (the former principal has been arrested on charges of evidence-tampering). As well as enhanced safety measures on the campus, including CCTV cameras and more security personnel, they also want more places where women can rest during and after shifts. \u201cThere are restrooms, but they are not sufficient and not adequate for women,\u201d Shaw says.\n\nShayamadra, the medical student, says that, even if even the numbers of women in paid work have increased in India, for far too long life \u201chas been hard\u201d for anyone wanting a career.\n\n\u201cEven though the numbers are going up, the changes are happening at a very superficial level,\u201d she says. \u201cI am hoping society will truly change in the future.\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Aditi Bhandari", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/eb034596-406d-439f-8c3d-c884d7a9e633"}}, {"id": "9efe5b14-c5b7-4088-8bf4-b03600a0446b", "event_name": "BofA suspends bankers following probe into Asian stock offerings", "blurb": "An internal investigation is examining whether executives tipped off certain investors of upcoming secondary offerings", "date": "2024-09-2700:00:00.0", "body": "Bank of America has placed two bankers in India on administrative leave as part of an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing in the US financial giant\u2019s Asian investment bank, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe internal investigation, which was launched earlier this year following a whistleblower complaint, is probing whether BofA and bankers in its Asian operations had tipped off certain investors of upcoming secondary offerings, allowing those investors to \u201cfront run\u201d the stock sales and profit from nonpublic information.\n\nA spokesperson for BofA declined to comment.

In November last year, the RBI said lenders had to increase the risk weight, the minimum amount of capital they must hold in relation to the asset, for personal loans from 100 per cent to 125 per cent.\n\n\u201cRBI is worried about the rising cases of delinquencies at the unsecured borrower level and they want to pre-empt it,\u201d said Abhay Agarwal, founder and fund manager at Indian asset manager Piper Serica in Mumbai, which exited its holdings in the country\u2019s lenders in July.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want the bubble to become so big that when it blows, it hurts the entire financial lending system.\u201d\n\nThe RBI\u2019s moves have helped ease growth in credit card and unsecured personal loans, with the overall pace of retail lending by banks moderating to 14 per cent in July from 31 per cent a year earlier, according to the central bank\u2019s most recent data.\n\nBut Nomura analysts estimate that personal loan delinquencies in India overdue by more than 90 days have increased to 5.1 per cent in the last financial year from 3.9 per cent.\n\nRajeev Jain, chief executive of Bajaj Finance, the country\u2019s largest non-bank lender, told the FT it had been pruning back its own exposure to unsecured lending after it became \u201chot\u201d.\n\n\u201cSupply in a business like credit always finds demand\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009when so many people jump in it leads to some level of exuberance,\u201d Jain said. \u201cWe are watching it carefully to see whether there could be more problems down the road.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s shadow banks are expected to be hit by a rise in delinquencies of between 30 to 50 basis points in the year through to March 2025, resulting in increased credit costs, according to ICRA, an Indian rating agency owned by Moody\u2019s Ratings.\n\n\u201cThey had a great time post-Covid,\u201d said Agarwal, referring to the lending sector. \u201cBut that party is now over.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0665c6d4-9a24-4a5c-8bb5-82b57c1bb9c4"}}, {"id": "69c41bb6-bdae-4eeb-b75b-c7b7537175d2", "event_name": "Chess: India win Olympiad gold as new generation dominates in Budapest", "blurb": "Puzzle: find the win that the world No 3 missed", "date": "2024-09-2300:00:00.0", "body": "A new generation is taking over at the top of world chess.

The US took\u00a0team\u00a0silver, and the unanswered question remained whether they would have outscored India if the world No2 Hikaru Nakamura had travelled to Budapest instead of opting to prefer his streaming\u00a0career.\n\nEngland finished 20th on 15/22.

Erigaisi\u2019s mature strategic style is ambitious with both colours. In round five at Budapest he instructively defused the dangerous Dragon Sicilian and reached a winning rook endgame.\n\nChina, which won gold on its last appearance, was handicapped by the continuing\u00a0poor form\u00a0of the reigning world champion Ding Liren, who has\u00a0now dropped out of the world top 20 in the live ratings.\n\nThe chess elite will come to London next month when the\u00a0franchise-based six-team Tech Mahindra Global League is played at Friends House, Euston, from October 3 to 12.\u00a0World champions Carlsen and Anand,\u00a0world No 2 Nakamura, and the double world title challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi will all lead teams.

That implies roughly 131 tonnes of bullion imports, the sixth-highest total on record by volume, according to a preliminary estimate from consultancy Metals Focus.\n\nThe high gold price \u2014 which is up by one-quarter since the start of the year \u2014 has traditionally deterred price-sensitive Asian buyers, with Indians reducing demand for gold jewellery in response.\n\nBut the Indian government cut import duties on gold by 9 percentage points at the end of July, triggering a renewed surge in demand in the world\u2019s second-largest buyer of gold.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the duty cut was unprecedented, it was incredible,\u201d said Philip Newman, managing director of Metals Focus in London. \u201cIt really brought consumers in.\u201d\n\nThe tariff cut has been a boon for Indian jewellery stores such as MK Jewels in the upmarket Mumbai suburb of Bandra West, where director Ram Raimalani said \u201cdemand has been fantastic\u201d.\n\nCustomers were packed into the store browsing for necklaces and bangles on a recent afternoon, and Raimalani is expecting an annual sales boost of as much as 40 per cent during the multi-month festival and wedding season that runs from September to February.\n\nRaimalani praised India\u2019s government and \u201cModi ji\u201d, an honorific for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for reducing gold duties.\n\nExpectations of rapid interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve have been the main driver of gold\u2019s huge rally this year, according to analysts. Lower borrowing costs increase the attraction of assets with no yield, such as bullion, and are also likely to weigh on the dollar, in which gold is denominated.\n\nThe Fed cut rates by half a per cent on Wednesday, pushing gold to yet another record high, just below $2,600.\n\nBut strong demand for gold jewellery and bars, as well as buying by central banks, have also helped buoy prices.\n\nIndia accounted for about a third of gold jewellery demand last year, and has become the world\u2019s second-largest bar and coin market, according to data from the World Gold Council, an industry body.\n\nHowever, that demand has meant that domestic gold prices in India are quickly catching up to the level they were at before the tariff duty cut, according to Harshal Barot, senior research consultant at Metals Focus.\n\n\u201cThat entire benefit [of the tariff cut] has kind of vanished,\u201d said Barot. \u201cNow that prices are going up again, we will have to see if consumers still buy as usual.\u201d\n\nJewellery buying had been flagging before the cut in import duty, with demand in India in the first half of 2024 at its lowest level since 2020, according to the World Gold Council.\n\nIndia\u2019s central bank has also been on a gold buying spree, adding 42 tonnes of gold to its reserves during the first seven months of the year \u2014 more than double its purchases for the whole of 2023.\n\nA person familiar with the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s thinking called the gold purchases a \u201croutine\u201d part of its foreign exchange reserve and currency stability management.\n\nIn China, the world\u2019s biggest physical buyer of gold, high prices have meant fewer jewellery sales, but more sales of gold bars and coins, which surged 62 per cent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier.\n\n\u201cWe observed strong positive correlation between gold investment demand and the gold price,\u201d wrote the World Gold Council, referring to China.\n\nAll of this has helped support the physical market and mitigate the impact that high prices can have in eroding demand.\n\n\u201cIt acts as a stable foundation for demand,\u201d said Paul Wong, a market strategist at Sprott Asset Management. \u201cIn parts of Asia, gold is readily convertible into currency,\u201d making it popular for savings, he said.\n\nWestern investor demand has also been a big factor in bullion\u2019s rally, with a net $7.6bn flowing into gold-backed exchange traded funds over the past four months.\n\nAfter hitting a fresh high on Wednesday, analysts warn there could be a correction in the gold price.\n\n\u201cWhen you have this scale of anticipation [of rate cuts], for this long, there is room for disappointment,\u201d said Adrian Ash, London-based director of research at BullionVault, an online gold marketplace. \u201cI think there is scope for a pullback in precious alongside other assets.\u201d\n\nWhether or not gold pulls back from its record highs, Indian jewellery demand looks set to remain strong through the coming wedding season, according to MK Jewels\u2019 Raimalani.\n\nSoaring prices of bullion have been no deterrent to his customers, he added. \u201cIndians are the happiest when prices go high because they already own so much gold.

Narendra Modi\u2019s government has since confirmed she is in India, but is declining to say more. That has not stopped tongues from wagging.\n\nWith various degrees of credibility, members of India\u2019s chattering classes have privately claimed that the deposed strongwoman is in an Indian government safe house; staying with her daughter Saima Wazed, who took a Delhi-based regional job with the World Health Organisation in February; or has even been glimpsed strolling with her entourage around one of the capital\u2019s poshest parks, Lodhi Garden.\n\nThe Modi government, Hasina\u2019s top foreign backer when her Awami League party ran Bangladesh, is maintaining a decorous silence on the topic. Delhi\u2019s local and foreign press have mostly stopped pretending they will get Hasina\u2019s first post-overthrow interview.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this.\u00a0Muhammad Yunus\u2019s acting government, which took power after Hasina was toppled, has accused her of responsibility for hundreds of killings during the past summer\u2019s unrest. India and Bangladesh have an extradition treaty \u2014 signed by Hasina\u2019s own government in 2013 \u2014 which could in theory be used against her should the new regime seek her arrest.\n\n\u201cAccording to the extradition agreement with India, we may demand her extradition to Bangladesh,\u201d Asif Nazrul, minister of law, justice and parliamentary affairs in Yunus\u2019s interim cabinet, tells the Financial Times. \u201cFor now, we expect India not to allow her to instigate instability in Bangladesh, which she is trying to do by spreading lies and misinformation.\u201d\n\nFollowing recent press reports relaying controversial remarks attributed to Hasina, Yunus himself said (in words that in turn ruffled some in the Indian establishment): \u201cIf India wants to keep her until the time Bangladesh wants her back, the condition would be that she has to keep quiet.\u201d\n\nIndia has a history of offering refuge to fleeing regional leaders. The Dalai Lama settled in India after fleeing the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1959. Though he has handed over political affairs to a civilian exile administration (also based in India), the Tibetan spiritual leader recently received a US Congressional delegation, a move that riled Beijing and which analysts say would not have taken place without the Modi government\u2019s assent.\n\nAfghan leader Mohammad Najibullah\u2019s family fled to India in 1992, where his wife Fatana Najib and children still reportedly spend much of their time. (They keep a low profile; Najibullah himself was kept from fleeing and, after years sheltering in a UN compound, was killed and strung from a traffic light pole by the Taliban as they swept into Kabul\u00a0in 1996).\n\nHasina herself, along with her sister Sheikh Rehana, took refuge in India for several years after 1975, when their father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of their family were murdered in Dhaka in a coup. \u201cThere has been a host of precedents of leaders coming to India from the neighbourhood,\u201d says Shivshankar Menon, a former foreign secretary and national security adviser under Manmohan Singh\u2019s government. \u201cWe have always allowed them to stay, and in most cases they respect our wishes that they stay clear of political activity.\u201d\n\nHasina is widely supported across the Indian political spectrum, where she is seen as a bulwark against Islamist extremism, and remembered with respect for her late father\u2019s pivotal role in Bangladesh\u2019s 1971 war of independence, in which Indira Gandhi\u2019s government supported the winning side, at huge human cost.\n\nThe theory that Hasina\u2019s ousting and Yunus\u2019s installation as acting prime minister was a \u201ccolour revolution\u201d or a regime change backed by the US, which supported Pakistan in 1971, has broad currency in India, and not just in pro-Modi circles.\n\nThe sensitivities of Hasina\u2019s sojourn in India, say analysts, also mean a cloak of discretion is likely to surround her whereabouts for now \u2014 and by New Delhi\u2019s design.\n\n\u201cThese are the problems of intimacy, and things are delicate when it comes to our neighbours,\u201d says Menon. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re dealing with countries on the other side of the world.\u201d\n\njohn.reed@ft.com", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/06d1339f-6b8e-414a-bdde-38eb426dc293"}}, {"id": "d4fbea93-681d-4814-917d-dc65ebc4a16c", "event_name": "Chess: India well placed for first Olympiad gold as US falters", "blurb": "Puzzle: find White\u2019s endgame win", "date": "2024-09-1700:00:00.0", "body": "India is the rising nation of world chess.

Click on to Open or Women and you can watch any game you choose, with an evaluation bar to show who has the advantage.\n\nThe Fide congress, which takes place during the Olympiad, will include a controversial motion to restore full voting rights to Russia and Belarus, who were banned in 2022 when the Olympiad was switched at short notice\u00a0from Moscow to Chennai.\u00a0The motion is believed to have enough votes for a majority, despite strong\u00a0opposition from Ukraine and its allies. Meanwhile, Fide has scored a marketing success.\u00a0Google will be the title sponsor of the Ding v\u00a0Gukesh $2.6mn world title match in Singapore, the first such by a major international\u00a0company since Intel in the 1990s.\n\nThe Olympiad traditionally accepts entries from the smallest and weakest nations in the interests of a huge entry of nearly 190 teams, and this policy is guaranteed to continue at its next two renewals at Tashkent 2026 and Abu Dhabi 2028.\n\nThe resulting organisational strains would arguably diminish if the Olympiad had a qualifying standard, as does the Olympic Games.\u00a0A minimum level per team of around 2000 rating points, expert level, for the Open event and 1800 for the Women\u2019s Olympiad would make the numbers more manageable. Half a century ago,\u00a0when the legendary Soviet, American and Yugoslav teams ruled the event, there were few weak entrants.\u00a0As it is now, there are games on the lowest Olympiad boards which would shame a novice.\n\nPuzzle 2590\n\nVasyl Ivanchuk v Wesley So, Ukraine v United States, Budapest Olympiad 2024.

In August it secured a $45bn valuation and drew in investment from Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, the FT reported last week.\n\nThe fintech is also seeking to expand in the Middle East and has applied for e-money and remittance licences with the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, according to a person familiar with the application.\n\nFintechs have proliferated in India, catering to millions of its growing middle class who previously had limited access to formal banking services.\n\nThat has been encouraged by New Delhi, which supported the development of the India stack, a government-backed interoperable digital infrastructure that means companies can build integrated apps providing access to services from welfare payments to loans.\n\nHowever, the challenge for most Indian fintechs is \u201cunit economics\u201d, Chatterjee said, given India\u2019s low GDP per capita, estimated by the IMF at $2,730. The realistic size of the market for Revolut was \u201cpretty much\u201d the top 10-15 per cent of India\u2019s 1.4bn population, \u201cwhich is sizeable\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the segment that also consumes Netflix, that consumes your Apple products\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that travels and travels internationally as well, what I term the global India,\u201d Chatterjee said. \u201cThey have friends and family overseas, they\u2019ve probably studied overseas, worked overseas and come back or vice versa.\u201d\n\nChatterjee\u2019s focus since joining Revolut three years ago had been to secure regulatory approvals and spearhead efforts to make its platform compliant with the country\u2019s \u201cfairly stringent data localisation norms\u201d, she said.\n\nRevolut will now submit an audit report to the Reserve Bank of India next month with the aim of getting full authorisation after the tentative approval.

The mortgage provider registered a 31 per cent annual increase of assets under management to Rs970bn ($12bn) in the quarter through to the end of June.\n\nThe listing comes after India\u2019s central bank ordered a group of large non-bank lenders to go public by 2025 in an effort to enhance regulation of the sector.\n\nSanjiv Bajaj, chair of Bajaj Finserv, the family\u2019s financial services holding company, told the Financial Times that regardless of the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s rules it was a good time to list the company and diversify its funding.\n\nIndian companies are enjoying heightened valuations in the country\u2019s equity market, which is being driven to record highs by a rush of retail investors.\n\nBajaj said it was also an \u201copen question\u201d whether Bajaj Finance, which has $42bn in assets under management, would float its four-year-old brokerage business down the line.\n\nThe billionaire also sought to downplay concerns over a rise in bad loans, adding that a deterioration of personal loan credit quality following a boom in retail lending during the pandemic was temporary.\n\n\u201cIt will come back within a manageable level and then it\u2019ll grow from there again,\u201d Bajaj said in an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in the western Indian city of Pune. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen multiple such cycles over the last couple of decades.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, the RBI has warned over the breakneck growth of consumer loans and credit card debt, raising capital requirements late last year. Risk taking by the country\u2019s non-bank lenders, which have fuelled India\u2019s economic growth, sparked a credit crisis six years ago, leading to the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services.\n\nWhile the central bank\u2019s moves have cooled growth in unsecured lending, personal loan delinquencies climbed to 5.1 per cent in the last financial year from 3.9 per cent, according to Nomura estimates.\n\nBajaj Finance, the conglomerate\u2019s $55bn market cap lending arm, has increased its customer base 21 per cent over the past year to 88mn customers.\n\nBut in the latest quarter ending in June it reported loan losses and provisions set aside to cover potential defaults were up 69 per cent annually to Rs16.85bn. Profit after tax rose 14 per cent on an annual basis in the quarter through June to Rs39bn.\n\nThe lender has been pruning back risky loans, including to retail customers in India\u2019s vast rural hinterland whose economy has struggled to recover following the pandemic, and expects loan losses to come down by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe saw slightly elevated stress levels in unsecured personal loans and we slowed down our growth over there,\u201d Bajaj said. \u201cThe important thing is to take note of it, act on it and then go back to it when the times get better.\u201d\n\nBajaj added that he was untroubled by heightened competition, including from other shadow lenders, such as Jio Financial Services, which was listed last year and is owned by rival Indian billionaire and Asia\u2019s wealthiest tycoon Mukesh Ambani.\n\n\u201cWe are still only 2 per cent of India\u2019s credit and as a credit market we are expected to grow at 13 per cent to 15 per cent for the next many years,\u201d Bajaj said. \u201cWe are not in saturated markets like the west.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6ae2d766-3a66-4726-9f85-9b1dc96b55a1"}}, {"id": "d8541204-68c0-4f36-81fd-51ce16e1860c", "event_name": "Ford to restart India car production 3 years after quitting", "blurb": "US automaker plans to use mothballed Tamil Nadu plant to build vehicles for export", "date": "2024-09-1300:00:00.0", "body": "Ford plans to reboot a mothballed manufacturing plant in India three years after the US automaker said it would stop building cars in the world\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nThe decision by Ford comes as India\u2019s government seeks to attract billions of dollars of investment from international car manufacturers as they diversity supply chains way from China, a geopolitical rival that has dominated sales of electric vehicles.\n\nFord said on Friday that it had submitted a letter to the government of Tamil Nadu, a business-friendly southern Indian state known as the country\u2019s Detroit, to repurpose its existing factory in the city of Chennai for exports.\n\nFord had operated in India for almost three decades before announcing it would shut down production in the country in 2021 after struggling to crack its massive domestic market.\n\nKay Hart, president at Ford\u2019s international markets group, said the carmaker had \u201cexplored different options for the Chennai plant\u201d and its reopening was aimed \u201cto underscore our ongoing commitment to India as we intend to leverage the manufacturing expertise available in Tamil Nadu to serve new global markets\u201d.\n\nThe announcement came just days after Ford\u2019s senior leadership met in the US with Tamil Nadu\u2019s chief minister MK Stalin.

By then, Indian tourists will account for $89bn of the market value, it forecasts, more than double the $38bn recorded in 2019.\n\nThe Middle East is Indians\u2019 top destination for outbound travel, accounting for nearly half of foreign trips, followed by south-east Asia, North America and western Europe, Bernstein said.\n\nIndia is now the biggest source of holidaymakers in Dubai, ahead of neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Oman. It is the third-largest source of tourists for Thailand, according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand, which has organised roadshows in Indian cities such as Ahmedabad, Chandigarh and Lucknow in an effort to secure more visitors.\n\nWith India\u2019s market growing and China struggling to revive outbound tourism after the pandemic, \u201cIndia is taking the share of what was left by the Chinese pre-Covid,\u201d said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that India\u2019s travel market will be among the largest in the world over time,\u201d said Elie Maalouf, chief executive of Holiday Inn and InterContinental owner IHG.\n\nA record 115,000-plus departures are scheduled from Indian airports in September, a 9 per cent increase from a year ago, according to aviation data provider Cirium.\u00a0Airlines, including India\u2019s two biggest carriers, are planning for a tourism take-off. IndiGo Airlines and Air India ordered 500 and 470 new aircraft, respectively, last year, the two biggest orders in aviation history.\n\nAir Canada will add 40 per cent more seat capacity for the Indian market from October. \u201cThe Indian outbound market is about large families travelling,\u201d said Charles. \u201cAirlines and hotels benefit from more seats and rooms being bought by a family rather than just two people travelling together.\u201d\n\nThe impact of greater disposable income and willingness to travel will also be felt domestically. By 2027, India will be the third-biggest domestic tourism market after the US and China, Bernstein estimates \u2014 though still trailing those markets by a large margin.\n\nWith 65 hotels, India\u2019s domestic market now accounts for 2 per cent of the global transaction volume of Accor, the hotel group behind Novotel and Sofitel.

He followed in Modi\u2019s footsteps by meeting US politicians and diaspora Indians \u2014 but with the swagger of a man who suddenly believes he has a good shot at replacing him.\n\nHis trip is the first to the US since an election when Modi\u2019s political opponents pushed the prime minister\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party into a minority, forcing it to rely on smaller partners and putting the strongman on the defensive. Gandhi, formerly the opposition\u2019s most prominent face, is now its official leader.\n\nGandhi\u2019s style was more low-key and business-like than Modi\u2019s, who moves through India and the world in a whirl of pomp and ceremony. But analysts say this was part of a calculated push by Gandhi\u2019s Indian National Congress to present its candidate as a credible future leader with his finger on the pulse of ordinary Indians and an alternative vision for the country.\n\n\u201cRahul Gandhi has gone to the US at a time when he is increasingly becoming a symbol of all those unhappy with Narendra Modi and his government,\u201d said Neerja Chowdhury, author of a book about Indian prime ministers who has been covering politics since the days of Rahul\u2019s grandmother Indira.\n\nThe trip comes just ahead of Modi\u2019s visit to the US later this month.

The events showcased the 73-year-old leader\u2019s popularity among overseas Indians, and boosted his brand back home.\n\n\u201cWhenever Modi went abroad, he has done meetings with the diaspora and made it part of his diplomatic toolkit,\u201d said C Raja Mohan, professor at the National University of Singapore. \u201cAs the BJP showed that it was gaining ground in diaspora communities, the Congress party has finally gotten into that.\u201d\n\nGandhi\u2019s events have not matched Modi\u2019s in scale or spectacle. But that is the point, party officials say. In talks with Indian diaspora groups, university students and faculty \u2014 and a press conference of the type Modi eschews \u2014 Gandhi has invoked the selfless ideals of his namesake Mahatma Gandhi. He even spoke of \u201clove in politics\u201d, a theme of his two treks across India.\n\n\u201cThe difference between what Modi does and what we do is that we are more into interactions, conversations \u2014 and not a big rally of 10,000 people where they just broadcast their messages and everyone claps,\u201d said Sam Pitroda, chair of the Indian Overseas Congress, a diaspora organisation affiliated with the party. \u201cWe want to learn, and we are not here for an election rally.\u201d\n\nParty officials insist Gandhi\u2019s visit was \u201cnot political\u201d, and he did not visit in his official capacity as opposition leader, dispensing with the protocols that would require.\n\nBut he did meet US lawmakers on Tuesday, as well as the state department official Donald Lu \u2014 signs that Washington is keeping tabs on India\u2019s shifting political tides at a time when the two countries are bolstering ties.\n\nSome of Gandhi\u2019s words and actions drew angry comment from Modi\u2019s supporters and other critics back in New Delhi, who see him as a political lightweight, unfit to run India, who owes his position to his family name.\n\nIn Dallas, Gandhi made remarks musing about the meaning of the Hindi word devta (\u201cdeity\u201d), which Modi supporters jumped on, and the right-wing pro-government Republic TV channel deemed \u201cabsurd\u201d. In Washington he met Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar, who visited the Pakistani-controlled part of the disputed region of Kashmir in 2022, and whom one BJP official described as a \u201cPakistan-sponsored anti-India voice\u201d.\n\nThe blowback in India was a reminder of controversies that arose around Gandhi\u2019s past foreign trips, and what analysts describe as his continuing frailties as a politician.\n\nBut since the election, as the political commentator Chowdhury puts it, \u201cpeople have been looking at him with new eyes\u201d.

Online disrupters hastily shuttling small volume orders also caught favour among families with low disposable incomes and limited storage in cramped homes.\n\nThe intensive cash-burning operations have overcome initial industry scepticism after establishing deep networks of dark stores that house a wide-range of goods \u2014 from fizzy drinks to fresh vegetables \u2014 in a compact delivery radius.\n\nWhile remaining a sliver of India\u2019s overall retail market, the country\u2019s digital quick commerce sector has witnessed a more than 10-fold annual expansion over the past couple of years to become a $3bn market in 2023, according to JM Financial.\n\nThe Indian investment bank estimated earlier this year that the industry size could reach $40bn by the end of the decade, as millions of urbanite Indians become addicted \u201cto a hypnotic dose of value and convenience\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe rise of quick commerce has taken a whole lot of people, including me, by big surprise,\u201d says Arvind Singhal, chair of India retail-focused consultancy Technopak Advisors. \u201cNow to me anything more than 20 minutes looks very slow \u2014 it\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nBut more recently it has become difficult for me to get deliveries with Dunzo and several of my orders have been cancelled. It appears to have come under financial pressure despite deep-pocketed investors including Google and Reliance Retail, an arm of Mukesh Ambani\u2019s conglomerate.\n\nIndian media have reported that the start-up laid off 75 per cent of its core staff last month, with just 50 remaining, and that any further capital raise would probably sharply reduce the $744mn valuation it received last year.\n\nWhile Dunzo\u2019s founder Kabeer Biswas did not respond to a request for comment, analysts say the app failed to convince users to shift to its in-house Dunzo Daily service, its dark network of stores.\n\nMany customers were probably put off as its delivery fees climbed in a country where every rupee is counted by thrifty households, Singhal says. Akshay D\u2019Souza, a consumer consultant, adds: \u201cThey got driven towards a more profitable model a little too soon.\u201d\n\nDunzo\u2019s demise is one part of a wider industry consolidation.\n\nMany of India\u2019s once 10 active players have folded and quick commerce is now dominated by a trio of trendsetting apps \u2014 Blinkit, owned by listed takeaway company Zomato; SoftBank-backed Swiggy and Zepto.

The Kenyan aviation workers\u2019 union also opposed the plans, arguing they would lead to local job cuts and the employment of foreigners.\n\nThe Kenya Airports Authority said Adani\u2019s proposal to refurbish the facility and invest in a new terminal and runway was needed to spruce up the \u201cageing infrastructure\u201d at the largest airport in east Africa\u2019s most advanced economy.\n\nAdani has renewed its international expansion efforts, including a port deal in Tanzania this year, after damaging fraud allegations levelled at the company by US short seller Hindenburg Research, which the group has repeatedly denied.\n\nThe tycoon\u2019s conglomerate has developed its businesses in tandem with infrastructure goals set by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Among the most contentious was the deal with Adani, owned by Asia\u2019s second-richest man Gautam Adani, to supply coal power from its 1,600-megawatt Godda plant in India.\n\nAdani Power told the Financial Times: \u201cWe are in constant dialogue with the Bangladesh government and have appraised them of this unsustainable situation where we are meeting not just our supply commitment but also [commitments] to our lenders and suppliers in spite of rising receivables.\u201d\n\nThe conglomerate said it would \u201ccontinue to supply reliable and competitively priced power from our Godda facility to Bangladesh, despite mounting dues\u201d.\n\nMuhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, Yunus\u2019s top energy adviser, told the FT that Bangladesh \u2014 which faced total power liabilities of $3.7bn as of the middle of last week \u2014 is late on paying $492mn to Adani, to whom it owes as much as $800mn in total.\n\nHe said the interim government had approached lenders including the World Bank for billions of dollars in loans to help stabilise its finances. \u201cSince joining [the government], we\u2019ve been firefighting,\u201d Khan said.\n\nBangladesh, the world\u2019s second-largest garments exporter, has grown rapidly in recent years but has suffered chronic energy shortages due to falling domestic gas reserves. Critics said measures passed by Sheikh Hasina \u2014 ostensibly aimed at speeding up projects, such as by bypassing open tendering \u2014 facilitated rampant corruption.\n\nAdani is one of India\u2019s most active conglomerates, with investments in everything from ports to data centres.

Adani has denied the allegations.\n\nAdani\u2019s Godda deal was agreed during a 2015 visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Dhaka. Activists have repeatedly criticised the project, which became fully operational last year, saying the high cost of importing power from Godda did not make sense for Bangladesh. Adani said its \u201ccost of power is very competitive when compared to the other imported coal-based power plants\u201d.\n\nKhan said Yunus\u2019s administration would reintroduce competitive bidding, empower regulators and establish an expert committee to re-examine energy deals negotiated under the previous government.\n\n\u201cThis is for all the transactions.

India, in particular, is hoping for a better ranking than the 71st place it garnered at the Olympics \u2014 below tiny Dominica and North Korea. It looks promising. Its medal tally is already higher. Para shooter Avani Lekhara\u2019s second successive gold medal has been the country\u2019s highlight so far.\n\nBut whether it is the Paralympics or Olympics, India underwhelms on the global sports stage, relative to its demographic heft. It has won just 41 medals at the Olympics since 1900. On the balance of probability alone \u2014 accounting for 1 in 6 people in the world \u2014 the nation\u2019s recent performance is embarrassing. It amassed just six medals at the Olympics this year.\n\nOf course, athletic prowess depends on far more than people power. For instance, America sent over five times the number of athletes India did to this year\u2019s Olympics, despite having just a quarter of its population. Indeed, Rory Green, chief China economist at TS Lombard, finds that GDP explained about 90 per cent of the variation in medal counts at the Paris games. But, India is also the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. If it has the people and the money, why is it so bad at sport?\n\nSuccess at the Olympics tends to scale with GDP partly because it acts as a proxy for sport expenditure. \u201cCapital-intensive sports \u2014 including gymnastics, sailing, swimming, rowing and diving \u2014 accounted for 28 per cent of available medals this year,\u201d notes Green. America, China and Britain excel in many of these. \u201cEconomic development also means more leisure time and the creation of a sporting culture.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s economic emergence has, however, not translated into stronger investment in sport, or more recreation. Expenditure on physical recreation has not been a priority for successive governments. As a result, wannabe athletes have faced significant hurdles in the form of poor funding and a lack of access to facilities, coaching and equipment.\n\nPoverty remains a challenge. India\u2019s GDP per capita by purchasing power parity is just over $10,000, according to the World Bank, placing it below the likes of Iraq and Eswatini. Parents and teachers, understandably, encourage children to pursue better paid, high-status professions as doctors and engineers.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, jobs that involve performing for others, such as domestic work, dance, and sports were often associated with lower status,\u201d says Dr Gurnam Singh, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Warwick.\n\nThere is a self-reinforcing dynamic here, too. A lack of national sporting role models (beyond cricket and chess) means the risk-reward ratio for making a living as an athlete continues to look unfavourable.\n\nSocietal expectations to get a degree, accumulate wealth and look after family mean Indians also tend to dedicate less time to sport in their daily life compared with peer nations. Women face different pressures; to marry and bear children at a young age which hinders sporting ambitions. And cricket has also become so dominant in India that few look to other sports.\n\nThere are, however, reasons to be optimistic. Indian officials increasingly recognise the soft power and economic opportunities that sport brings. National sporting budgets have increased in recent years, and programmes including \u201cKhelo India\u201d \u2014 which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2017 \u2014 aim to unearth and nurture young sporting talent.\n\nBusinesses also want to tap into India\u2019s large, young market for sporting goods and viewers. Just last month, sport retailer Decathlon announced a \u20ac100mn investment in the country. Sport industry revenues \u2014 including media spending and sponsorship \u2014 have more than doubled since 2014.\n\nIndia has also declared interest in hosting the 2036 summer Olympics. A bid could support its sporting status. Green notes that higher medal tallies for host countries are less about home advantage, and more to do with the investment that goes into sport ahead of the event.\n\nTurning India\u2019s athletic woes around will take time and persistence. It notched a national record number of fourth place finishes at this year\u2019s Olympics, but getting into the medal spots warrants ongoing investment in training and preparation. Success on the global stage, alongside continued championing of sport by India\u2019s leaders, may then be necessary to change attitudes towards athletic pursuits.\n\nUntil then, India can at least look forward to the return of cricket to the Olympics for Los Angeles 2028, after a 128-year hiatus.\n\ntej.parikh@ft.com\n\nFollow Tej Parikh with\u00a0myFT\u00a0and on\u00a0X\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nWhat India\u2019s emerging chess prowess tells us\u00a0/\u00a0From Harshita Jain, London W8, UK", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4d8e0119-fa6c-4bbb-aa15-56e85dd30f2d"}}, {"id": "594fd7d1-4a9d-4062-b880-6d3c7e67ca66", "event_name": "Russia built covert trade channel with India, leaks reveal", "blurb": "Files outline Moscow\u2019s plan to spend rupees from oil sales on sensitive electronics for war effort", "date": "2024-09-0400:00:00.0", "body": "Russia has been secretly acquiring sensitive goods in India and explored building facilities in the country to secure components for its war effort, according to Russian state correspondence seen by the Financial Times.\n\nMoscow\u2019s industry and trade ministry, which oversees defence production to support Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, drew up confidential plans in October 2022 to spend about Rs82bn ($1bn at the time) on securing critical electronics through channels hidden from western governments.\n\nThe plan, revealed in letters to a shadowy trade promotion body with strong links to the Russian security services, aimed to use \u201csignificant reserves\u201d of rupees amassed by Russian banks from booming oil sales to India. It saw India as an alternative market to source crucial goods \u201cpreviously supplied from unfriendly countries\u201d.\n\nRussia and its Indian partners targeted dual-use technologies \u2014 goods with both civilian and military applications \u2014 that are subject to western export controls, according to the documents, as well as western officials and two businessmen formerly involved in the trade. Moscow even envisaged pumping investment into Russo-Indian electronics development and production facilities, according to the leaked files.\n\nThe correspondence shows how Russia turned to New Delhi, even as Narendra Modi, the prime minister, brought the world\u2019s most populous country closer than ever into the US orbit. During a state visit to Washington last year Modi signed a series of Indo-American co-operation agreements in areas ranging from advanced jet engines to artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile the extent to which Moscow enacted its plan is unclear, detailed trade flow data suggest the relationship with India has grown deeper in the specific categories of goods identified in the Russian correspondence.\n\nIndia\u2019s ties with Moscow have been a growing source of friction with Washington. Wally Adeyemo, the US deputy treasury secretary, wrote in July to three of India\u2019s top business organisations warning them that \u201cany foreign financial institution that does business with Russia\u2019s military industrial base risks being sanctioned itself\u201d.\n\nAdeyemo added: \u201cThis heightened sanctions risk exists regardless of the currency used in a transaction.\u201d\n\nWhile Modi has bemoaned the impact on developing economies of the invasion of Ukraine and urged the two sides to make peace, Delhi extended an economic lifeline to Russia after it was hit by western sanctions.\n\nIndia has been a major buyer of Russian crude oil and the two countries\u2019 total trade reached an all-time high of $66bn in the 2023-24 financial year, a fivefold increase on the past year before the invasion. Some of the trade has been transacted in rupees, leaving Russia with a surplus of the currency.\n\nThe Kremlin has admitted difficulties in repatriating Russia\u2019s oil profits because of US sanctions and currency restrictions. Russian groups have used rupees to trade gold and purchase goods to evade the sanctions, according to people involved in the trade and western officials.\n\nThe Russian central government official involved in the leaked correspondence, Alexander Gaponov, is deputy head of the ministry\u2019s \u201cradio-electronics\u201d division. It is an area of particular sensitivity because Russia is reliant on foreign-produced electronics for use in missiles, drones and electronic warfare.\n\nGaponov in October 2022 asked an opaque Moscow-based organisation with ties to Russian security services \u2014 the Consortium for Foreign Economic Activity and International Interstate Cooperation in Industry \u2014 to present plans for acquiring critical components from India.\n\nVadim Poida, the consortium\u2019s president, replied that it had developed \u201cspecific plans\u201d with the Russian electronics industry and \u201crepresentatives of the relevant Indian state and private businesses\u201d that had \u201chigh potential\u201d for making use of the Kremlin\u2019s rupees.\n\nPoida outlined a five-stage plan to help Russia spend its rupees and establish a steady supply of dual-use components. Russia would set up a \u201cclosed payment system between Russian and Indian companies\u201d beyond the oversight of western countries, \u201cincluding by using digital financial assets\u201d, Poida wrote.\n\nPoida\u2019s consortium estimated Russia could purchase up to Rbs100bn of components, including parts for \u201ctelecommunication, server, and other complex electronic equipment\u201d previously bought through western countries.\n\nIts members, Poida wrote, had begun pilot projects for producing Russian-designed components in India and conducted \u201cdetailed work on the issue of hiding information about the participation of Russian individuals and corporate entities, as well as the logistics of supply via third countries\u201d.\n\nAdditional funds could be spent on backing joint ventures in India for electronics factories needed \u201cto meet the needs of Russian critical information infrastructure\u201d.\n\nThe consortium\u2019s legal entity was set up in 2013, nominally as a vehicle for app development. Poida took it over and renamed it in March of 2022, less than a month after Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. One western official confirmed the group, which mentions meetings involving the security services in the leaked correspondence, is a front for Russian intelligence.\n\nThe leaked exchange of letters mentions paying for two specific customs categories of goods, types of electronics and machinery, in rupees. Russian filings show that trade in these categories has soared from negligible volumes in mid-2022.\n\nCustoms filings also reveal specific items that potentially match the project\u2019s activities. Innovio Ventures, an Indian company, was listed in trade declarations as the supplier of at least $4.9mn of electronic equipment, including drones, to Russia as well as $600,000 of goods shipped to Kyrgyzstan. The transactions were listed in Russian filings as settled in rupees.\n\nThe shipments to Russia include $568,000 of electronic equipment for use in radio-electronic systems to a Russian company called Testkomplekt, which has been hit by US and EU sanctions for being at the heart of Moscow\u2019s military procurement system.\n\nAn Indian businessman familiar with Russia\u2019s trade with India said Moscow had also done scoping work to establish facilities in India.\n\n\u201cPart of this [rupee pile] was to be deployed in India for coming up with the necessary manufacturing of dual-use items,\u201d the Indian businessman said. \u201cIt could be low-value electronics items like the ones found in washing machines or refrigerators.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could either export these items, or take the electronics out and send them to Russia,\u201d he added.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/101afcd6-8e6f-4b5f-89b0-98f48cd5d119"}}, {"id": "4b593247-e500-4a04-aac5-51b1ca9c2bfe", "event_name": "France\u2019s Total pursues Adani ties with new solar investment ", "blurb": "Energy company has sought tie-ups with the Indian group despite last year\u2019s fraud allegations ", "date": "2024-09-0300:00:00.0", "body": "French oil and gas major TotalEnergies has struck a new deal with a green energy division of Indian billionaire Gautam Adani\u2019s conglomerate and will invest $444mn in a joint portfolio of solar power projects.\n\nTotal is one of the non-Indian companies that has visibly pursued collaborations with the Adani Group since the conglomerate faced corporate fraud allegations last year from US short seller Hindenburg Research.

Dressed in full clean-room attire, including a suit, boots, head covering, mask and gloves, I toured the facility and learned about several key chipmaking processes.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the tour was the high-temperature furnaces, which operate at up to 2,000C. One of the chip experts described them as like \u201crice cookers cooking rice\u201d. I also observed wet stations, where chemicals are applied to wafers.\n\nThe hourlong tour was extremely educational, but I began to feel dizzy near the end because the head-to-toe outfit was hard to breathe in. The experience reminded me of how demanding semiconductor manufacturing is, where strict protocols must be followed to prevent even the smallest particles from contaminating the production environment. It was hard to imagine engineers and technicians working here up to eight hours a day, taking day and night shifts to keep the plant up and running 24/7.\n\nLast week, a friend shared photos of the baroque Frauenkirche church, the Royal Palace and gorgeous gardens taken during his visit to Dresden for TSMC\u2019s groundbreaking ceremony for its first European chip plant. The picturesque riverside city along the Elbe, with its clear blue skies and relaxing atmosphere, made him wonder why anyone would choose to work in a chip factory there. \u201cI\u2019d rather be having a picnic than be stuck in a cleanroom. This serene environment could be a threat to competitiveness,\u201d he joked.\n\nWhoever I speak with in the tech supply chain lists the same factors for success in this, or any, industry: culture, talent and infrastructure. For example, I heard that at TSMC\u2019s Arizona plant, high-priority meetings are often conducted in Mandarin, with only Taiwanese staff present to facilitate communication. This demonstrates the challenges of integrating into a new culture and becoming more international.\n\nA conversation with executives from ASE Technology Holding, the world\u2019s largest chip packaging and testing company, highlighted the importance of infrastructure. The company has been investing in the US and recently acquired land in Kitakyushu for its Japan expansion.\n\nIn Asia, ASE has operations in the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and China. A company executive said that because chip packaging typically has lower profit margins and a lower level of automation compared to chip manufacturing, it is one of the most challenging parts of the supply chain for the US and Europe to onshore.\n\n\u201cThe necessary technical infrastructure for advanced chip packaging is simply not as developed in the US and Europe,\u201d the executive said. So even if chip production increases in these regions, the majority of packaging will likely continue to be done in Asia.\n\nApple has begun assembling its latest iPhone 16 series, including the premium Pro models, in India, Nikkei Asia\u2019s Lauly Li and Cheng Ting-Fang write. This marks a significant milestone, as India is now producing Apple\u2019s highest-end iPhones almost simultaneously with China, the company\u2019s primary manufacturing hub.\n\nIn the past, India focused on assembling older iPhone models, lagging behind China. However, this gap has narrowed significantly over the past year. While India has made progress, its capability to produce more valuable components remains limited. Most of the electronic components are still manufactured in China and assembled into modules before being shipped to India for final assembly.\n\nApple has also placed substantial orders with its suppliers for the iPhone 16 series, hinting that it expects strong sales, particularly for the premium models with new Apple Intelligence features. The company has forecast production orders for between 88mn and 90mn units, with some suppliers receiving even higher estimates.\n\nChina\u2019s top tech players are going all-in on AI, doubling their capital spending to $7bn in the first half of 2023, according to the Financial Times\u2019 Ryan McMorrow and Eleanor Olcott.\n\nCompanies including Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance and Baidu are pouring cash into buying processors and infrastructure to power advanced AI models, despite US sanctions that aim to stymie China\u2019s efforts in the field.\n\nAlibaba alone boosted its spending by 123 per cent from a year earlier. Its business renting AI GPUs to start-ups is finally starting to reinvigorate its cloud arm.\n\nTikTok parent ByteDance is also investing heavily, leveraging its $50bn cash pile to build AI infrastructure in China and Malaysia. The company is a major buyer of Nvidia\u2019s throttled for-China chip called the H20.\n\nHowever, Chinese tech groups\u2019 spending still pales in comparison to US tech giants, which collectively shelled out $106bn in the first half of the year.\n\nA fire sparked by a Mercedes-Benz electric car in the port city of Incheon has sent shockwaves through South Korea\u2019s auto market. The country has been a leader in EV adoption, driven by government incentives and a strong battery and car industry. The incident could also have global implications and ripple effects for EV and battery manufacturers, Nikkei Asia\u2019s Kim Jaewon writes.\n\nMercedes-Benz and South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor were both in the global top 10 for EV shipments in the first half of 2024.\n\nIn response to the fire, South Korean policymakers moved to require all EV makers to disclose their battery suppliers. Mercedes-Benz\u2019s EQE 350+ model, the one involved in the incident, used a battery from China\u2019s Farasis Energy, while Hyundai\u2019s primary supplier is SK On, a South Korean company. LG Energy Solutions and China\u2019s CATL are also major suppliers for Hyundai.\n\nWhile the fire has led to some negative press for EVs, some battery makers, such as LG Energy Solutions, have used the opportunity to highlight their own safety records and battery management systems with an eye towards expanding their market share.\n\nNvidia reported another blockbuster quarterly earnings on strong demand for AI computing. Even its sales to the China market \u2014 where it must offer downgraded versions of some chips to comply with US export controls \u2014 increased on the year, Yifan Yu of Nikkei Asia writes.\n\nBut investors, who have become used to expecting the incredible from Nvidia, were less than impressed. Many are now sceptical of how long the AI demand boom will continue, as most tech companies are still struggling to monetise the new technology. Nvidia\u2019s share price tumbled in after-hours trading, dragging down stocks in Asia\u2019s morning trading.\n\nThe company reported $3.7bn in revenue from China, a 33.8 per cent year-over-year increase and a 47.2 per cent increase from the previous quarter. China accounted for up to 25 per cent of data centre revenue, primarily driven by AI computing. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress acknowledged China\u2019s significant contribution to the company\u2019s data centre business for the quarter but also noted that it was below pre-export control levels and competition in the market was growing.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/bbe66489-4e1f-4249-a4ea-4ad45b14e607"}}, {"id": "a798c363-5f01-4850-9e95-a2c0709d4fb3", "event_name": "Foreign investors pull out of frothy Indian equity market", "blurb": "Year-to-date inflows of $2.6bn are below the $22bn recorded in 2023", "date": "2024-08-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Foreign investors are pulling money out of India\u2019s equity market, cutting their exposure as the US interest rate cycle turns and millions of domestic savers continue to pile into richly valued stocks.\n\nForeign institutional investors have turned net sellers of India-listed shares in August, with net outflows of more than $1bn, according to data from Bloomberg and the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Year-to-date inflows stood at $2.6bn, well below the $22bn recorded last year.\n\nThe shift comes after years of strong domestic stock market performance, particularly the blue-chip Nifty 50 index. Overseas investors sought returns outside China, where the economy has struggled for momentum since the pandemic. India\u2019s weighting in international indices rose to reflect the inflow of money while new domestic investors also helped to drive up valuations.\n\nThe country\u2019s large internal market and rapid economic growth also insulated it from steep US interest rate rises in 2022 and 2023, which helped to pull money from many emerging markets.\n\n\u201cThis is a story of India being in outperformance during this [Federal Reserve] hiking cycle, with geopolitical tailwinds.

2022, a net $70bn of domestic retail money has flowed into Indian equities, said Australian bank Macquarie in a recent note.\n\nLocal institutional investors are also struggling to find value in the

a $8.5bn merger of their local entertainment businesses, clearing a major hurdle to the deal following concerns about dominance over cricket broadcasting.\n\nThe Competition Commission of India on Wednesday gave the go-ahead to the proposed merger subject to voluntary commitments from the companies.\n\nOfficials were concerned about the control Disney and entities largely owned by Reliance, the oil-to-telecoms conglomerate run by India\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani, would exert over the streaming and broadcast rights to international cricket and the wildly popular domestic Indian Premier League T20 tournament.\n\nThe breakthrough came after the companies agreed to shut down a handful of regional TV channels out of their portfolio of more than 100 stations, people close to the companies said.\n\nThe groups also assured the regulator they would not bundle advertisements across their cricket portfolio or raise advertising rates exponentially.\n\nThe merged powerhouse would have had a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d presence in some parts of the country such as Maharashtra \u2014 India\u2019s richest state \u2014 where it accounted for about half the market, one of the

responsibly and not raise the rates unreasonably.\u201d\n\nThe move paves the way for the creation of an unrivalled Indian entertainment giant in the world\u2019s most populous nation, which has lured global media majors, including Netflix and Sony, that have nonetheless struggled to crack the country\u2019s fast-growing but highly price-conscious market.\n\nMihir Shah, vice-president at

entertainment group over the financial underperformance of its India business after acquiring Star India in 2019.\n\nThe decisive blow came in 2022 after Disney lost the five-year IPL streaming rights to Viacom18, a joint venture mainly involving Reliance\u2019s JioCinema, in a record $6.2bn auction. Although Disney kept the tournament on its TV network, JioCinema broadcast the tournament for free to Indian cricket fans who are increasingly watching matches on their mobile phones.\n\nThe announcement will cheer Ambani ahead of his address to shareholders on Thursday at Reliance\u2019s annual meeting, where the billionaire is known for making grand statements and outlining strategy.\n\nTwo people familiar with the matter expressed surprise at the speed of the CCI\u2019s approval, given its apprehensions.\n\nThe merger could now be concluded before the end of the year, the people said, with final approval expected to come from India\u2019s information and broadcast ministry following the antitrust regulator\u2019s nod.\n\nDisney declined to comment.

But for all the pledges, the Modi Indians heard was not the reformer they once knew.\n\nThe Indian leader typically deploys the address to outline his grand visions for the world\u2019s most populous country. Last year he vowed to make India a developed economy by 2047. This year\u2019s speech, with ample references to Viksit Bharat (\u201cDeveloped India\u201d) was a record 98 minutes long.\n\nBut Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party lost its majority in June for the first time in a decade and is now having to consult allies, and sometimes retreat, on legislation. Recently it has made U-turns on bills that in the past it would have confidently pushed through parliament.\n\nSo while he declares a commitment to \u201cmajor reforms\u201d, analysts say, Modi will have to work harder than before to prevail against a reinvigorated opposition led by Rahul Gandhi. His premiership, in its third term, is a diminished one.\n\nMore ominously perhaps for the powerful and popular prime minister, some leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Hindu nationalist mass movement behind the BJP, made remarks that Indians interpreted as expressing impatience with Modi since the general election result was announced on June 4.\n\n\u201cHe had very big plans and the loss of 60 seats in parliament has put a lot of that on hold,\u201d says Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, Eurasia Group\u2019s south Asia practice head. \u201cHe has to contend with partners, with the RSS, and just generally an opposition that is more energised.\u201d\n\nModi\u2019s leftwing critics are delighted to see a leader they describe as an authoritarian strongman weakened.\n\nBusiness leaders and analysts, meanwhile, are puzzling over what the changed electoral arithmetic will mean for a pro-big business leader who had an ambitious third-term agenda for the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, Modi instructed his ministries to come up with 100-day action plans to push through the BJP\u2019s legislative and administrative programme in its first three months. These included proposals to create \u201csuper-ministries\u201d for areas such as technology, with the aim of streamlining the government\u2019s work.\n\nOfficials no longer speak about a 100-day agenda. And following the BJP\u2019s shock loss of its majority, he was compelled to dole out some government posts to junior coalition partners, making the plan for mega-ministries unworkable.\n\nThe Modi government recently sent back for further revision a broadcasting bill that would have brought YouTubers and other content creators under tighter regulatory control, following a backlash from civil society groups and questions from business.\n\nAfter an outcry from middle-class Indians, his government also scrapped plans for an overhaul of the long-term capital gains tax outlined in last month\u2019s budget. A scheme to allow \u201clateral\u201d entry to the civil service for non-bureaucrats was sunk by the Gandhi-led opposition, who questioned why it did not include \u201creservations\u201d for lower-caste Indians. The plan was even criticised by some Modi allies.\n\nBoth measures arguably would have been good for India\u2019s finances and the quality of its governance, with lateral entry allowing more private sector technocrats to become involved in public administration.\n\nThe business community has been hoping for forward movement on policies such as privatisation, land and labour market reform, and an overhaul of production-linked incentives \u2014 the multibillion-dollar subsidies India uses to lure investors in industries such as mobile phones and microchips.\n\nAnalysts say that the Modi government\u2019s forward momentum will depend in large part on the outcome of upcoming state elections \u2014 the biggest being in Maharashtra, one of India\u2019s wealthiest and biggest states, expected in November.\n\nEven sooner, an upcoming by-election for 12 seats in the Rajya Sabha or upper house, scheduled for September 3, could provide either a small lift or loss to the BJP in the 245-seat upper house.\n\nSeasoned political observers point out that a weaker Modi governing in a coalition is no great matter. It simply makes him a more typical Indian leader.\n\nP.V. Narasimha Rao, the Indian National Congress party prime minister elected in 1991, credited with India\u2019s \u201cbig bang\u201d economic reforms, presided over a minority government. Even Modi, when the BJP enjoyed a majority, was unable to have his way on ambitious reforms to the crucial farming sector.\n\n\u201cAs far as economic policy is concerned, it doesn\u2019t matter which government is in power,\u201d says Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist with GlobalData.TSLombard. \u201cIndia with its very vibrant democracy and the multiple stakeholders involved means that the pace of reforms will always be very incremental.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f4caa4d3-2618-48e2-b1c2-890a08362ac9"}}, {"id": "c7de01dd-d9ee-4a2b-bda0-9b811b1c1317", "event_name": "India\u2019s broadcasting bill is an exercise in state control", "blurb": "Government efforts to regulate broadcasters, including individual YouTubers, is part of a bigger plan to censor content ", "date": "2024-08-1900:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is policy and campaigns officer at Index on Censorship\n\nPolicymakers\u2019 favourite metaphor for online spaces is the \u201cwild west\u201d, a description that presents online behaviour as the activities of lawless gunslingers and themselves as the grizzled sheriff sent in to re-establish order.\n\nIn this limited view, online speech regulation is shorn of all nuance or complexity. Instead, it is pitched as a battle between harmony and lawlessness, good and bad. Nowhere is this more apparent than India.\n\nLast week, the Indian government withdrew the broadcasting services (regulation) bill 2024 following heavy criticism. But withdrawal does not mark the end of the government\u2019s ambition to control online speech.\n\nThe broadcasting bill proposed giving the government expansive powers and included vaguely defined provisions that left individual content creators, alongside platforms, at the mercy of an untested regulatory framework.\n\nWhile previous versions of the bill were limited to \u201ccitizens of India\u201d, the 2024 version removed this limit, suggesting global applicability. It also expanded the definition of broadcasting to include text, as well as \u201caudio, visual or audio-visual\u201d programmes, meaning that it would cover every type of online content.\n\nPrior to the broadcasting bill, the Indian government\u2019s most prominent attempt to wrest control of the internet came with the 2021 IT Rules. This was updated with plans for a digital India bill (DIB), which sought to expand on the IT Act, all under the guise of limiting the influence of US tech giants. It did little to acknowledge the fact that making platforms liable for the content they host would increase private censorship.\n\nTo escape liability, platforms would have had to be more proactive in removing content and accounts.\n\nWhile the DIB was never published, the broadcasting bill has reignited this debate. Its attempt to establish a regulatory regime for all broadcasters or network operators, including individual YouTubers, social media users and online media outlets, represented an exercise in state control. While a previous draft published in 2023 was open to public consultation, the latest version was only shared with a select few. Each version was given a specific marker: if it was leaked, the authorities would have the fingerprint of the leaker.\n\nEven with such control, information got out; opposition leaders, civil society and content creators were quick to condemn it. Congress party spokesperson Pawan Khera called the bill a \u201cdirect threat to our freedom of speech and independent media\u201d.\n\nAs magazine editor Anant Nath pointed out during a press conference organised by the non-profit DIGIPUB News India Foundation, the broadcasting bill was only one part of a larger project. \u201cThis broadcast bill is one more step in creating a multi-layered legal system to regulate, control, monitor and censor content in the country, which started from the IT Rules 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government\u2019s plans to control online speech are still up in the air. While the 2021 IT Rules are being challenged in court, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has confirmed stakeholders can submit feedback on the broadcasting bill by October 15 but has not confirmed the version being used and has not opened it up to consultation by the public.\n\nHowever, the future of these bills matters less than the intent that underpins them. While the mobilisation of civil society, content creators, advocates, campaigners and broadcasters was vital in highlighting the flaws in the broadcasting bill, the signal to be vigilant remains lit.\n\nThe government\u2019s urge to create new regulation has not been quelled. All that has been signalled is that these particular bills were imperfect vehicles for the government\u2019s plan to censor and control online speech.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/cb8590f8-7314-4d6d-ab1b-d9de9b29b771"}}, {"id": "f1abc71a-f90f-4219-9e86-0c76da6cc8b5", "event_name": "How India can create more jobs", "blurb": "A drive to attract factories must not overlook the country\u2019s huge potential in services", "date": "2024-08-1800:00:00.0", "body": "India celebrated 77 years of independence last week. By its centennial, in 2047, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants the country to become a \u201ccompletely developed nation\u201d. Based on current trends, however, it could take another 75 years for India just to reach one-quarter of America\u2019s income per capita, according to the World Bank. To change the arithmetic, India must capitalise on its labour force \u2014 one of the youngest and largest in the world.\n\nA vast labour supply of over half a billion is both an opportunity and a challenge. It can support economic growth, provided there are enough worthwhile jobs to fill. But it also brings huge political pressures, as Modi found out after his Bharatiya Janata party lost its parliamentary majority in a shock election result in June. The vote reflected rising frustration over the lack of well-paid work opportunities. Rising food prices made matters worse. The jobless rate averaged around 8 per cent in the 12 months to June.\n\nIndia\u2019s jobs challenge is stark. A recent study by Natixis, a bank, estimated that the country needs to create 115mn jobs by 2030 to absorb its growing population. That means the economy producing 16.5mn jobs per year, a significant step up on the 12.4mn annual average for the last decade.\n\nIn a sign that the election result has humbled Modi, the government\u2019s budget last month outlined several initiatives to jump-start jobs growth. It set aside $24bn for job creation, covering employment and training incentives. It is a start, but there are no quick fixes.\n\nIndia is, however, well positioned to benefit from global economic shifts, which it can leverage over time to deliver more jobs. The country is attracting businesses keen to diversify their manufacturing supply chains, as part of \u201cChina Plus One\u201d strategies. For instance, Foxconn, the electronics group, has been expanding in the country. Factories create jobs at scale, particularly for lower-skilled workers. Rather than wasting funds on subsidies, India can appeal to more manufacturers by investing in its road, rail and ports and by slashing import tariffs, which benefit its wider economy too.\n\nBut greater focus should also be placed on driving high-skill, high-pay employment opportunities. India is well set up to benefit from the rising global trade in higher value-added services. It has one of the largest numbers of graduates in Stem \u2014 science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2014 fields in the world. Multinationals ranging from Google to Walmart have set up \u201cglobal capability centres\u201d in India, which tap into its talent for data analysis, and research and development. Still, the International Labour Organization recently estimated the jobless rate for graduates to be around 29 per cent.\n\nIndia has the potential to become the world\u2019s research hub. But getting there warrants continued efforts to support the private sector, including by streamlining red tape around planning and foreign investment. Closer connections between India\u2019s technical colleges, employers and investors can help support better job-matching, continued skills development, and start-up growth \u2014 which can turn jobseekers into job creators.\n\nIn the longer term, India needs to invest in better education and support women to enter the formal workforce to shift more of its population away from precarious work. That will support income growth, and in turn drive further job creation.\n\nHaving millions of workers in poorly paid, informal work, and talented graduates with too few jobs to go into is a major problem for the BJP. It is also an enormous waste of talent for India, and the world. Just as the nation tapped into globalisation in the 1990s to drive jobs and growth, it needs once again to ride the wave of global trends to take advantage of its \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/669ff153-3254-4e74-bd60-9d1d7da3b23e"}}, {"id": "9c975bd4-9c78-43cb-8d98-56b82e08d091", "event_name": "Tata shows interest in India\u2019s ageing state power distributors", "blurb": "Conglomerate\u2019s energy arm anticipates sell-offs will follow reforms to tackle the country\u2019s unreliable electricity supply", "date": "2024-08-1800:00:00.0", "body": "Tata Sons has expressed interest in buying some of India\u2019s debt-laden, state-owned power distribution companies, some of which could be sold off as part of a potentially contentious reform process as the government attempts to ease blackouts and stem huge losses.\n\nTata Power, the more than century-old energy arm of the vast Indian conglomerate and one of the country\u2019s largest electricity providers, would consider expanding its distribution reach if public companies are put on the block, said its chief executive Praveer Sinha.\n\n\u201cOne of the areas that we are also expecting some movement is on distribution reforms,\u201d Sinha told the Financial Times at Tata\u2019s headquarters in Mumbai, while declining to comment on when that could happen.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last part of the power sector changes or transition that is expected,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are very confident that many of the reforms, which could not be completed, will happen.\u201d\n\nWith India rushing to meet ballooning energy demand as its economy rapidly expands, powerful domestic corporations, including Adani Group, Reliance Industries and Tata, are investing billions of dollars to help meet ambitious government targets.

Those ageing, investment-starved systems are in part blamed for power shortfalls and an unreliable electricity supply in many parts of India.\n\nThe industry\u2019s accumulated deficit shot up 62 per cent to $74.4bn in the six years to 2022, according to a study published earlier this year by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, which has recommended further privatisations.\n\nTata Power has considerable experience cutting power distribution\u2019s technical and commercial losses, including in the capital Delhi and the eastern state of Odisha, where it operates through majority partnerships with local governments.\n\nWhile industry aggregate loss rates have declined from 25 per cent to 15 per cent in the past decade, those levels still compare unfavourably with 5 per cent levels seen in China and the US, according to the CSIS.\n\n\u201cUnless they become profitable and they have the ability to take some more loans and implement new projects, it would be very difficult for them to come out of this challenge,\u201d Sinha said. \u201cIt\u2019s a catch-22 situation.\u201d\n\nBut wider transformation of the sector is politically fraught, with many state governments unwilling to relinquish levers that allow them to subsidise electricity. A law drafted two years ago, which aims to make private sector entry into power distribution easier and rationalise energy tariffs, has yet to be passed by India\u2019s parliament.\n\nA surprisingly poor electoral showing last month, which saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata party lose its parliamentary majority, has also placed in doubt the central government\u2019s ability to ram through politically sensitive reforms or coerce states to implement difficult policies.\n\nVibhuti Garg, South Asia director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, called the problems in the sector \u201ca political economy issue\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of resistance from states,\u201d she said. But \u201cto improve efficiency\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we need more money to be pumped in and with limited financial resources from the government I think the private sector should play a role\u201d.\n\nTata Power is also scaling up its clean energy projects, which currently account for 38 per cent of its 14.7 gigawatt capacity, with the rest coming from thermal plants. Sinha said he expected Tata\u2019s renewable generation to overtake coal-fired energy capacity within five years.\n\nThe conglomerate\u2019s chair Natarajan Chandrasekaran announced last month that Tata Power would invest Rs200bn ($2.4bn) in capital expenditure in the financial year through March 2025, a 66 per cent increase from this year.\n\nSinha said 60 per cent of that spending would go to building out its green energy arm, which is less than a third of the size of its $4.3bn annual revenue transmission and distribution business where the rest of the funding will go.\n\nThe group is also exploring entry into nuclear power with small modular reactors. India\u2019s finance minister said last month that the government plans to open up the sector to private partnerships with nuclear generation \u201cexpected to form a significant part of the energy mix\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt the right time we will take a call, but that\u2019s definitely an area of interest,\u201d Sinha said. \u201cWe can come up with a very aggressive plan.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b05bc0b9-7773-4131-9f8d-9ceeb31749db"}}, {"id": "1f8dc291-268c-470c-9808-a880b20e1b80", "event_name": "India accuses Bangladesh\u2019s interim leaders of failing to protect Hindus", "blurb": "Rising tensions complicate attempts to mend a vital partnership after Sheikh Hasina was toppled ", "date": "2024-08-1800:00:00.0", "body": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s India has accused Bangladesh\u2019s new government of failing to protect the country\u2019s Hindu minority, fuelling tensions between the south Asian neighbours and key regional partners.\n\nSheikh Hasina, the former prime minister of Bangladesh who was toppled this month after weeks of protests, was close to New Delhi and a linchpin of India\u2019s strategy to counter China and Islamist extremism in South Asia.\n\nBut India\u2019s support for her increasingly autocratic government, which ordered a crackdown on student protesters that resulted in hundreds of deaths, has sparked widespread anger towards New Delhi in Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina fled to India last week.\n\nIn the ensuing violence, minorities including Hindus were attacked in many parts of Muslim-majority Bangladesh and hundreds reportedly massed at the Indian border to seek refuge in their predominantly Hindu neighbour. About 8 per cent of Bangladesh\u2019s 170mn-strong population is Hindu.\n\nThe attacks have caused alarm and fuelled hostility in India towards Bangladesh\u2019s interim leader Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist. Hindu groups have called for Modi\u2019s government to do more to protect them, with hundreds protesting in the Indian capital on Friday against the \u201catrocities\u201d in Bangladesh. Modi on Thursday said that \u201c1.4bn Indians are worried about the safety of the Hindus\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndians want the security of Hindus and minorities there to be ensured,\u201d said Modi, whose religious nationalist Bharatiya Janata party sees itself as a champion of Hindu interests.\n\nMany in Bangladesh, however, consider reports of rampant hate crimes part of a disinformation campaign by Sheikh Hasina\u2019s Awami League, arguing that incidents appeared to be motivated by political affiliation. The secular party draws considerable support from minorities, and some attacks were against Awami League leaders who were Hindu.\n\nThe allegations are a serious complication as the countries try to mend a vital partnership. Bangladesh relies on its larger neighbour for trade and investment and New Delhi wants stability to prevent chaos spilling over its borders.\n\nWith Bangladesh\u2019s police having gone into hiding after the former government\u2019s collapse, there is limited hard information on the scale of violence. Bangladeshi Hindu organisations said there had been more than 200 attacks against minorities since Sheikh Hasina\u2019s fall. Rights groups such as Amnesty International have called for investigations.\n\n\u201cOur homes, our shops and our temples have been vandalised,\u201d said Kajal Ghosh, a 46-year-old Hindu pharmacist who was among dozens who gathered in Dhaka to protest against the violence this week. \u201cPeople think that Hindus are supporters of the Awami League, so they tried to push us out of the country.\u201d\n\nTouhid Hossain, Bangladesh\u2019s interim foreign minister, told the Financial Times that regional policy would not necessarily change under Yunus. \u201cIndia is a very important neighbour to us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have grievances among the people about Indian conduct of Bangladesh policy, particularly in the last 10-15 years\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It\u2019s possible through friendly interaction between Bangladesh and India to remove these grievances.\u201d\n\nHossain said alleged incidents of violence received \u201cdisproportionate publicity in India\u201d and many \u201chave been because of political reasons, but not communal [religious] reasons\u201d. He said no violence was acceptable and vowed that the government was \u201chell bent\u201d on taking action against perpetrators.\n\nSheikh Hasina\u2019s ousting was a strategic setback to India, which considered the Awami League to be its most dependable regional partner. New Delhi helped Sheikh Hasina\u2019s father, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to break away from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nOfficials accused later governments led by rival parties such as the Bangladesh Nationalist party of being soft on China and extremism. Ties improved after Sheikh Hasina was elected in 2009, with India and its companies investing heavily to counterbalance China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative projects.\n\nMutual mistrust is now widespread. Rajot Shuvro Roy, a 21-year-old Bangladeshi Hindu student at Dhaka University who helped organise anti-Awami League protests, called the attacks on minorities \u201chorrific\u201d but said India was \u201cmaking some hyperbole\u201d over them. \u201cSheikh Hasina wants to tarnish the image of the interim government,\u201d he said.\n\nIn India, observers fear Yunus\u2019s interim government will be softer on Islamists and that elections will pave the way for the BNP\u2019s return to power.\n\nIndrani Bagchi, chief executive of the Ananta Aspen Centre, a New Delhi think-tank, said the violence was a \u201cmajor issue for a BJP government\u201d.\n\nA normalisation of the security situation, with many police stations reopening, should ease some of the strain. \u201cThe attacks on minority communities should die down,\u201d said Sarbhanu Nath, a research analyst at defence intelligence group Janes.\n\nBut Sheikh Hasina\u2019s continued presence in India is a complication. Bangladeshi authorities this week opened a murder investigation against the former prime minister for her alleged role in the police killing of a protester.\n\nThe two countries have an extradition treaty, but Sheikh Hasina\u2019s son Sajeeb Wazed told the FT that she has not sought asylum elsewhere and will stay in India \u201cas long as she wants to\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Indian government has always been a friend,\u201d he said.\n\nObservers said they expected both countries to recognise that they must re-establish trust, even if it takes time. \u201cThe stakes both in Bangladesh and India are too high for the relationship to fail or collapse,\u201d said Constantino Xavier, a senior fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cIndia has got this paranoia about pro-China sentiments in Bangladesh,\u201d one diplomat said, adding: \u201cThe Indians are smart enough to see that they have to accept the reality and work with the new government.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8c4b5078-ca21-4132-aad6-5120e975fbdf"}}, {"id": "7970c38b-1633-4bf0-a9b5-84c6f84cb802", "event_name": "Sunil Bharti Mittal, Indian telecoms tycoon turning the tables on BT", "blurb": "Company that drew investment from UK group in the 1990s is now becoming its biggest shareholder", "date": "2024-08-1600:00:00.0", "body": "On a 1997 visit to Bengaluru, then-UK prime minister John Major hailed BT\u2019s acquisition of a 21 per cent stake in a phone operator owned by Sunil Bharti Mittal as \u201can indication of the strength of our economy\u201d.\n\nNow Indian politicians are cheering a dramatic reversal after Mittal\u2019s Bharti Enterprises struck a deal to become the British former telecoms monopoly\u2019s largest investor, agreeing to buy a 24.5 per cent, roughly $4bn stake from Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi\u2019s indebted Altice.\n\nBharti Airtel, anchor of the 66-year-old Mittal\u2019s conglomerate, has blossomed since its 1995 founding into one of the world\u2019s biggest network providers and now dwarfs BT.\n\nWith 550mn customers across 17 South Asian and African nations, the company commands a $100bn market value \u2014 more than five times that of the UK group, which has shed overseas assets in recent years.\n\nMittal\u2019s purchase was greeted with glee at home, where it has been lauded as symbolic of India\u2019s increasing economic might and part of a trend of national champions acquiring emblematic assets from its former colonial master.\n\nCommerce minister Piyush Goyal reposted on X instructions made a decade ago by Prime Minister Narendra Modi: \u201cI want Indian companies to become multinational.\u201d\n\nA cross-border operator at ease navigating international political corridors, Mittal has been happy to fulfil that command, with an international deal spree well under way even before Modi came to power that included Bharti Airtel\u2019s $10.7bn deal in 2010 to take control of the African network owned by Kuwait\u2019s Zain.\n\nModi \u201cwants certain businesses to go outside of India and represent\u201d, said one person close to the billionaire. Bharti is \u201cone of those enterprises\u201d.\n\nMittal hails from the industrial city of Ludhiana in northern India, home to a mass of small-scale businesses that left a lasting mark. His late father was a member of parliament with the Indian National Congress, the party that dominated politics for decades after independence.\n\n\u201cHis parents have been quite influential,\u201d said Neil Shah, partner at technology consultancy Counterpoint Research. \u201cThey\u2019re very well connected.\u201d\n\nMittal\u2019s father was keen to establish a large family business, backing his teenage son\u2019s first foray manufacturing bicycle parts. During the socialist strictures of India\u2019s \u201cLicence Raj\u201d, which kept a lid on entrepreneurial ambition, the younger Mittal became adept at finding loopholes in labyrinthine regulations.\n\nHe won over indifferent bank managers, even playing table tennis with one to get cheques cleared. But his electric generator business was still quashed by a sudden import ban in the 1980s.\n\nMittal found his calling replacing old rotary-dial telephones prevalent in India, importing components for push-button phones after coming across them during a trip to Taiwan. As India\u2019s economy was prised open during the reformist 1990s, Mittal bid for a private telecom licence, setting in motion a nationwide technological transformation.\n\nBut as his telecoms business flourished, many of his conglomerate\u2019s moves in other areas, such as food and retail, floundered. Bharti\u2019s efforts to bring Walmart to India, a nation where retail remains dominated by small family-owned shops, sparked protests in 2007 in which effigies of the two companies\u2019 executives were burnt. The partnership ended six years later after New Delhi probed the US group for potential violations of foreign ownership rules. Such struggles partly explain why he is sticking to the industry he knows best.\n\nMittal\u2019s greatest challenger remains Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, with whom he started skirmishing in the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cAm I scared? No. Am I concerned? Yes,\u201d Mittal said in 2016 as Ambani\u2019s new carrier Jio sparked a price war that whittled down India\u2019s roughly dozen operators.\n\nBharti Airtel\u2019s size helped it weather that storm, according to Shah, cementing itself as India\u2019s second-largest network and settling into a near duopoly with its arch-rival. One banker whose company has worked with Bharti said Mittal \u201chas to live in the shadow of Jio and Mr Ambani\u201d.\n\nThe urbane billionaire\u2019s family background has imbued him with an interest in international politics. He was previously a trustee at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and sits on advisory boards from the US Council for Foreign Relations to Hakluyt, a London-based consultancy founded by former MI6 intelligence officers.\n\nIn the UK, where two of his three children are settled, Mittal received an honorary knighthood this year and has pushed for a conclusion to a trade deal being hashed out between London and New Delhi.\n\nBut beyond his sentimentality towards the UK \u2014 where investments include Scotland\u2019s upmarket Gleneagles resort, The Hoxton hotel chain and satellite company OneWeb \u2014 the strategic motivation for the BT deal remains unclear.\n\nMittal, who has said he does not intend to take control of the company and has not negotiated board seats, has been coy about the ultimate ambitions behind his highest-profile move in Britain. Analysts speculate that he may mount a tie-up with OneWeb, which has stolen a march in India\u2019s satellite internet race.\n\nThe billionaire says he is investing in BT for the long haul, backing chief executive Allison Kirkby\u2019s cost-cutting and fibre network spending strategy, while praising the UK\u2019s investment climate.\n\n\u201cThere are not too many opportunities like this where you can get a block of shares in an iconic company,\u201d said the person familiar with the tycoon.

I\u2019m Tej Parikh, the FT\u2019s economics leader writer, and it's my turn to regale you in Martin\u2019s absence.\n\nThe timing is sound. India is celebrating its 78th Independence Day today. Everyone knows the story: it\u2019s the world\u2019s most populous nation, one of the fastest-growing economies, the third-largest by gross domestic product in purchasing power parity terms, and a touted beneficiary of \u201cChina Plus One\u201d supply chain diversification.\n\nThe optimistic vision of India as an emerging economic rival to the US, EU and China has, however, been held for a while. There have been many false dawns. But, in keeping with the festive moment, and in my regular format of looking for alt-narratives, I sought out some data points that put India\u2019s economic potential in a different light.\n\nThe idea of India as the world\u2019s back office and call centre needs updating. Multinationals are increasingly tapping into the nation\u2019s tech-savvy talent to develop \u201cglobal capability centres\u201d for their organisations. These hubs conduct more lucrative activities for companies, including design, research and development, and data analysis \u2014 skills that are often costlier and in shorter supply back home.\n\nTop companies including IBM, Google, Goldman Sachs and Novartis have set up GCCs in the country. India accounted for more than 45 per cent of the GCCs in the world outside of the home country in early 2023, according to Ernst & Young. It is also home to some of the world\u2019s largest IT services companies, such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro.\n\nIf China is the workshop of the world, India could become its research hub. The country\u2019s share of world services exports has grown steadily over the past two decades, driven by a surge in professional consulting activities, particularly in IT. This looks set to continue.\n\nWhy does this matter? Well, exposure to the growing, high-value added global services trade, is promising for India\u2019s economic trajectory, says Rohit Lamba, an assistant professor of economics at Cornell University and former economist at the office of the chief economic adviser to the government of India.\n\n\u201cMost countries that have grown rapidly since the industrial\u00a0revolution have done so through the standard structural transformation route of vesting agricultural surplus into low-skilled manufacturing such as textiles, and then eventually high-skilled manufacturing and services,\u201d says Lamba,\n\nThe likes of Japan, South Korea and China were able to make the first step much faster than the US and Europe. But Lamba says India has leapfrogged the standard route.\n\n\u201cMissing the manufacturing bus may have had its problems in more unequal distribution of wealth. But going forward, a head start in service exports and expertise in services embedded in manufacturing (think of codes written into a Tesla car) make India well poised to take off once more in a rapidly \u201cservifying\u201d global economy,\u201d he adds.\n\nIndia appears uniquely positioned to specialise in knowledge-based activities \u2014 and services tied to manufacturing \u2014 which generate higher income than more hands-on activities in building and processing.\n\nAt the same time, it is also attracting interest from multinationals seeking to use it as an alternate manufacturing hub to China (Apple is aiming to make 25 per cent of iPhones in India in the coming years.)\n\nWhere does India\u2019s emerging comparative advantage in services come from? It has one of the youngest and largest workforces in the world. For measure, roughly 1mn workers enter its labour market every month. Although this is often cited as one of the nation\u2019s greatest challenges, the country\u2019s surplus of workers also creates enormous opportunities.\n\nMore than one-third of Indian students choose a STEM degree. And given the country\u2019s huge population, that gives it one of the largest pools of graduates \u2014 in areas ranging from digital services, engineering, computing and data sciences \u2014 in the world. When it comes to artificial intelligence, India also has the highest AI skill penetration rate globally, according to LinkedIn data.\n\nThese skillsets are obviously in high demand in the US and Europe, and India has them in abundance. They have the added advantage of not being dependent on location, meaning that multinationals can leverage Indian talent remotely, or by setting up offices and GCCs in the country.\n\nEven then, India has the largest diaspora population in the world. Rising numbers of Indians are moving abroad for education and work, in lucrative industries where there are skill shortages. Indians born outside the US earn an average of $120,000 a year in America, well above the national average. That income returns home, too. Last year, remittance inflows hit a record $125bn \u2014 the largest of any country.\n\nOf course, not everyone entering the workforce is highly skilled. But if more Indians enter higher-income jobs in professional services, this will drive additional service sector roles in India to cater for a growing middle class. (Plus if the country can also soak up some manufacturing activity from China, that can support the employment of individuals with lower skillsets.)\n\nAn under-appreciated facet of most countries is culture. Yes, it may be an amorphous concept, but norms and values do shape nations\u2019 economic destiny, too. (For instance, greater risk tolerance in the US is sometimes cited as a factor that supports its investment and enterprise environment, compared with Europe).\n\nIn India, Jugaad, or frugal innovation, is a way of life. Take Mumbai\u2019s dabbawalas. They shuttle lunch tiffins every day to hundreds of thousands of office workers, navigating chaotic roads with awkwardly stacked and often identical steel containers. Yet a 2010 study from Harvard Business School found only an error rate of just 3.4 mistakes per 1mn transactions.\n\nThe \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude is prevalent across India: from makeshift water pumps cobbled together from truck parts to shoes with floats that help people walk on flooded ground. Last year, the landing of the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the moon was also lauded as a feat of frugal engineering. The operation cost just $74mn (that is less than the budgets of space movies Gravity and Interstellar) \u2014 and the space programme\u2019s $2bn budget is a fraction of that of every other country that has landed on the moon.\n\nEntrepreneurialism is evident in the economy, too. At 271, the country has the third-most billionaires in the world, behind China and the US. Its start-up ecosystem is the third largest globally. And a number of innovative companies have emerged in recent years, including food delivery group Zomato, ecommerce retailer Flipkart and Ola Electric, a two-wheeler electric scooter manufacturer (which last week became India\u2019s largest IPO this year). Of course, Indians head global companies too, for example Sundar Pichai (Google), Satya Nadella (Microsoft) and Laxman Narasimhan (until this week, Starbucks).\n\nThe point? An entrepreneurial spirit has a tangible impact on growth, innovation and investment. It should not be overlooked when assessing any country\u2019s potential. To build on it, India needs to open up to competition, including by easing tariff barriers, and reckoning with large conglomerates with ties to the state.\n\nThat reminds me. Yes, the wedding of Mukesh Ambani\u2019s son was hardly an example of Jugaad. Asia\u2019s richest man and chair of India\u2019s Reliance Industries splashed out \u00a3100mn-\u00a3120mn on the festival, including private gigs by Justin Bieber and Rihanna. Anything but frugal. That aspect of India\u2019s culture is perhaps for another time.\n\nA large, talented and innovative workforce needs capital to leverage its ideas. And, in recent years, both institutional and retail investors have been ploughing cash into Indian companies, lured by the nation\u2019s growth narrative. The National Stock Exchange of India\u2019s market capitalisation has more than doubled since 2020. It is now the fourth-largest by country, having jostled with Hong Kong recently. IPO activity has boomed, too.\n\nReflecting India\u2019s rising promise, MSCI is expected to raise the country\u2019s weight in its benchmark indices, putting it closer to China. That should support further capital flows.\n\nDespite a recent softening in activity in India\u2019s venture capital market, Bain expects rising consumption (India\u2019s internal market is almost double the size in population terms of those of the US and EU), a strong \u201cdigital backbone\u201d and China Plus One tailwinds to support it over the long-term. Indeed, India is currently the second-largest destination for VC and growth funding in Asia-Pacific.\n\nBoosting FDI will be important too. Invest India, the government\u2019s investment promotion agency, has also laid out ambitions to raise India\u2019s annual FDI by about 50 per cent, largely by tapping into China Plus One supply chain strategies.\n\nSo, it seems as though India\u2019s capital markets are maturing and, assuming the economic story remains intact \u2014 and the policy environment supports it (investment in skills, education and infrastructure etc)\u2014 this should drive continued investment and business growth in the country.\n\nOne risk on the horizon, however, is that the huge interest in India has stretched asset valuations. In the coming years, a boost to corporate governance, regulatory oversight, and transparency in its capital markets will go some way towards supporting its financial stability.\n\nFinally, some argue that India\u2019s economic model makes it more resilient compared with other emerging markets, both past and present. Indeed, an economy that can bounce back from shocks helps to drive sustainable growth over the long term:\n\n(i) India\u2019s emerging strength in services makes its growth more robust. Nations that depend on commodities and manufacturing exports can be at the whims of global demand and geopolitical shifts. \u201cThe continuing boost from services exports would make India\u2019s external sector resilient to supply-side shocks over the medium-term, and reduce volatility in the currency,\u201d explains Santanu Sengupta, chief India economist at Goldman Sachs. Services exports accounted for about 44 per cent of India\u2019s overall exports in the last financial year.\n\n(ii) India\u2019s development story is unique insofar as its democratisation largely preceded its economic take-off, as Lamba and Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to the Indian government, noted in a 2020 paper.\n\n\u201cSince 1950 there are only nine countries that have grown for four decades at 4.5 per cent or higher in GDP per capita in real terms without the decadal average falling below 3 per cent,\u201d says Lamba. \u201cIndia is one of them.\u201d\n\nBut the country is also an outlier for being consistently democratic. \u201cSuch high levels of political freedom despite its relatively small [initial] economic footprint arguably slowed but also steadied India\u2019s march towards prosperity\u201d. Lamba explains that democracy has helped India to mediate its many social and cultural cleavages without fundamental ruptures.\n\n(iii) India is also well aligned to benefit from digital and green growth. First, it has developed a world-leading digital infrastructure system, covering universal identity cards, rapid financial transactions and data sharing. Chaiwalas and rickshaw drivers can now collect payments with the swipe of their phones. It has cut red tape, boosted digital enterprises, improved economic inclusion, and supports the government\u2019s ability to target welfare. It also helps future AI adoption across the country.\n\nSecond, although India remains reliant on fossil-fuel power, particularly coal, it has huge potential for renewable energy generation. In 2022, 40 per cent of energy capacity installed came from renewable sources, already making it the world\u2019s third-largest producer. India\u2019s solar power potential in a single year exceeds the possible energy output of all of the fossil fuel energy reserves in the country. BloombergNEF has forecast that India will generate 75 per cent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2050, mostly from wind and solar energy. This suggests the country can play an important role in the global green supply chain.\n\nThe upshot? Clearly a country of India\u2019s scale and diversity cannot be neatly summed up with just a few data points that allude to its rapid economic growth, population size and geopolitical alignments. There is much more below the surface, more than I, at least, had appreciated.\n\nIndia is at once a budding knowledge hub, and a prime choice for manufacturers, looking to diversify from China. A huge workforce, of both highly skilled STEM graduates and labourers, makes that possible. And while money is pouring into its capital markets, creative entrepreneurs are spawning new business ideas too.\n\nThe nation\u2019s many facets guarantee that its development path will be unique. But, the elephant in the \u2014 touted tiger economy\u2019s \u2014 room is that capitalising on it depends on effective governance. Reforms, investment and political stability are all needed. Unlike China\u2019s path, India\u2019s status as a democracy offers hope for long-term sustainable growth.\n\nEven if policymakers get only some of it right, the rewards for India \u2014 and the world \u2014 will perhaps be greater than many had realised.\n\nI joined FT colleagues for a subscriber webinar to discuss the past few weeks of market turmoil, the US Fed and whether we can expect more volatility.\n\nShekhar Aiyar, a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins Sais, reminds readers on the FT\u2019s opinion page that rising disparities in the US and Europe should not overlook the rapid pick-up in incomes in India and China.\n\nCheck out this insightful research piece by economists (Hamza Abdelrahman, Luiz Edgard Oliveira and Adam Shapiro) at the San Francisco Federal Reserve, which tracks the evolution of liquid assets among different income groups in the US.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3824a4b3-ec2a-4297-8e24-2e7c6fe993bf"}}, {"id": "92e4ed25-4c27-4636-99f3-2dc7645cd1c1", "event_name": "India\u2019s Narendra Modi condemns \u2018atrocities\u2019 against women after doctor\u2019s killing", "blurb": "PM also urges neighbouring Bangladesh to ensure safety of minority Hindus after Sheikh Hasina\u2019s ousting", "date": "2024-08-1500:00:00.0", "body": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has condemned violence against women and vowed to mete out \u201ctough punishment\u201d to perpetrators of sexual crimes after the rape and killing of a junior medic shocked Indians and fuelled calls for greater action by the government and police.\n\nModi also urged neighbouring Bangladesh to ensure the safety of minority Hindus, saying Indians were \u201cworried\u201d about their plight, after protesters overthrew the government of his ally Sheikh Hasina last week.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s outrage against the atrocities being committed against our mothers, sisters and daughters,\u201d Modi said,\u00a0speaking to dignitaries and crowds at New Delhi\u2019s Red Fort to mark India\u2019s Independence Day.

Although the drafts were watermarked in an apparent attempt to prevent leaks, copies\u00a0were shared in New Delhi that stirred concerns about its potential chilling effect on free speech and the compliance burden on online creators.\n\nThe ministry said late on Monday that it would provide \u201cfurther additional time\u201d to solicit comments and suggestions until October 15. \u201cWe have brought back the draft to look at suggestions that came in,\u201d a government official, who asked not to be named, told the Financial Times.\n\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party governed for two five-year terms with an outright majority, which allowed it to pass legislation with few\u00a0challenges. But the party lost its majority in this year\u2019s general election.\n\nAnalysts have said that popular commentators and satirists on YouTube and other platforms \u2014 some of whom had as many followers as subscribers to conventional media outlets \u2014 played a role in boosting opposition candidates and stripping the BJP of its majority.\n\n\u201cThis is not the same government with the muscular majority that can pass bills without talking to coalition partners, stakeholders, and opposition parties,\u201d said Apar Gupta, an expert on technology and media law. \u201c[The government\u2019s] legislative agenda is now something which cannot be dictated; it has to be done through trust.\u201d\n\nIndia, with one of the world\u2019s biggest online markets and nearly 1bn internet users, began work on the bill in November before circulating the draft in July, shortly after Modi\u2019s new government was sworn in.\n\nAccording to three\u00a0people who saw copies of the draft, the law was applicable not only to Indians but citizens of other countries, meaning its application could be global. Its remit also covered not just news and entertainment companies, but also individuals who provided news and entertainment as part of their business activity, they said.\n\nMore than 700 online content creators wrote an open letter to Ashwini Vaishnaw, the information and broadcasting minister, this month complaining about \u201copacity in the consultation process\u201d over the bill.\n\nThe Asia Internet Coalition, an industry association whose members include YouTube owner Google and Meta, also wrote to Vaishnaw requesting the opportunity to provide feedback on the bill.\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal of this secretive draft is welcome, but it should not have existed anyway,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, founder and editor of Medianama, a publication focused on technology policy in India.\n\nHe added that the ministry\u2019s statement suggested it had \u201cgone back to the previous draft of November 2023, and will continue to do closed-door consultations\u201d, meaning there was \u201cno plan for a public consultation\u201d.\n\nThis meant the bill could be brought to parliament during its winter session, he said.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ba8fdc6b-bca8-4dce-8a77-db0bd2763b72"}}, {"id": "713c7cfc-edcf-4bd6-a17f-a6222ba29eea", "event_name": "Why Indian billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal reconnected with BT ", "blurb": "UK telco used to own 21% of Bharti\u2019s group.

Mittal on Monday agreed to take the entire holding, valued at \u00a33.2bn at Friday\u2019s closing price, in what is the Indian tycoon\u2019s most significant investment on British soil to date and a historical turnabout.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2001, BT held a 21 per cent stake in Mittal\u2019s New Delhi-based telecoms business \u2014 what has since become the $100bn market cap flagship behemoth Bharti Airtel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a role reversal,\u201d said one Bharti executive after the deal was announced. \u201cIt\u2019s a very large tranche \u2014 if it had been a smaller one we wouldn\u2019t have been interested.\u201d\n\nOn a call with reporters, Mittal emphasised the long-term nature of the investment. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve kept links with the BT management, with every successive CEO in the company [since 2001]\u201d.\n\nHe added that his conglomerate Bharti Enterprises was approached by Altice \u201cin the past couple of weeks\u201d. With the French group attempting to prune back its more than $60bn debt pile, \u201cwe were happy to engage, which we did enthusiastically\u201d, Mittal said.\n\nAlthough analysts say that Mittal\u2019s move was not an obvious one given his conglomerate\u2019s focus on India and Africa, it builds on his foundations in the UK.\n\nBharti Enterprises holds controlling stakes in satellite venture OneWeb and also owns prestigious hotel brands, including The Hoxton and the Gleneagles resort in Scotland, operated by a company founded by his son-in-law. Bharti\u2019s Africa telecoms business is a member of the FTSE 100.\n\nMittal, whose family wealth is estimated at $16.8bn by Forbes, was awarded an honorary knighthood by King Charles III this year for services to UK-India relations. The 66-year-old spends much of his time in London, where two of his children \u2014 his daughter Eiesha and son Shravin, who heads Bharti\u2019s overseas investment arm \u2014 are based.\n\nThe deal also sprang from personal ties. Drahi and Mittal know each other, according to a person familiar with the matter, and multiple executives at BT and Bharti have experience working at both companies. BT\u2019s chief digital and innovation officer Harmeen Mehta was formerly Bharti Airtel\u2019s global chief information officer and head of its cloud and security business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sector he understands, it\u2019s a company they understand and they\u2019ve already got global reach outside of India,\u201d said another person with knowledge of the founder\u2019s thinking. \u201cThere\u2019s long-standing familiarities that also reinforced his confidence in what this company can be.\u201d\n\nMittal\u2019s purchase also plays into the wider trend of heightened Indian corporate interest in the UK. India is the country\u2019s second-largest source of foreign direct investment: there are more than 950 companies with combined revenue of about $65bn operating in Britain \u2014 up from 900 in 2022, according to the UK India Business Council.\n\nThose investments are playing out as both New Delhi and the new Labour government in London attempt to revive free trade talks. UK foreign secretary David Lammy visited India last month to restart discussions that were suspended due to elections in both nations.\n\nIndia\u2019s government is looking to secure wider market access for its goods, including textiles, as well as an easing of restrictions on Indians working and studying in the UK.\n\nPiyush Goyal, India\u2019s commerce minister who is leading the trade talks, in a post on social media platform X, called Bharti\u2019s BT acquisition a \u201ctestimony to the growing strength of India\u201d.\n\nMittal has deftly managed previous British purchases, including a 2021 deal to become the biggest shareholder in OneWeb ahead of the UK government following a joint effort to rescue the space-internet pioneer from bankruptcy.\n\nWith BT, he will buy 10 per cent of Altice\u2019s holding immediately, with the rest to be purchased after regulatory approvals, including voluntary UK security clearance.\n\n\u201cWe have not asked for any board seat, we have not even applied our mind to that,\u201d said Mittal, who ruled out taking a controlling holding in BT. \u201cAt the moment, our focus was just to pick up the stake. We are having no conditions attached to that.\u201d\n\nFor BT\u2019s chief executive Allison Kirkby, who has pledged to cut \u00a33bn of costs and increase its dividend, Mittal\u2019s purchase \u201coffered a strong validation\u201d of her six-month old leadership at BT, said Paolo Pescatore, founder and TMT analyst at PP Foresight.\n\nHe described the deal as \u201cseeming like a bolt out of the blue\u201d, comparing Mittal\u2019s decision to take such a large stake with other investors that have instead steadily brought and increased their holdings in European telcos.\n\nMittal\u2019s move will leave the UK telecoms group with a \u201cmuch more stable shareholder\u201d, according to a person familiar with BT\u2019s thinking. \u201cIt removes at a stroke [the risk of] a severely forced sale in the market of a large stake.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, BT\u2019s shares closed up 8.4 per cent up at 141.5p. Mittal said UK and European telecom companies were \u201cpoorly valued\u201d and that BT\u2019s strategy under Kirkby has been \u201cnothing but outstanding\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think the investor community will over a period of time start to recognise the wonderful job that is being done,\u201d the tycoon added.\n\nKaren Egan, head of telecoms at Enders Analysis, agreed that BT \u201cis undervalued\u201d. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s had a good run of late but there\u2019s more to go. When you look at it on a 2-3 year view when the cash flow recovery story is delivered on, it will look incredibly cheap.\u201d\n\nA first-generation entrepreneur born in the state of Punjab, Mittal started out in business in 1976 making bicycle parts, initially borrowing $1,500 from his father \u2014 a politician and former member of parliament in the country\u2019s upper house.\n\nMittal branched out into making telephones and in 1992 bid for a licence in order to launch one of India\u2019s first mobile phone companies as the country began to liberalise its economy.\n\nThree years later he founded his telecoms group, which has grown to become India\u2019s second-largest with more than 400mn subscribers in its home market and a wide network across Africa. Domestically, Bharti Airtel is second only to rival Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Jio, which entered and upended the industry in 2016 with a fierce price war.\n\nMittal is a lower-key figure than Ambani, Asia\u2019s richest man. The Ambanis made headlines with an extravagant months-long celebration of the marriage of their youngest child Anant, estimated to have cost hundreds of millions of dollars this year. They are also fronting India\u2019s efforts to host the 2036 Olympic summer games.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of clout\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but the Mittals don\u2019t crave that much attention compared to some of the other corporate groups,\u201d said a Mumbai-based analyst whose company has advised Bharti Airtel on past transactions. \u201cThey prefer to remain private and as a group they seem to be more focused on professionalising their operations than some of these other entities.\u201d\n\nWhile Bharti has various business interests, such as its Indian partnership with Del Monte, it is mainly seen as a telecoms company, in contrast to Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries, which cuts across a broader swath of industries, including retail and oil refining. The Ambani family also owns British trophy assets, including toy chain Hamleys, as well as country club Stoke Park.\n\nMittal and Ambani\u2019s Jio network operate a near duopoly in India with the now state-owned Vodafone Idea lagging behind. The two industrialists have spent billions of dollars helping India realise \u201cone of the quickest 5G rollouts globally\u201d, according to Axis Capital in Mumbai.\n\n\u201c[BT] won\u2019t be the last deal,\u201d the Bharti executive said about the conglomerate\u2019s ambitions.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4876e0fb-18d7-40e9-8224-9d81b2928efa"}}, {"id": "ef564fed-2d76-446b-ac97-134ab4efe21a", "event_name": "Global inequality is narrowing \u2014 and that is cause for celebration", "blurb": "Westerners worried about growing disparities at home shouldn\u2019t overlook the transformative effect of liberalisation in India and China", "date": "2024-08-1200:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is a Visiting Scholar at Johns Hopkins SAIS, a Non-Resident Fellow at Bruegel and a Visiting Professor at NCAER. He is currently writing a book entitled \u2018A Defence of the Liberal Economic Order\u2019\n\nImagine that across the length and breadth of America, working-class wages grew much faster than the incomes of millionaires. Rustbelt states started catching up with their more prosperous coastal counterparts. But these developments came with a caveat: greater income inequality in Beverly Hills. The pay cheque gap between Leonardo DiCaprio and his supporting cast increased. Superhero sequels crushed indie movies at the box office.\n\nTaken as a whole, these developments would be cause for joyous celebration. Few would shed a tear for the Golden Globe nominees falling further behind their Oscar-winning colleagues.\n\nSomething analogous to this happy fiction has been happening at a worldwide level over roughly the past half century. While the public discourse focuses overwhelmingly on rising domestic inequality in western countries, global inequality has fallen sharply, primarily due to the rise of two Asian giants, China and India. In 1980, the two countries accounted for almost 40 per cent of the world population but only 5 per cent of world income. Today they still make up roughly the same share of global population, but account for a much larger 25 per cent of global income. The global income distribution remains unequal, but not nearly as unequal as it used to be.\n\nSince they started liberalising their economies in the late 20th century, both China and India have been utterly transformed from the plodding and insular economies they used to be. In neither country was liberalisation a once-and-for-all event; reforms gathered speed at times and subsided or even went into reverse at others. Nonetheless, the overall trajectory has been unmistakable.\n\nBoth countries registered a step-increase in GDP growth post liberalisation compared with previous decades. More important, the new economic dynamism lifted all boats. Although both countries saw an increase in inequality after liberalising, there was nonetheless rapid income growth even at the bottom of the income distribution. The steep fall in the number of people living in absolute poverty in China and India must count as one of the most dramatic improvements in human welfare in the history of the world. Together, the two countries were responsible for lifting an astonishing 1.1bn people above the international poverty line over the past four decades.\n\nOver the same period, income inequality rose sharply in the west, so much so that it now dominates the political discourse and is one of the chief culprits behind a resurgent populism on both sides of the Atlantic. In most OECD countries the labour share of income has declined substantially in recent decades, with the gains from economic growth accruing disproportionately to the owners of capital and the highly educated. A vivid illustration is provided by the US, where GDP per capita has more than doubled since the mid-1980s, but median household income has risen by only about 30 per cent.\n\nThese numbers are disturbing and politically consequential. They have fuelled populist attacks on what might be called the liberal economic order: a system of free(ish) trade and cross-border investment, substantial immigration from poor to rich countries, and a rules-based international order adjudicated by institutions such as the World Trade Organization.\n\nBut they need to be put in perspective. The US and western Europe collectively comprise about 11 per cent of the global population. Their deteriorating domestic income distributions must be set against the gains made by much vaster numbers of much poorer people. The economist Branko Milanovic has pointed out that the Theil index \u2014 a standard measure of global income inequality \u2014 has shown considerable improvement since the 1980s, with widening within-country inequality more than outweighed by narrowing between-country inequality.\n\nHow should a universalist \u2014 somebody who holds that human life has equal worth irrespective of location \u2014 regard the overall trajectory of the past half century?\n\nThe philosopher John Rawls suggested that questions about the just ordering of society should be considered from behind a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d. If you knew nothing about your own attributes \u2014 whether you were rich or poor, male or female, Chinese or American \u2014 which society would you choose to inhabit: today\u2019s world, or the world of 50 years ago? Given that your chances of being Chinese or Indian are roughly two-fifths, while your chances of being a westerner are about one-tenth, you would almost certainly choose the present.

It did not intend to make an offer for the whole of BT, Bharti added.\n\nThe investment raises the profile of the 66-year-old billionaire who amassed his fortune in India\u2019s telecoms market. Bharti Airtel, the largest part of his empire, emerged as India\u2019s second-largest operator following a brutal price war instigated by billionaire Mukesh Ambani in 2016 that felled several rivals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching BT for long, long years, it\u2019s a company which has a glorious past, has national status, has this tremendous amount of physical infrastructure in the UK,\u201d Mittal said on a call with reporters on Monday.\n\n\u201cSo I hope that I can add some value to their thinking\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we are long term, this is not a stock market operation and we are not in this for making a buck.\u201d\n\nBharti said that it supported BT chief executive Allison Kirkby, who started in February and has presided over an almost 30 per cent gain in the group\u2019s shares thanks to a combination of cost cuts, a higher dividend and improving cash flow. Altice\u2019s entire stake in BT was worth about \u00a33.2bn at Friday\u2019s closing price.\n\nDespite the recent rally in BT shares, including an almost 8 per cent jump on Monday, the investment in the former UK telecoms monopoly has proved lossmaking for Altice, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAltice first took a stake in BT in 2021, acquiring a 12 per cent holding that it later increased to 24.5 per cent. Altice borrowed heavily from banks to build its holding in BT, which has dropped about \u00a31bn in value since it was disclosed, according to FT calculations.\n\nA portion of the stake was financed using derivatives that should have protected Drahi\u2019s investment vehicle\u00a0from some of these losses and Altice has also received dividends as a BT shareholder.\n\nAltice declined to comment on the drop in the value of its BT stake.\n\nDrahi faces pressure to sell assets to reduce a more than $60bn debt pile amassed during the era of cheap money.\n\nIn March, it sold a news channel and a radio station to shipping magnate Rodolphe Saad\u00e9. Last week, Drahi partnered with Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund ADQ to give a $1bn capital injection to auction house Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nKaren Egan, head of telecoms at Enders Analysis, described Mittal as a \u201ccompletely different kettle of fish to Patrick Drahi\u201d.\n\n\u201c[Mittal] is not short term. He\u2019ll be completely constructive and collaborative with BT, he really understands the holistic approach of telecoms,\u201d she said.\n\nThe ties between Mittal and BT date back to the late 1990s, when the UK company owned a 21 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel and had two board seats.\n\nMittal is the second high-profile shareholder BT has gained this year, after it was disclosed in June that Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim had taken a 3 per cent stake.\n\nKirkby said on Monday: \u201cWe welcome investors who recognise the long-term value of our business, and this scale of investment from Bharti Global is a great vote of confidence in the future of BT Group and our strategy.\u201d\n\nBharti Airtel\u2019s Mumbai-listed shares fell 0.4 per cent on Monday, but have advanced 43 per cent this year, beating the 10 per cent gain in India\u2019s benchmark BSE Sensex index.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/1b2d4195-8af4-439b-86c5-cc0f2f1f78f5"}}, {"id": "e143e7b1-6ecb-4771-8cca-31c9373ab5bd", "event_name": "UN credibility depends on adjusting veto rights to match shift in global power", "blurb": "Imagine the poetic justice if the UK were to cede its UNSC seat in favour of India", "date": "2024-08-1100:00:00.0", "body": "The writer, a distinguished fellow at the National University of Singapore, is the author of \u2018The Asian 21st Century\u2019\n\nFifteen years have passed since Martin Wolf wrote, \u201cWithin a decade a world in which the UK is on the United Nations Security Council and India is not will seem beyond laughable.\u201d The laughable situation continues.\n\nThe founding fathers of the UN were wise in incentivising the great powers of the day to stay in the organisation by giving them privileged positions as permanent veto-wielding members. However, they were unwise in not instituting a mechanism for substituting yesterday\u2019s great powers with tomorrow\u2019s great powers.\n\nIn 1945, the UK was a great global power with colonies around the world, including India. As recently as 1980, the UK\u2019s GDP was three times the size of India\u2019s, at $564bn to $186bn. By 2045, when the UN celebrates its 100th anniversary, Goldman Sachs projects that India\u2019s GDP will be around $18tn \u2014 nearly four times as big as the UK\u2019s projected $5tn. It would then be truly untenable for Britain to be a veto-wielding member while India is not.\n\nThe UN will lose all credibility if this situation persists. More dangerously, India would be strong enough to announce that it will not abide by UNSC decisions if it\u2019s not a permanent member of the council.\n\nThere\u2019s an obvious, although, for the moment unlikely, solution to this: the UK should cede its seat to India \u2014 subject, of course, to the politics and mechanics of the council. In theory, the UK would be giving up a lot by doing so. Yet, in practice, nothing would change as it has already in effect relinquished its veto. British leaders have long known that if the UK were to exercise its veto alone, there would be global outrage \u2014 which is why they have not exercised a solitary veto since 1972. Indeed, they have not cast a veto at all since 1989.\n\nEven more sadly, the British have ceased to take any independent positions in the UNSC. Even when they were uncomfortable with US positions in the council, they never expressed dissent. For instance, during the build-up to the Iraq war in 2003, they felt obliged to go along with the American position even though France and Germany fiercely opposed it (and rightly so).\n\nBy leaving the Security Council, the UK would liberate itself from the compulsion to support the US position regardless of its merits. Indeed, it could become a better friend by giving frank advice to a country that has yet to accept that the world has changed fundamentally. The unipolar world is over; a new multipolar world is emerging. British sagacity can help the Americans transition to this different world.\n\nThis massive shift in global power represents the strongest reason for injecting India immediately and permanently into the UNSC. The country is uniquely able to straddle the eastern and western worlds: it can work with the US in the Quad (which includes Australia and Japan), and with China and Russia in the larger Brics group.\n\nImportantly, it would be able to represent the views of the majority of the world\u2019s population as power shifts from the G7 to the global south. India understands the needs and aspirations of the global south in a way that few nations can. This explains how it successfully engineered G20 membership for the African Union.\n\nThere would also be poetic justice in the UK ceding its UNSC seat in favour of India. While many in the UK believe that the era of the British Raj was a benevolent one for Indians, the opposite is true. As Shashi Tharoor eloquently said, \u201cBritain\u2019s rise for 200 years was financed by its depredations in India. In fact, Britain\u2019s industrial revolution was actually premised upon the de-industrialisation of India\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[In this period] between 15-29 million Indians died of starvation in British induced famines.\u201d\n\nThe UK is still unable to return the Koh-i-noor diamond to India, even though it was looted by British imperialists who took it away from a 10-year-old ruler after imprisoning his mother. But perhaps it could offer India something even more valuable: a permanent seat in the UNSC.\n\nSir Keir Starmer\u2019s government will need some time to settle in before it can even contemplate such a radical move. There would be fierce resistance from the British establishment to giving up a perk from the past, just as the feudal lords resisted the transition to more democratic political arrangements.\n\nYet, as 2027 will mark the 80th anniversary of India\u2019s liberation from British rule, it would be the perfect year for the UK to make this great gift to India. It would finally close the chapter on British colonial rule of India and help to cement another hundred years of friendship between the UK and India. At the same time, we will have a UNSC that represents the great powers of today, not the great powers of yesterday.\n\nLetters in response to this article:\n\nUN security council veto arrangement works well\u00a0/\u00a0From Syed Sharfuddin, Former Pakistan Diplomat; Special Adviser, Commonwealth Secretariat (2000 to 2006), London SW20, UKA proposal that gives the global south democratic leadership / From Ayca Ariyoruk, West New York, NJ, USP5 plus the Vatican \u2014 now that would be real reform / From Miche\u00e1l O\u2019Cathail, D\u00fan Laoghaire, County Dublin, Ireland\n\nIndia\u2019s claim to Koh-i-noor\u00a0/\u00a0From Gon\u00e7alo Cabral, Macau\n\nWhy India is not ready for a seat on security council / From Professor Max Hilaire, Owings Mills, MD, US", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/abf9a9bb-c88c-4faa-9a86-6ec500bcd5db"}}, {"id": "17d786b5-fc7e-48a6-96a9-ef5cc5a6ca75", "event_name": "Chair of Indian regulator invested in funds linked to Adani, alleges Hindenburg Research", "blurb": "Madhabi Buch and her husband deny claims she is biased and say their finances are an \u2018open book\u2019", "date": "2024-08-1100:00:00.0", "body": "The chair of India\u2019s capital markets regulator held stakes in an offshore fund structure used by Vinod Adani, holding the agency back in investigating fraud charges against the powerful eponymous conglomerate run by his billionaire brother, according to fresh allegations levelled by US short seller Hindenburg Research.\n\nMadhabi Buch, head of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and her husband had \u201chidden\u201d holdings in Bermuda and Mauritius entities also drawn upon by the older brother of Adani Group founder Gautam Adani, Hindenburg Research said in a post late on Saturday, citing leaked documents in its possession.\n\nIn a statement, the couple said that they \u201cstrongly deny the baseless allegations and insinuations made in the report\u201d.\n\nThe latest allegations were made 18 months after Hindenburg first accused Adani\u2019s infrastructure-focused empire of corporate fraud and detailed a web of offshore funds it said were used to evade minimum shareholder listing rules. At the time, it prompted a meltdown across the conglomerate\u2019s listed companies and erased $140bn in market value.\n\nSebi has yet to make public findings from multiple long-running probes into the Adani Group after India\u2019s Supreme Court in January ordered it to wind up the investigations within three months.

Anuj Dua, head of Royal Enfield\u2019s Asia-Pacific business, said its electric bike was in the \u201cadvanced development\u201d stage.\n\nIn Japan, Yamaha Motor has set an ambitious target to make 90 per cent of its motorcycle sales electric by 2050, but the group has been forced to push back its previous goal of selling 10 electric models by the end of this year to mid-2025.

After weeks of escalating protests and violence, Sheikh Hasina on Monday fled to India as anti-government demonstrators marched on her official residence.\n\nThe sudden collapse of her government after 15 years has left a precarious power vacuum in Bangladesh, a country of 170mn that India considers its most dependable regional partner.\n\nIt has also set back New Delhi\u2019s regional strategy at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to counter growing Chinese influence.

The politically well-connected Adani infrastructure conglomerate is among the Indian businesses that secured lucrative power supply deals in Bangladesh.\n\n\u201cHasina was pro-India and was open to transforming the relationship,\u201d C Raja Mohan, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Delhi, said. \u201cThe strategic question is: can we create structural relationships which will survive regime changes?\u201d\n\nSheikh Hasina was the first leader to visit Modi after his re-election in June despite growing anger at home towards her authoritarianism and poor human rights record.\n\nIndia did not join powers including the US and UK in criticising a crackdown on the opposition BNP ahead of Sheikh Hasina\u2019s re-election in January, and some Bangladeshi civil society activists accused\u00a0New Delhi of using its clout to shield her regime.\n\n\u201cOver the last couple of years, India should have read the tea leaves better,\u201d said Kanti Bajpai, an Indian foreign policy scholar. \u201cThe Indian government could have begun to step away from such a close relationship\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009This is now a problem.\u201d\n\nSheikh Hasina\u2019s downfall follows another diplomatic setback for India in the Maldives, which in November elected President Mohamed Muizzu on an \u201cIndia Out\u201d platform and went on to expel a small contingent of Indian troops.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan, India is vying with China for influence.\n\nOne of India\u2019s immediate challenges is what to do with Sheikh Hasina. Jaishankar confirmed that she had arrived near Delhi on Monday \u201cat very short notice\u201d.\n\nIn providing her with safe passage shortly before protesters stormed her Dhaka residence, India helped shield her from potential violence and prevent further chaos in Bangladesh.\n\nBut her continued presence risks reinforcing New Delhi\u2019s image as a friend of the 76-year-old former prime minister and could complicate relations with Bangladesh\u2019s next government, analysts said.\n\nSheikh Hasina is seeking asylum in a third country, but her son Sajeeb Wazed told broadcasters she had not decided where to go and was \u201cgoing to stay in Delhi for a little while\u201d. Jaishankar reportedly told Indian party leaders that she was in a \u201cstate of shock\u201d.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s newly appointed interim leader Muhammad Yunus, a celebrated economist and Nobel laureate, said he would work to restore stability and create \u201ca road map to new elections\u201d.\n\nNew polls in Bangladesh could allow the BNP to make a comeback, and the party has tried to shake off its reputation as a historic antagonist of India.\n\n\u201cThe BNP is always looking to India as an important regional development partner,\u201d said Tabith Awal, a BNP executive committee member. \u201cWe just hope the Indian government will stop depending on only one person, which was Sheikh Hasina, and work directly with the people of Bangladesh.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said that whoever comes to power in Bangladesh would likely have little choice but to lean on its larger neighbour.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of angst in New Delhi right now about what shape the government will take,\u201d said Shafqat Munir, senior fellow with the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. \u201cBut geopolitics and geographic realities dictate that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it will be very important to work with India.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6961f171-d433-4fab-90c9-8fca790547d6"}}, {"id": "aa2edfbc-a743-4da2-a132-2180729b21ae", "event_name": "India\u2019s central bank warns lenders not to add to bets against rupee", "blurb": "Request comes after global market turmoil pushes currency to record low against the dollar", "date": "2024-08-0700:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s central bank has called on the country\u2019s lenders not to add to existing bets against the rupee as it seeks to prop up a currency that has recently hit record lows.\n\nOfficials from the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday contacted some of the country\u2019s largest banks with the aim of easing pressure on the rupee, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe currency has fallen to a series of new lows against the US dollar over the past month \u2014 making it one of the worst performers in Asia \u2014 despite regular market interventions by the RBI designed to stem the decline and bolster investor confidence in the world\u2019s fastest growing large economy.\n\n\u201cThey are trying everything,\u201d said a currency strategist at a major Indian brokerage.\n\nOne Mumbai-based banker said the central bank has over the past few years quietly moved from a \u201cmanaged float\u201d currency strategy \u2014 where the rupee is allowed to fluctuate within a certain range \u2014 to a \u201ccreeping peg\u201d where the exchange rate is allowed to move gradually over time.

Its recent weakness has been attributed to outflows from local stocks, the unwinding of carry trades, a recent increase in equity taxes, and demand for dollars from the country\u2019s importers.\n\nIndia\u2019s currency has continued to hit \u201cfresh record lows amid persistent equity outflows\u201d, said Aditi Gupta, economist at Bank of Baroda. \u201cRBI is likely to keep a steady watch on the market developments.\u201d\n\nIndia was also hit this week by volatility across global markets, which followed last week\u2019s Bank of Japan rate rise and concerns about a potential US recession, although its equity markets have since rebounded.\n\nThe RBI was \u201cconcerned with any sudden and sharp moves\u201d, said one Indian banker. \u201cMarket turmoil earlier this week in Japan and the US maybe prompting this.\u201d\n\nThe central bank said it was unaware of any instructions issued to India\u2019s lenders, which were first reported by Reuters.\n\nThe RBI, which most economists expect to keep its key interest rate on hold at 6.5 per cent on Thursday, has been building up India\u2019s foreign-exchange reserves, which have risen 7.6 per cent this year to $667bn.\n\nIn April, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said: \u201cIt has always been the priority of the Reserve Bank to ensure stability of the Indian rupee.\u201d The reserve accretion \u201cacts as a buffer against future risks, especially in a situation when the cycle turns\u201d, he added.\n\nBarclays analysts last month said they do not expect any major changes in the RBI\u2019s intervention strategy even after Das\u2019s term finishes at the end of this year.

She has been beamed to audiences at home via television adverts and has deployed US public relations company Teneo to promote her image internationally.\n\nHer high-profile push comes only weeks after the lavish wedding she hosted for her son Anant in Mumbai that attracted international attention and was attended by global celebrities, including Kim Kardashian.\n\nAmbani\u2019s goals in Paris include lobbying for India \u2014 which has historically underperformed at the Olympics, considering its 1.4bn-strong population \u2014 to host the 2036 summer games. \u201cIndia has arrived,\u201d she told a crowd at the India House opening ceremony last month. \u201cIt is time that the flame, which was first lit in Athens, lights up in our ancient land.\u201d\n\nThe campaign is already helping the family extend its influence and position its conglomerate, oil-to-telecoms group Reliance Industries, as a prime beneficiary of the growth of India\u2019s lucrative sports sector.\n\nIndian companies, from Adani Group to steelmaker JSW, have all sought to capitalise on their sponsorship of the country\u2019s Olympians. But Reliance has in recent years amassed a vast portfolio of sports businesses in a quest to dominate the industry.\n\nThey include Indian Premier League cricket team the Mumbai Indians and a stake in India\u2019s top-tier football league. Reliance\u2019s media network Viacom18 holds lucrative sporting rights, including to broadcast this year\u2019s Games.\n\nMany Indians welcome corporate investment as an opportunity to improve the country\u2019s disappointing Olympic record \u2014 a consequence partly of its poorly funded, politicised sports associations, analysts say. With 35 medals, India is behind much smaller countries such as Estonia and Uzbekistan in the all-time rankings.\n\nAsked on Wednesday morning how the IOC viewed India\u2019s current enthusiasm for the Olympics, Anne-Sophie Vourmard, managing director of the committee\u2019s television and marketing services, said: \u201cFor us, it is certainly a country that we believe\u00a0has a lot of potential,\u00a0including commercially. We would love to welcome a new top sponsor\u00a0from India, and I\u2019m sure that will happen very, very soon.\u201d\n\nIndian athletes have had a tough outing in Paris so far, collecting only three bronze medals, all for shooting. Neeraj Chopra, a Tokyo Games gold medallist in the javelin and one of India\u2019s biggest sports stars, will defend his crown in the men\u2019s contest on Thursday after qualifying on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe have progressed, but there\u2019s still a long way to go,\u201d said Abhinav Bindra, who became India\u2019s first Olympic gold medallist in an individual sport when he won an air rifle event in 2008. \u201cThere is corporate interest, not just from Reliance. We need to see more of that.\u201d\n\nReliance\u2019s vast commercial sporting empire also leaves the family well placed to benefit were India to host the Olympics, say analysts.\n\nNita\u2019s Paris push underscores the way so-called \u201cBollygarch\u201d tycoons are increasingly influencing public life in India \u2014 a trend critics say often blurs the line between national good and private interest, and that has sparked unease among observers at home.\n\n\u201cIndian sports need money from wherever they can get it, and if tycoons take an interest, I think most sportspeople will welcome that,\u201d said Santosh Desai, a prominent Indian columnist and advertising executive.\n\nBut, he added: \u201cIs the involvement of\u2009tycoons in more and more public arenas dangerous? I think yes. It hands over more of our lives to business interests and, whatever their altruistic motives, at the heart of it undeniably lie private interests.\u201d\n\nConsternation in India about the power of big business featured prominently in the country\u2019s June election. Anger over widening inequality under Narendra Modi\u2019s government contributed to the prime minister\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party losing its parliamentary majority, with the opposition attacking Modi\u2019s ties to wealthy business figures such as the Ambanis.\n\nTo critics, nothing symbolised the gulf between rich and poor more than Anant Ambani\u2019s extravagant wedding festivities, which overlapped with the election campaign and are thought to have cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nRepresentatives for Nita and Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Ambanis have portrayed themselves as nation builders working to leave a cultural legacy, in the mould of American families such as the Carnegies or Guggenheims. Mukesh, who Forbes ranks as the richest man in Asia with a $113bn fortune, runs the company\u2019s core businesses while Nita heads its sporting and cultural activities.\n\nLast year, they inaugurated the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre in Mumbai, a vast venue hosting plays and exhibitions. Reliance Foundation, which Nita chairs, has pumped money into grassroots sports and the group runs multiple athletics academies, with more planned. Nita became a member of the IOC in 2016.\n\nA large screen at India House encourages visitors to \u201cmake a wish\u201d for India to host the Olympics. The Ambanis \u201chave gotten to the stage where they believe India has a greater destiny and someone has to get them there\u201d, said one person close to the family.\n\nQualms about the role of business in public life have not registered in India\u2019s largely corporate-owned mainstream media, with outlets such as The Economic Times newspaper saying Nita was \u201cmaking India proud\u201d.\n\nSharda Ugra, a sports writer based in Bengaluru in southern India, said private investment was helping to fill \u201ca massive gap in sporting infrastructure\u201d.\n\nHowever, she cautioned, the growing \u201cAmbanification\u201d of Indian sports concentrated too much power in the hands of one family.\n\n\u201cWho is going to criticise them if they own the team, they own the league [and] they own the TV channel?\u201d she said. \u201cThe ownership of everything takes away accountability.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/4aa4e7f8-6796-414b-bb2b-4040ea75d764"}}, {"id": "f4e2989c-7996-4110-9bd0-5dddc2da163e", "event_name": "Can India\u2019s economy thrive without China\u2019s help?", "blurb": "The country\u2019s restrictions on technology and people from its rival risk stifling its ambitions to become a manufacturing superpower ", "date": "2024-08-0700:00:00.0", "body": "At a testing facility near the town of Cheyyar in India\u2019s southern Tamil Nadu state, a new generation of Mahindra Group vehicles are being put through their paces.\n\nThe carmaker\u2019s latest flagship sport utility vehicles whizz around a high-speed racetrack with sheer banking slopes, muddy off-road courses, and potholed lanes designed to simulate Indian roads. At the company\u2019s nearby research centre, electric vehicle prototypes due to be released early next year are being fine tuned and equipped with the latest digital technology.\n\nMahindra\u2019s futuristic fleet attests not only to a rising automotive sector in India, but to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan, or \u201cSelf-reliant India\u201d, campaign.\n\nEVs are one of the industrial sectors, alongside advanced batteries and microchips, to which the Modi government has devoted billions of dollars of \u201cproduction-linked incentives\u201d or PLIs \u2014 sweeteners for companies that pledge to \u201cMake in India\u201d, in the words of one of the leader\u2019s top slogans.\n\nAfter missing out on the export-led growth spurt that lifted China\u2019s economy over the past three decades, India is determined to catch up with its neighbour and rival \u2014 but strictly on its own terms. That has translated to some of the harshest restrictions on Chinese inward investment of any major world economy.\n\nSince 2020, companies with Chinese shareholders have needed to apply for permission from New Delhi to invest in India \u2014 and this has rarely been granted. BYD, the Chinese EV behemoth that increasingly dominates world markets, is among the companies the Modi government has refused permission to build a factory.\n\nAt the same time, India has outlawed dozens of Chinese apps, while launching a tax and legal crackdown on Chinese mobile phone producers. Indian officials boast of being the world\u2019s first country to have banned the China-owned social media app TikTok. India has also cut back visas for Chinese nationals, making it one of Asia\u2019s few countries where they are a rare sight.\n\nThese moves come against the backdrop of a long-standing Indian penchant for protectionism, a toxic border dispute with China in the Himalayas, and mounting paranoia over the security risks of allowing Beijing a free hand in its consumer markets, companies, and high tech.\n\nBut some critics are warning that India\u2019s tough line on China could starve it of the capital, components and knowhow needed to realise its ambition of becoming a major manufacturing power.\n\nEven as the Modi government strives to restrict the flow of Chinese investment and visitors, Indian companies remain heavily dependent on Chinese imports. Mahindra\u2019s EVs \u2014 for all their localised ingenuity \u2014 use battery cells made by BYD and imported from China.\n\nChinese goods dominate other industries too, from solar panels to the active pharmaceutical ingredients that go into drugs. In the latest financial year, India\u2019s imports from China hit a record $101.7bn, a 66 per cent rise since the same period seven years ago. China has now supplanted the US as the country\u2019s top trading partner.\n\n\u201cThe shrill rhetoric against China has created a situation where there is an incongruence between political messaging and economic requirements, and this contradiction is placing New Delhi under stress,\u201d says Sushant Singh, lecturer in South Asian studies at Yale University. \u201cEventually, India cannot do without close economic ties with Beijing.\u201d\n\nA backlash is forming in the business community. Some argue the Modi administration\u2019s Sinophobia is working at cross purposes with its industrial ambitions in sectors such as consumer electronics. They say tough rules are keeping out suppliers and technicians serving companies like Apple, who have faced long delays in obtaining visas.\n\nTop conglomerates from Adani Group to Tata Sons are among those pushing for visa access for Chinese workers needed to install machinery or design plants. \u201cThis [industry] never existed in India, so the expertise has to come from somewhere,\u201d says one executive.\n\nAnand Mahindra, the billionaire chair of the eponymous conglomerate, acknowledges it is \u201cnot going to be easy\u201d for India to go it alone. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an enormous pull for India, an enormous call for India to move much more swiftly on trying to become a substitute for China,\u201d he tells the Financial Times.\n\nInside India\u2019s government, a debate is under way about whether or not the restrictions are an own goal for a country that aspires to build an export-driven manufacturing sector to rival other Asian powerhouses. Officials privately acknowledge that to become a credible \u201cChina plus one\u201d manufacturing destination, India \u2014 paradoxically \u2014 needs key inputs from China.\n\nThe government\u2019s annual economic survey released in July argued it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that India would have to plug itself into China\u2019s supply chains to meet that aim.\n\nBut even amid a growing corporate clamour to loosen the restrictions on Chinese capital, anti-China sentiment remains high in New Delhi, which has refused to reset relations with Beijing until normality is restored at their frontier.\n\nAs India\u2019s foreign secretary S Jaishankar asked a corporate audience in May, \u201cwould you do business with someone who has barged into your turf?\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s rethink of its relationship with China dates back to 2020, when its economic and security circumstances altered dramatically.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic was then laying bare India\u2019s reliance on China for about 70 per cent of its bulk drugs \u2014 such as paracetamol \u2014 and ingredients, after shortfalls from its neighbour caused a drop in medicine supplies.\n\nAt around the same time, bilateral relations deteriorated after Indian and Chinese troops clashed on the disputed border in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, killing at least 24.\n\nEven before the Ladakh skirmishes, New Delhi had sought to \u201ccurb opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies\u201d due to the pandemic. In a measure dubbed Press Note 3, India made all investments by \u201cland border-sharing countries\u201d subject to government approval and introduced a bureaucratic process that Indian policymakers themselves privately acknowledge is opaque.\n\nWhile the measure made explicit reference only to Bangladesh and India\u2019s arch-enemy Pakistan, it was widely understood as primarily a defence against China. \u201cChina\u2019s Covid-era actions and the border crisis have been an inflection point in how Delhi saw economic ties with China,\u201d says Tanvi Madan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe goal hasn\u2019t been decoupling but de-risking, with the idea being to identify and reduce or mitigate India\u2019s vulnerabilities, particularly in critical sectors and build a more resilient economy.\u201d\n\nYet officials acknowledge the moves are not only about Indian weaknesses but also Chinese strengths. \u201cChina is not a market economy and yet the world has given it the benefits of a market economy,\u201d one senior Indian official told the FT last year. \u201cThey have flooded our markets with their goods.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s soaring import bill is indeed in part due to Chinese dumping as its economy slows, says Nandita Rajhansa, economist at Marcellus Investment Managers in Mumbai. \u201cThey have a lot of capacity, but no one to consume within the country,\u201d she says. Indian companies should \u201ctake that as an opportunity, get raw materials really cheap\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009then obviously they gain benefits from scale\u201d.\n\nNew Delhi\u2019s hawkishness seems prescient at a time when the EU, US and others are also taking measures to build resilience against China in areas such as chips and EVs. But inside the Indian establishment, doubts are increasingly being voiced about the wisdom of the government\u2019s anti-China stance.\n\n\u201cThere is a general discussion going on whether Press Note 3 should be done away with, whether it\u2019s harming the setting up of manufacturing here,\u201d one government bureaucrat says. \u201cIf you want Apple here and you don\u2019t get suppliers here, value addition will always be low.\u201d\n\nIn June the electronics industry complained about a backlog of thousands of visas for Chinese engineers and technicians. Pankaj Mohindroo, chair of the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association, told the FT that the bottleneck was hitting not only Chinese companies, but American, British, Taiwanese, Japanese and domestic firms that are building capabilities in India and need Chinese experts to set up or run their lines.\n\nAccording to three government officials, Luxshare, the Chinese manufacturer that supplies Apple, was thwarted by Press Note 3 in its attempt to expand its operations in India, and instead shifted its planned investment to Vietnam. In a partial course correction, Modi\u2019s government has in recent months fast-tracked the provision of visas for Chinese citizens whose work falls under the rubric of India\u2019s PLIs.\n\nAccording to a second government official, there is a split within the establishment. The ministries of foreign and home affairs support a more hawkish stance, while economic technocrats argue for more flexibility.\n\n\u201cOver time we have convinced them we would not be doing ourselves any favours if they didn\u2019t provide visas for engineers,\u201d the bureaucrat says. \u201cIt would be self-harm on our part.\u201d\n\nApart from the commanding lead China holds in critical industries, and the bigger subsidies it pours into them, Beijing is also far better endowed with critical minerals such as lithium. Here too the Modi government is making a belated push to secure mining rights in places like Argentina, though it does not yet have much to show for the process.\n\nWith perhaps more success, New Delhi appears to have been pushing some Chinese investors that want to work in India into joint ventures with local interests \u2014 an echo of Beijing\u2019s own policy decades ago of demanding tie-ups in sectors like carmaking to ensure a transfer of skills and intellectual property.\n\nIn March, China\u2019s SAIC Motor, which owns the MG brand, announced a partnership with Indian steelmaker JWS to produce and sell cars in India. A number of the mainland Chinese companies that supply Apple via its Taiwanese contract manufacturers have also formed JVs with Indian partners and received government approval, Indian government officials told the FT, although it is unclear how many are actually operating.\n\nBut, at the end of July, India\u2019s commerce minister Piyush Goyal told reporters that the government was not rethinking its overall hawkish stance on Chinese investment.\n\n\u201cIndia will probably make exceptions, but there is unlikely to be a blanket lifting of restrictions,\u201d says Madan at Brookings.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s competition with and concerns about China will persist.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some companies are quietly working to extricate themselves from Chinese supply chains.\n\nMore than 350 miles further south from Mahindra\u2019s research and testing facilities in Tamil Nadu, Tata Power is manufacturing some of the core building blocks for Indian green power at a solar panel factory that opened in March.\n\nWith the country\u2019s electricity demand expanding at around 8 per cent annually \u2014 a bit faster than economic growth \u2014 the spotless new facility in Tirunelveli is of critical national importance.\n\nOn a heavily mechanised line, the factory\u2019s mostly female workers are overseeing the assembly of large solar modules, for which Tata itself will be the biggest customer as one of India\u2019s leading conglomerates pushing into renewables.\n\nBut the cells that go into the modules are mostly still made in China, as are many of the machines assembling them for the venerable Indian industrial group. That is about to change: Tata is opening its own solar cell unit in Tirunelveli this month, after which it will be relying on made-in-India cells only.\n\n\u201cWe will stop importing the cells,\u201d Praveer Sinha, Tata Power\u2019s chief executive, tells the FT. \u201cWe need the security of supply.\u201d\n\nIn its push to create new supply chains not reliant on China, New Delhi has allies \u2014 notably in Washington, which is working more closely than ever with India to develop alternatives: The US International Development Finance Corporation last year approved $425mn in financing for the Tirunelveli plant.\n\nIndia\u2019s government extended PLI subsidies to support the factory, which also won incentives from Tamil Nadu, one of India\u2019s most business-friendly states. Those ramp-ups will aid India\u2019s goals to become domestically self-sufficient in the coming years, according to the National Solar Energy Federation of India.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly India is headed towards a position where in the next two to three years we will be decreasing our dependence on China to a larger extent,\u201d says Subrahmanyan Pulipaka, chief executive of the lobby group.\n\nIndia\u2019s economic survey also pointed to other manufacturing growth in areas such as toys, with Chinese imports falling from $214mn to $41.6mn in the past decade.\n\nYet in other industries, the subsidies do not appear to be working their magic. Shipments of bulk drugs and precursors from China for finished pharmaceuticals grew 5.9 per cent in the most recent financial year.\n\nEven those that import little or nothing from China, such as the Serum Institute of India \u2014 the world\u2019s largest vaccine producer \u2014 believe local manufacturers in the short term will remain dependent on cheaper raw materials from across the border.\n\n\u201cWhether they\u2019re in vaccines or pharmaceuticals, they need to be conscious of their margins,\u201d Adar Poonawalla, Serum\u2019s billionaire scion and chief executive, tells the FT.\n\nHowever, he adds, \u201cover time I see a major shift coming. In five years\u2019 time, if you were to ask me the same question, you\u2019re maybe going to see half the dependency at least.\u201d\n\nThat transformation is already being actively pursued at major Indian companies, including the Mahindra Group, whose executives are contemplating setting up a domestic EV battery plant.\n\n\u201cThe goal is very clear,\u201d says Anand Mahindra. \u201cWe will have to try to become a more value-added player in the global supply chain, particularly in areas where China has a stranglehold.\u201d\n\nData visualisation by Clara Murray", "region_codes": ["IN"],

investment cycle and rising power demand are positive indicators for the power sector.\u201d\n\nThe share sale is part of an ongoing effort by Adani Group founder Gautam Adani, India\u2019s second-richest tycoon, to move on from a range of scandals that dented his eponymous infrastructure empire, which spans ports, power and cement.\n\nAdani Group is expanding rapidly across its mainstay businesses and has increasingly diversified into new sectors, from data centres, media and consumer finance.\n\nThose moves were initially paused after US short seller Hindenburg Research last year made wide-ranging allegations that the conglomerate engaged in \u201cbrazen\u201d fraud and market manipulation.\n\nThe publication of Hindenburg\u2019s extensive report into the company caused a roughly $140bn sell-off across Adani\u2019s listed stocks, as well as political attacks on the tycoon\u2019s perceived cosy relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe stock price collapse also prompted the conglomerate\u2019s flagship business incubator Adani Enterprises to halt a $2.5bn share placement.\n\nThe group has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and shares across its public companies have largely since recovered.\n\nAdani, who has openly tied his business interests to Modi\u2019s development agenda that aims to build out India\u2019s once decrepit national infrastructure, spent much of the past year deleveraging its debt-laden companies following Hindenburg\u2019s broadside.\n\nThe group, which has extensive business interests in coal, is also at the forefront of India\u2019s renewable energy drive, which aims to more than double green generation in the coal power dependent country to 500 gigawatts by 2030.\n\nAnalysts at investment bank Jefferies last month said Adani Energy Solutions had lost market share in the past financial year thanks to the conglomerate\u2019s \u201cfinancial consolidation\u201d and \u201ctad aggressive\u201d transmission sector bidding.\n\nHowever, they expect the company to recover as Adani\u2019s management looks to spend about $100bn on energy transition and digital infrastructure over the next

"body": "Indian authorities have hit leading IT outsourcer Infosys with a $3.9bn tax demand, making it one of the latest of the country\u2019s corporate champions to run afoul of government revenue collectors.\n\nInfosys confirmed the Rs324bn tax bill just as the Indian IT industry showed signs of a nascent recovery following a worldwide tech spending slowdown.\n\nThe country\u2019s second-largest IT outsourcer said on Wednesday it had been issued notices for payment of goods and services tax by agencies in its home state of Karnataka and from the national Directorate General of GST Intelligence for the period of July 2017 to March 2022.\n\nThe tax demand related to \u201cexpenses incurred by overseas branch offices\u201d, said Infosys, which is headquartered in the Karnataka capital of Bengaluru, India\u2019s Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cThe company believes that as per regulations, GST is not applicable on these expenses,\u201d it said.\n\nInfosys is one of many large Indian and overseas corporations that have been frequently stung by backdated tax claims from officials in the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy. The abrupt levies and other concerns about tax enforcement have sometimes overshadowed the growing international enthusiasm towards the country as an investment destination.\n\nForeign and local companies often find themselves mired in lengthy legal battles contesting demands and many grumble about India\u2019s opaque and onerous tax regulation. Vodafone and Cairn Energy spent years disputing high-profile, multibillion-dollar retrospective tax disputes with India\u2019s government, eventually claiming victory.\n\nLast year, Indian authorities suddenly sent notices to the country\u2019s fantasy sports and gaming companies for hundreds of millions of dollars in back taxes.\n\nCiting a recent notice from Indian agencies, Infosys said \u201cservices provided by the overseas branches to Indian entity are not subject to GST\u201d. The company added that it was \u201cfully in compliance\u201d with regulations and \u201cin fact eligible for credit or refunds for its exports of IT services\u201d.\n\nNews of the tax demand came after Infosys and other industry bellwethers, including Tata Consultancy Services, posted buoyant quarterly earnings earlier in July. The results bolstered optimism that a drought in global tech spending might be ending as demand recovers from the financial sector customers that provide most of their business.\n\nTech services are one of India\u2019s global success stories and a big source of white-collar employment for the world\u2019s most populous country as it struggles to create jobs for a growing young workforce.\n\nThe industry \u2014 much of it based in Bengaluru \u2014 was also spooked by an attempt this month by Karnataka\u2019s government, which is controlled by the Indian National Congress, the country\u2019s main opposition party, to force companies to give up to 70 per cent of jobs to locals in the state.\n\nThe state\u2019s chief minister put the new rules on hold after virulent opposition from companies and industry lobby groups in the tech hub, which is also the location of substantial operations for prominent foreign companies from Walmart to Goldman Sachs and for thousands of start-ups.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/515a716c-96dc-4a3a-a28f-1a8bf7829c53"}}, {"id": "eff73f3a-37bf-4c30-8b2b-75eb18e2a93e", "event_name": "India expands airport facial recognition amid surveillance fears", "blurb": "Digital initiative chief claims technology can halve queueing times and pledges transparency on personal data", "date": "2024-07-3000:00:00.0", "body": "India is rapidly rolling out facial recognition technology at airports, streamlining security checks amid concern about the emergence of a surveillance state in the world\u2019s largest democracy.\n\nThe use of digital biometric systems doubled last month to 28 airports, covering about 90 per cent of India\u2019s sky-bound travel volumes, according to Suresh Khadakbhavi, chief executive of the Digi Yatra Foundation, an industry-led initiative co-ordinated by the country\u2019s civil aviation ministry.\n\nSince launching in December 2022, Digi Yatra has become a critical part of the government\u2019s ambition to turn India into a global aviation hub. The voluntary system, which eliminates the need for airport boarding pass or ID checks for domestic passengers who submit a selfie photograph in advance, is marketed as a measure to ease bottlenecks as terminals cope with burgeoning passenger numbers.\n\n\u201cYou need to have efficient processes in the airport,\u201d Khadakbhavi told the Financial Times in an interview, adding that the technology had more than halved queueing times.\n\nHowever, Digi Yatra\u2019s growing reach has fed into wider concerns about the handling of passenger data amid fears that the world\u2019s most populous country is transforming into a surveillance state.\n\nIndia\u2019s government imposes the most internet shutdowns globally and has issued more than 1.3bn biometric identity cards linked to bank accounts and phones. The IDs are used to access government services, including pensions and welfare payments.\n\nAbout 3.8mn Indians have enrolled with Digi Yatra and Khadakbhavi expects that number to reach about 10mn this year. Its app may be expanded for foreigners in about a month, he added, with testing already conducted to process electronic passports.\n\nKhadakbhavi\u2019s organisation, jointly owned by five major domestic airports and the aviation authority, is in talks with India\u2019s government and immigration agency to greenlight the technology for cross border travel.\n\nBut some groups have questioned the security of data processed by Digi Yatra in a country that has yet to implement the digital privacy law that was enacted last year.\n\nIn early July, government think-tank Niti Aayog urged Digi Yatra to provide a clear statement on its data protection policies and conduct regular independent audits.\n\nKhadakbhavi conceded that Digi Yatra \u201cdid not focus\u201d on public messaging in the rush to scale up. He said his organisation and the government could not access passenger data, which was \u201cpurged systematically\u201d within 24 hours of departure.\n\n\u201cA lot of people do not know actually what we do and therefore all these questions about data privacy, surveillance are coming up,\u201d Khadakbhavi said. \u201cThe fundamental point is that I do not have your data.\u201d\n\nBut the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights organisation that has called for the technology to be removed from airports, has argued that Digi Yatra\u2019s policy published by the Ministry of Civil Aviation allows for data to be accessed by government agencies and purge settings to be changed for security requests.\n\nDigi Yatra\u2019s assurances are not \u201ccorroborated in policy\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009in fact, some of it contradicts it\u201d, said Disha Verma, associate policy counsel at the IFF. \u201cWhat is needed is evidence and what is needed is transparency by design so that we don\u2019t have to go run around like headless chickens trying to wonder where our data is going.\u201d\n\nTo address concerns, Digi Yatra may make its audits and balance sheet information public by the end of the year, as well as issue notifications when users\u2019 data has been erased, Khadakbhavi said.\n\n\u201cWe are already thinking along those lines,\u201d said Khadakbhavi. \u201cWe are getting our house in order from that perspective.\u201d\n\nIndian flyers have also claimed coercion to sign up. A survey published this year by polling organisation LocalCircles found 29 per cent of passengers enrolled at Delhi airport did so unknowingly.\n\nDigi Yatra\u2019s chief said some staff had wrongly pressed consent buttons instead of the passengers themselves. \u201cThis is something we have already taken up with airports and it\u2019s something which is only a passing phase.\u201d\n\nDown the line, Digi Yatra could also be expanded to railways, hotels and national monuments. \u201cUmpteen number of use cases in the future are possible,\u201d said Khadakbhavi.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/f1ba12ac-fe1d-4a51-b2e7-077f392115a7"}}, {"id": "7bd5c071-a8cd-47a7-8bc7-6527d49d3c2a", "event_name": "Citi feels the heat over India\u2019s job numbers", "blurb": "Reaction to forecasts by the bank point to the political sensitivity of research in the country", "date": "2024-07-2900:00:00.0", "body": "Earlier this month, researchers at Citigroup painted a less-than-rosy picture of India\u2019s briskly expanding but deeply uneven economy \u2014 one which has struggled to seize the opportunities of its demographic bulge.\n\nThe bank\u2019s economists estimated that even if India\u2019s real GDP continues to grow at a clip of 7 per cent, the country can only generate up to 9mn jobs a year \u2014 falling short of the roughly 12mn needed to absorb its youthful labour force.\n\n\u201cWith the risk of automation and mechanisation lowering employment elasticity even further, a higher than 7 per cent GDP growth is required to satiate India\u2019s job needs,\u201d they wrote in a stark analysis coupled with detailed policy recommendations.\n\nAs India tries to position itself as an alternative manufacturing rival to China, the focus on employment shortfalls remains a sore spot for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government. Despite trumpeting India\u2019s growing global status, frustration over jobs appears to have cost his Bharatiya Janata party at the ballot box where it was eased out of its parliamentary majority in June.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive topic, especially after the election,\u201d said one Indian banker.\n\nSo when Citi\u2019s report was picked up and amplified across the media, India\u2019s Ministry of Labour & Employment issued a \u201crebuttal\u201d against the Wall Street lender, which it said \u201cfails to account for the comprehensive and positive employment data available from official sources\u201d.\n\nCoincidentally, the Reserve Bank of India had chimed in earlier that day. For the first time the central bank released provisional, rather than historic, data that estimated the country added 46.7mn jobs in the fiscal year that ended in March, overshooting private surveys.\n\nEven though Citi had included government and central bank data in its forecasts, the quality of India\u2019s economic data has been questioned, including the official unemployment rate of 3.2 per cent that some argue shrouds serious levels of low-productivity underemployment.\n\nMany analysts instead cite numbers from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a Mumbai think-tank, which estimates an 8.2 per cent joblessness rate and startling youth unemployment of more than 40 per cent. They believe this presents a more realistic picture.\n\nMore widely, some analysts say the government\u2019s denunciation of Citi speaks to its sensitivity towards even constructive criticism.\n\nHemindra Hazari, an independent banking analyst in Mumbai, said it is \u201cvery difficult\u201d to do any form of critical research in the country. Write negatively about companies and government officials and \u201cthey won\u2019t give you meetings with your institutional clients, they won\u2019t accept your invitations for conferences\u201d, he said. \u201cEverybody practises self-censorship\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it\u2019s a highly incestuous world, globally also, India more so.\u201d\n\nThose who have had the temerity to suggest that not all is well in Modi\u2019s amrit kaal \u2014 his often cited Sanskrit phrase meaning \u201ctime of nectar\u201d \u2014 say they have felt the consequences.\n\nOne Indian fund manager told me they faced intense regulator scrutiny after a television interview in which they questioned the economic sense of Modi\u2019s sudden act of demonetisation in 2016, which removed much of India\u2019s currency from circulation.\n\nA more recent furore emerged when Amit Syngle, chief executive of Indian decorative group and economic barometer Asian Paints, suggested that the country\u2019s growth statistics weren\u2019t reflective of weaker realities on the ground.\n\n\u201cGDP correlation has really gone for a toss in the current year,\u201d he told analysts during a May conference call. \u201cI am not very sure as to how the GDP numbers are coming.\u201d\n\nSyngle\u2019s comments were picked up by India\u2019s opposition during the county\u2019s elections. It prompted the company to later state the CEO had been \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d and had \u201cnot, in any way, meant to question the sanctity of the GDP numbers\u201d.\n\nSome brave economists remain willing to stick their necks out.

The US is a notable absentee from the list.\n\nReynolds indicated he wanted to resume talks with the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council along with India in an effort to secure free trade agreements once targeted by the Conservative government.\n\nBoth deals have proved harder to secure than many Brexiters would have liked.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has also indicated he wants an improved trading relationship with the EU that stops short of rejoining the single market or customs union.\n\nReynolds said the government planned to publish a trade strategy that aligned with its industrial strategy, enhancing economic security and supporting its net zero ambitions.\n\n\u201cBoosting trade abroad is essential to deliver a strong economy at home,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cI\u2019ve wasted no time taking stock of progress and getting ready to press on with trade talks with our international partners.\n\n\u201cFrom the Gulf to India, our trade programme is ambitious and plays to the UK\u2019s strengths to give British businesses access to some of the most exciting economies in the world.\n\n\u201cOur teams will be entering negotiating rooms as soon as possible, laser-focused on creating new opportunities for UK firms so they can support jobs across the country and deliver the growth we desperately need.\u201d\n\nReynolds hopes to have British negotiators working with their counterparts by the autumn.\n\nThe government claims that a trade agreement with the GCC would provide a substantial economic opportunity, as some \u00a319bn in total had already been invested in each other\u2019s economies by 2021.\n\nTalks on an FTA with the six GCC states \u2014 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 started under the Tory government in 2022.\n\nAt the time, the international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the prospective agreement would target a \u00a31.6bn annual boost to the UK economy, from increased exports of manufactured goods and agricultural produce to financial and digital services.\n\nBut after an initial burst of post-Brexit activity, concerns grew in Whitehall about the danger of rushing into trade deals. A 2021 deal with Australia secured by Liz Truss, who was trade secretary at the time, was much criticised. Some Tory MPs saw it as one-sided and detrimental to British farmers.\n\nDavid Lammy, UK foreign secretary, visited India this month to discuss trade talks restarting after they were suspended because of elections in both countries.

Now it\u2019s close to 20 per cent,\u201d said Kunjal Gala, head of global emerging markets at Federated Hermes. Because Indian shares are already relatively pricey, the index shift \u201cposes an interesting dilemma for long-term investors like us, or investors who are more focused on \u2018margin of safety\u2019 valuations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are slightly underweight India at the moment, not because we don\u2019t like India as a country from a top-down, macro perspective\u201d, but because of that focus on margin of safety or trying to buy up stocks at prices much less than their intrinsic value, Gala said.\n\nDomestic inflows into equity funds have been a critical factor. Average annual net domestic flow into equities was $12bn between 2016 and 2020. Between 2021-2023 these annual flows had swelled to $29bn, Laijawalla said.\n\nDespite scepticism about the sustainability of these flows and valuations, part of the dilemma for investors is that it has been very costly in the past to miss out on Indian stocks.\n\nIndia has been among the best-performing markets in the world in local currency terms and kept pace with US markets in dollar terms in recent decades.\n\nIt has also been the world\u2019s best market for so-called \u201cmulti-baggers\u201d or stocks that have risen at least 10-fold, according to Vikas Pershad, a portfolio manager at M&G Investments.\n\n\u201cOne of the least relevant financial indicators anywhere, but especially in India, is the one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio,\u201d Pershad said. \u201cThis is why, for 20 years, investors have missed out on returns in India.\u201d\n\nConsensus forward earnings per share estimates for Indian constituents in the MSCI emerging markets index are in the mid-teens for this year and next, according to Bloomberg data, similar to other emerging markets.\n\nWhile Indian company earnings are climbing, the pace is not faster than other emerging markets. \u201cThe profit growth in India is actually ordinary,\u201d said Sunil Tirumalai, global emerging markets strategist at UBS.\n\nBut while Chinese company valuations have deflated in the last couple of years, India\u2019s have done the opposite, in part driven by a retail investment boom.\n\nMany Indian households are pouring money into domestic equities to offset what are seen as low interest rates, which at best only equal official inflation.\n\nDomestic buying, often via automated monthly transfers to funds run by large banks such as ICICI, has easily countered the shift away from India by foreign institutions. \u201cForeign ownership has fallen to a 11 year low,\u201d according to Tirumalai.\n\n\u201cOn an aggregate basis, global investors are still underweight India,\u201d partly because of valuations, Vivian Lin Thurston, a portfolio manager at William Blair Investment Management, said. \u201cAs the Indian weight is increasing, it gets harder for them to find attractive value stocks in India, or they will need to rethink their valuation metrics.\u201d\n\nAfter the expansion of mainland listed companies in 2019, China\u2019s weighting soared in the index soared the following year. Even then, mainland stocks are still not fully included.\n\n\u201cHistorically, whenever countries have hit a 25 per cent weight in the MSCI EM Index, they have tended to fall back from their highs,\u201d said Jitania Kandhari, managing director on the emerging markets equity team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3f34e4f7-b9a5-4508-80ed-bfda414f9324"}}, {"id": "8314e012-38da-48a3-a496-18e7eaca00a0", "event_name": "India unveils spending binge to boost Narendra Modi\u2019s allies", "blurb": "BJP\u2019s budget seeks to tackle joblessness and cut fiscal deficit after shock loss of majority", "date": "2024-07-2300:00:00.0", "body": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has announced a spending splurge for its new coalition partners alongside job creation schemes in an effort to shore up public support following a shock election setback last month.\n\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party was elected to a historic third term in June but lost its ruling majority, making it dependent on two regional parties to form a governing coalition.\n\nIn the new government\u2019s first annual budget, for the year ended March 2025, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday announced plans to keep capital investment at a record Rs11.11tn ($133bn) while trimming the fiscal deficit to 4.9 per cent of GDP, from its current 5.1 per cent target.\n\nSitharaman described India, the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy, as \u201cthe shining exception\u201d to slowing global growth. The economy is estimated to expand between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent this year.\n\nModi said the budget would \u201cdecide the direction for the next five years of our term [and] become a strong foundation of our dream of a Viksit Bharat [developed India]\u201d.\n\nMuch of Sitharamana\u2019s budget speech detailed billions of dollars worth of spending for the government\u2019s coalition partners, the Telugu Desam party of southern Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) from Bihar in the north.\n\nThis included a Rs260bn industrial corridor running through Bihar, Rs150bn for a new \u201chigh-tech\u201d capital in Andhra Pradesh called Amaravati and funds for flood reconstruction and developing local temples.\n\nThe government\u2019s budgetary firepower was bolstered by a record Rs2.1tn transfer from the Reserve Bank of India, giving it room to continue spending while lowering its fiscal deficit target. Sitharaman said the government aimed to bring the deficit under 4.5 per cent the following year.\n\nAndrew Holland, chief executive of Mumbai-based Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies, said the budget was likely to \u201calleviate any worries about any coalition problems\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of the RBI dividend has obviously gone towards rural development, jobs and Andhra Pradesh and Bihar,\u201d he said.\n\nThe BJP also sought to mollify widespread public frustration that many analysts blamed for its electoral disappointment, announcing schemes to tackle youth joblessness and boost agricultural productivity for farmers.\n\nJairam Ramesh, a spokesperson for the opposition Indian National Congress, called the budget \u201cfar too late and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009far too little\u201d, adding that the government \u201cseems to have finally come around to tacitly admitting that mass unemployment is a national crisis\u201d.\n\nIndia\u2019s benchmark Nifty 50 index fell more than 1 per cent following the budget speech, after the government announced that it would raise the country\u2019s short- and long-term capital gains tax. Yields on 10-year government bonds fell to a two-year low on plans to cut borrowing levels.\n\n\u201cThe market will definitely have some knee-jerk reaction, but will definitely even out,\u201d said Abhay Agarwal, founder and fund manager at Piper Serica in Mumbai. \u201cMore important [is] the focus of continuing to invest in infrastructure of all kinds.\u201d\n\nIndia, which last year became the world\u2019s most populous country, has sought to capitalise on global investor interest in its economy as manufacturers and tech companies seek an alternative to China. It has attracted Apple to assemble iPhones in India, as well as a growing number of so-called global capability centres, in-house back offices for multinationals.\n\nBut its economy has been plagued by chronic weaknesses including low job creation, rising inequality and tepid private investment.\n\nThe budget \u201cstruck broadly the right notes on the important issues\u201d including employment creation, maintaining macroeconomic stability and reducing the fiscal deficit, said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, an economist and former deputy chair of India\u2019s planning commission.\n\nBut he added that the success of programmes to address employment, agriculture and urban development \u201cwill all depend on how well the schemes are designed and how well they\u2019re implemented\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had these schemes before,\u201d he said.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/ca9349ec-1cd9-4985-aa1f-4e96605f46e7"}}, {"id": "b196a8f7-877e-4e3f-9525-4bafa6ab6543", "event_name": "India\u2019s Narendra Modi faces budget demands from \u2018kingmaker\u2019 allies ", "blurb": "Humbled prime minister must compromise with coalition allies while addressing gloom that led to loss of his party\u2019s majority", "date": "2024-07-2200:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s Narendra Modi faces an early test to his third term in office as the prime minister prepares to unveil a budget that must balance the demands of new coalition partners while putting forward an economic vision that reinforces confidence after an unexpected election disappointment.\n\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party was re-elected to a historic third term in June but unexpectedly lost its parliamentary majority, forcing the prime minister to depend on two regional \u201ckingmakers\u201d to see off a resurgent opposition.\n\nThose allies, the Telugu Desam party from southern Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) in northern Bihar, are demanding billions of dollars in financing for their states ahead of the government\u2019s first budget, which will be delivered on Tuesday for the financial year ending March 2025.\n\nNeelayapalem Vijay Kumar, a spokesperson for the TDP, said the party wanted to \u201cutilise the clout\u201d it has as a coalition partner to secure funding for roads, an oil refinery and Amaravati, a new \u201chigh-tech\u201d state capital.\n\nThe JDU, meanwhile, has requested airports, medical colleges and infrastructure projects including power plants and new roads. \u201cA new government has been formed and our party, the JDU, is part of that,\u201d said spokesperson Kishan Chand Tyagi. \u201cThe expectations of the people of Bihar have risen.\u201d\n\nNomura estimates that requests from coalition partners could cost about 0.2 per cent of India\u2019s GDP this year.\n\nModi, a domineering leader known for bold, surprise announcements, has never ruled in a minority government. Investors are watching closely for an early indication of whether he can adapt to the compromises required of coalition politics, while continuing the fiscal consolidation and business-friendly reforms that he hopes will make India a global manufacturing and tech hub to rival China.\n\n\u201cEconomic transformation wouldn\u2019t have happened if Modi hadn\u2019t forced it,\u201d said one person close to the party. But they added that the BJP would have to \u201cchange their style of working, be a little more accommodative and make some allies along the way \u2014 whether that will be adequate, I don\u2019t know\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister also faces popular anger over chronic hardship in rural areas and widespread joblessness in the country of 1.4bn, despite economic growth of more than 6 per cent a year. Finding solutions for these problems, which many analysts blame for the BJP\u2019s disappointing election performance, will be essential to securing his domestic position and quelling questions about how many more years he should remain in charge.\n\nShumita Deveshwar, senior director of India research at GlobalData TS Lombard, said one of the government\u2019s strengths was its ability to \u201cportray itself to investors well\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut, on the other side, we\u2019ve seen with the election results that people are getting impatient, and voters are looking to see what the government will do next,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no quick fix.\u201d\n\nThe BJP, which has in recent years increased spending on infrastructure, welfare and subsidy schemes to attract foreign manufacturers, has dismissed concerns about its record and appointed a largely unchanged cabinet last month.\n\nThe new budget will be buoyed by a record Rs2.1tn ($25bn) transfer from the Reserve Bank of India this year, part of an annual payout from the bank\u2019s surplus funds.\n\nAnalysts expect this extra cash should help Modi\u2019s government maintain or even lower the fiscal deficit from its current target of 5.1 per cent, compared with 5.8 per cent the previous fiscal year, even if it increases spending on infrastructure or for coalition states.\n\nThe coalition partners \u201care fully aligned\u201d with the BJP\u2019s economic vision, said Narendra Taneja, a former spokesperson for the ruling party. \u201cThere will always be people who will be submitting a wish list\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but are there any serious differences? No. Is there any bad blood? No.\u201d\n\nModi\u2019s return has been welcomed by big businesses that have thrived on BJP policies such as corporate tax cuts. \u201cThey will not fix what is not broken,\u201d said R Shankar Raman, chief financial officer of Larsen & Toubro, India\u2019s largest engineering and construction company, which has been in talks to restart development of the city of Amaravati. \u201cThere is merit in continuity.\u201d\n\nBut the BJP also enters its third term saddled with daunting economic challenges. Private investment has not picked up and inequality has risen to a historic level under Modi, with the richest 1 per cent of Indians holding 40 per cent of the nation\u2019s wealth, according to a paper this year from the World Inequality Lab. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy put youth unemployment at 45 per cent last year.\n\nModi may have limited time to show results. Two BJP-controlled and allied states, the business hubs of Maharashtra and Haryana, will hold elections this year, and analysts expect a tough fight after the opposition made strong gains during the parliamentary polls.\n\nPronab Sen, India\u2019s former chief statistician, warned that perceptions of favouritism to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar in the budget would \u201copen a can of worms\u201d and inflame tensions with other states.\n\nBut he suggested that India\u2019s new political landscape could prove an economic boon if the BJP becomes adept at consensus-building, which could help it push through more economic reforms.\n\n\u201cWhat was happening at least over the last six, seven years was that most decision-making was completely unilateral,\u201d he said. Now, \u201cthey\u2019re going to have to convince their partners, [and] if they\u2019re sensible they\u2019ll open it up further to all states\u201d.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5282c407-1995-4d29-b5cd-176ad84e2a40"}}, {"id": "96030f77-6420-4bf8-b7e8-61ff87fe89be", "event_name": "The young investors gambling on Indian stocks", "blurb": "Millions of India\u2019s citizens have piled into shares and options, egged on by online \u2018finfluencers\u2019, but regulators are sounding the alarm", "date": "2024-07-1800:00:00.0", "body": "\u201cHow many of you want to be rich?\u201d Hundreds of hands shoot up at a packed conference hall in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru.\n\nThe attendees are responding to Chandan Taparia, head of derivatives research at financial group Motilal Oswal. Roaming the stage as an array of technical charts pop up on screen, Taparia shares his market trading tricks to the fixated assembly of largely young Indian men hanging on his every word and intently jotting down strategies on a recent Sunday.\n\n\u201cFriends, if you follow this, trust me, you won\u2019t lose,\u201d Taparia notes in an aside. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take risks, you cannot survive in the market, you cannot achieve your goal,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf you win, you can rule the world.\u201d\n\nTaparia is one of a batch of financial influencers giving masterclasses to crowds of small-time derivatives dabblers, many of whom have travelled hundreds of miles to attend the Bharat Option Traders Summit. The nationwide series of day-long seminars, held in Indian regional languages across cities from Kochi to Lucknow, is tapping frenzied enthusiasm for trading among the country\u2019s vast millennial and Gen Z cohort.\n\nThe scene speaks to the transformation that has recently taken place in Indian equity markets, once considered a barely investable backwater by global portfolio managers, as tens of millions of first-time domestic investors have piled into stocks and mutual funds.\n\nPartly as a result, the benchmark Nifty 50 index of large Indian companies has doubled over the past five years, beating Japan\u2019s resurgent Nikkei 225 and trouncing China\u2019s Shanghai Composite. Not even America\u2019s S&P 500, with six companies worth $1tn or more, has kept pace.\n\nThat outperformance has turned the country\u2019s stocks into a favourite with global investors, who have increasingly shunned Chinese equities amid a domestic slowdown and geopolitical tensions with the US. Trading volumes of options on Indian equities have even eclipsed those on Wall Street stocks, while high-speed trading firm Jane Street reportedly made $1bn on Indian option trades last year, according to details revealed in a New York lawsuit.\n\nBut the surge in domestic investing has also pushed valuations ever higher, with the MSCI India index trading at an average 58 per cent premium to the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index over the past three years, according to asset manager Robeco. Some investors fear this rising enthusiasm is fuelling a speculative bubble that increasingly resembles a local version of the GameStop craze among US retail investors in 2021.\n\nDespite living in the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy, hundreds of millions of Indians still face high unemployment, stagnant wages and a widening gulf with the country\u2019s wealthy elite. This has made the prospect of fast fortunes, egged on by popular but largely unregulated \u201cfinfluencers\u201d, all the more appealing.\n\nA proliferation of discount brokerages, along with boredom during the Covid-19 lockdowns, have helped turn cheap zero-day options \u2014 derivatives that expire on the same day they are created \u2014 into the hottest ticket in the market after being introduced in India three years ago.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of speculative activity and it is sounding like a casino,\u201d says Raamdeo Agrawal, chair of Motilal Oswal, which has millions of clients across India and co-sponsored the options summit roadshow. \u201cThe masses are really writing puts, selling puts, doing restructured calls. I mean, this is crazy stuff.\u201d\n\nEven Ashok Devanampriya, organiser of the Bharat Options Traders Summit and founder of Bengaluru-based Cautilya Capital, acknowledges that only 1 per cent of the crowd will ever make money.\n\nIndia\u2019s brokerages, bourses and government may be enjoying swelling fee income and tax revenues from this rapid expansion, but the country\u2019s capital market watchdog has repeatedly sounded warnings over retail losses as the notional value of index options trades more than doubled in the past financial year to $907tn, according to exchange operator NSE.\n\nCheap access to options, whose leverage facilitates high exposure for modest outlay but magnifies the risk of losses, has resulted in what Ashish Gupta, chief investment officer at Mumbai-headquartered Axis Mutual Fund, calls the \u201cgamification\u201d of the stock market.\n\n\u201cIn India, there\u2019s no other form of legalised gambling,\u201d Gupta says. His research found that active traders in the country shot up to 4mn last year from less than half a million before the pandemic. Most are below the age of 40 and hail largely from India\u2019s smaller cities.\n\nThe addictive nature of those wagers, as well as the fantasy of quick riches, has enticed Indians such as Akash MB, a 30-year-old attendee at the Bengaluru summit. Two years ago he quit his sales job and began actively trading. \u201cI want to make money and be profitable.\u201d\n\nHis initial losses were the equivalent of $2,400, not far off India\u2019s per capita gross domestic product. But he believes that with more experience and by doing options trading \u201cwe can make money today, we can make it now\u201d.\n\nSome veteran fund managers have looked upon the craze with disdain, including Rajiv Jain, founder of Florida-based GQG Partners with Indian investments valued at more than $20bn. \u201cThere should be a crackdown in that area, just to take the air out,\u201d Jain says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the benefit to society from all these young people speculating?\u201d\n\nBefore India started dismantling its socialist economy in the 1990s there were few direct retail investors in its sluggish equity market. Even after the country opened up, public trust remained low after a spat of infamous stock scams.\n\nBut as India\u2019s economy picked up its capital markets modernised, introducing innovations such as online trading and centralised clearing. Easily forged paper-share certificates are being replaced with electronic records of share ownership.\n\nA small but expanding middle class with surplus savings has since led a historic democratisation of finance in the world\u2019s most populous country, helped by rapid economic growth and the spread of bank accounts, mobile phones and low-cost brokerages. Generations of families who previously hid spare cash under the bed or bought gold, piled into stocks and mutual funds.\n\nThis has been helped by a publicity blitz. During last month\u2019s T20 Cricket World Cup, which India won, breaks in play were dominated by adverts for low-cost brokerages and mutual funds featuring stars such as national team captain Rohit Sharma.\n\n\u201cA whole generation of people were sitting on the fence and thinking whether they should trade or not trade, and they\u2019ve all jumped in,\u201d says Nithin Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha, one of India\u2019s largest low-cost brokerages with about Rs4.5tn assets under management. \u201cThe last four or five years have been phenomenal.\u201d\n\nThe number of investor accounts in India has more than tripled to around 160mn since 2020, according to HSBC Asset Management. Mutual fund industry net assets under management doubled to Rs59tn ($706bn) in May.\n\nThe robust financial performance of Indian companies has also underpinned the market. Macquarie, the Australian bank and asset manager, has estimated Indian earnings per share will grow 14 per cent this year and next, outpacing other emerging markets. Indian debt is also becoming more accessible, with the inclusion of government bonds in JPMorgan\u2019s emerging markets index for the first time last month set to attract billions of dollars in foreign inflows.\n\n\u201cIf you have an EM mandate and you want to not upset your holders by being too big in China, you have relatively few options,\u201d says Farida Khambata, co-founder of Washington-based investment firm Cartica Management. \u201cYou can be in Brazil for commodity markets, you can be in Korea and Taiwan as tech markets \u2014 and then you have the deep domestic market that India provides.\u201d\n\nThat homegrown investor base means that India \u2014 once famously described by Morgan Stanley as one of the \u201cFragile Five\u201d countries excessively dependent on foreign funds \u2014 is no longer as vulnerable to market corrections due to outflows, according to Khambata. \u201cEarlier it was the \u2018America sneezes, the world catches pneumonia\u2019 story,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving a domestic underpinning has completely changed the dynamic.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s bourses have also introduced new derivative products and reduced minimum option trading sizes. That, along with demand for quick returns, has triggered a surge in retail players in those securities. The notional trading volumes of options on the Nifty 50 index averaged about $1.64tn a day this year, surpassing the S&P 500\u2019s $1.44tn, according to Bank of America.\n\nOverseas funds have taken notice and one Mumbai-based investment banker said Jane Street\u2019s apparent success in India \u201chad people sitting up and saying \u2018shit there\u2019s money to be made in India\u2019\u201d.\n\nBut some analysts fear the heady demand for Indian stocks could end in a severe correction that stops this financial democratisation in its tracks and scare away the new generation of investors, as the dotcom bust of the early 2000s did in Europe.\n\nAndrei Stetsenko, a partner at New York-based Farley Capital, says inflows into Indian mutual funds could be hit \u201cwhen the inevitable correction comes\u201d.\n\nBut he was sceptical that this would derail the trajectory of Indian investing. Only 7 per cent of Indian household financial assets are held in equities or mutual funds, according to asset manager Polen Capital. That compares to 50 per cent in the US and 41 per cent in China. More than half remain in bank deposits, which shows there is still room for growth, Stetsenko argues.\n\n\u201cThere will always be a risk of a correction,\u201d he says. \u201cThe beauty of that is that it\u2019s an opportunity to add to positions that you believe in.\u201d\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India is also growing concerned about the explosion of risk-taking.\n\nOne of the regulator\u2019s targets is P R Sundar, a 60-year-old former maths teacher who became an unlikely options trading guru after he began regularly posting YouTube videos in 2020, during India\u2019s first national Covid lockdown.\n\nTo their fans, finfluencers like Sundar \u2014 who has amassed more than 1mn followers and keeps a Rolls-Royce Phantom outside his office complex in Chennai \u2014 have helped demystify complex financial products, becoming aspirational role models to those looking to make fortunes in the market.\n\nThe son of an unskilled labourer, Sundar likes to reiterate his rags-to-riches story. He began investing in 2007 with savings of about $30,000 after returning to India following a 12-year teaching stint in Singapore. He now puts his net worth at about $12mn, which he attributes to his success in options and teaching novice traders.\n\nHis website advertises training sessions starting at about $700 and demands a minimum capital of $12,000 to participate, which Sundar says weeds out those who cannot afford the inherent market risks. He warns \u201cthe stock market is the hardest place to make easy money\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009there are so many people who can come to social media and say: \u2018I\u2019m a successful trader\u2019, 95 per cent are frauds.\u201d\n\nSundar himself has faced criticism that he only posts winning trades and makes more money through training programmes. He has dismissed those claims and says his share of earnings fluctuates. \u201cIf we keep on losing money, how can a person live my standard of living?\u201d Sundar says, citing his love of flashy cars. \u201cLossmaking traders cannot afford to do that.\u201d\n\nOnly registered analysts are authorised to provide financial recommendations. But many finfluencers, who ply their advice in hard-to-police chat groups, argue they are merely providing educational services, which are permitted.\n\nSebi imposed a settlement order of more than $700,000 on Sundar, his wife and their joint consultancy after accusing them of selling daily call option advice on the Telegram messaging app without regulatory registration.\n\nSundar and his wife agreed to a one-year trading ban without admitting or denying they had broken any laws. \u201cI made some mistakes, I\u2019m not denying that,\u201d Sundar says. \u201cBut somehow I feel that the punishment given was much bigger.\u201d\n\nThe watchdog has now engaged in a wider crackdown aimed at curbing the excess in derivatives, instructing brokerages like Zerodha to include warnings that nine out of 10 options traders end up losing money.\n\nThose failed trades have had tragic consequences. In November, a 26-year-old software analyst killed himself by jumping from the 10th floor of his office building in Chennai. Police found he had taken a $12,000 bank loan and lost the money trading.\n\n\u201cThe last thing you want is a new generation of 20-year-olds, whose first experience with the market will be linked to these instruments and then they get scarred potentially for life,\u201d says Gupta at Axis Mutual Fund.\n\nIn early July, shares in listed mass-market brokerages, including Angel One and Motilal Oswal, fell after Sebi issued new rules mandating uniform charges that are not discounted for high volumes. Kamath at Zerodha says that will probably result in trading charges and the end of its zero-fee model. The regulator did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhether Sebi\u2019s actions will deter India\u2019s army of youthful market players remains to be seen. \u201cPeople are willing to take their chances\u201d given the lack of opportunities in India, says Devanampriya of Cautilya Capital, arguing the odds of young Indians securing stable, but oversubscribed government jobs are even lower.\n\n\u201cWhen you become capable and become part of the 1 per cent elite club you will start making money and naturally over time you will become an investor.\u201d\n\nHoping to join those ranks was Anand, a 23-year-old who had travelled more than 300 miles south from the city of Vijayapura to attend the Bengaluru options conference. \u201cI\u2019m a poor person,\u201d he says during a break between seminars. \u201cBut I have a big dream for my life.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/398fde10-6e63-4b01-b834-1897d6265dcd"}}, {"id": "b06c8006-8351-497c-b49c-59a6ce51ff95", "event_name": "India shifts its strategy on tech", "blurb": "Rather than encouraging social media copy cats, it is seeking more control of big foreign companies", "date": "2024-07-1600:00:00.0", "body": "With a yellow-bird logo and 400-character limit, Indian start-up Koo was never subtle about which US social media company it wanted to emulate.

Koo finally folded this month after a bailout fell apart.\n\nKoo\u2019s demise underscores the failure of efforts to replace US social media companies in India. But Modi\u2019s government now has a far more effective strategy: Control. Rule changes since 2021 are forcing foreign tech groups to fall in line. And following his re-election to a third term last month, Modi is planning much more.\n\nAround the time of the conflict with Twitter over the farmers\u2019 protests, India toughened its rules to include criminal liability for social media executives. This worked. Even self-styled free speech champion Elon Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X, has publicly acknowledged he has little choice but to comply with Indian takedown requests.\n\nModi has made stopping tech monopolies a policy platform, telling the G7 summit of global leaders last month they must \u201cmake technology creative, not destructive\u201d. His government is preparing a handful of new laws, including the Digital India Act, designed to overhaul the country\u2019s existing information technology laws, and a digital antitrust bill.\n\nIndia\u2019s move to rein in foreign tech mirrors global trends in many ways. Like Europe\u2019s Digital Markets Act, India\u2019s digital competition bill would allow authorities to pre-emptively crack down on companies before they form monopolies \u2014 rather than punishing or breaking them up after the fact.\n\nBut at its heart, India\u2019s approach stands out for what Udbhav Tiwari, director of global product policy at Mozilla, calls an attempt to create a \u201cfourth path\u201d for regulating the internet. It seeks to be lighter touch than Europe and take consumer protection more seriously than the US. But it also creates broad powers for the state to police online speech in ways critics say resembles neighbouring China more than fellow democracies.\n\nA data privacy act passed last year, for example, introduced some strong consumer protection norms for companies even as it enshrined exemptions for authorities on broad grounds including \u201cmaintenance of public order\u201d and \u201cfriendly relations with foreign states\u201d.\n\nThe ambiguity in these sorts of provisions means \u201cexecutive discretion takes over\u201d, says Prateek Waghre of the Internet Freedom Foundation, which sees an erosion of checks and balances that creates ample scope for abuse. About a third Modi term, Waghre says \u201cthe signals that have been going out have been more aggressive\u201d.\n\nForeign tech companies have made limited attempts to push back, with a US lobby group in May reportedly asking authorities to reconsider the competition law. But they have reasoned that missing out on India\u2019s fast-growing market is not an option, particularly after being shut out of China. Facebook and YouTube have more users in India than anywhere else \u2014 more than 375mn and 475mn respectively. An entrepreneur such as Musk, who wants to set up a Tesla plant in India, may decide it\u2019s not worth annoying the Modi government over how he handles posts on X.\n\nAI will be the next big test for Indian tech policy. Though it is mostly US companies like Meta and OpenAI that currently lead cutting-edge research and large-language model development, a vast amount of additional work is needed to train AI for Indian languages and package it into products for Indian consumers and companies. This is an opportunity for India to create its own AI tools, Tiwari argues, rather than simply import American tech. Given India\u2019s high ambitions, can it now innovate rather than seeking to copy or control?\n\nbenjamin.parkin@ft.com", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3400d1d3-7fce-4932-b4d3-17a98323f3df"}}, {"id": "c504cbf1-91ae-4202-b0fa-cdba1f99ef9c", "event_name": "\u2018Get us more paper\u2019: Indian equity issuance hits record high", "blurb": "Over $28bn raised in first half, almost triple the amount a year ago", "date": "2024-07-1200:00:00.0", "body": "Indian equity issuance has skyrocketed as companies take advantage of a stock market bull run and a surge in local investor flows, even though some foreign fund managers are balking at the country\u2019s richly valued shares.\n\nMore than $28bn was raised in India\u2019s equity markets in the country\u2019s busiest ever first half of the year, according to Dealogic data, a 198 per cent jump from the same period in 2023. In contrast, issuance in the rest of Asia, excluding Japan, dropped 32 per cent.\n\nThe frenetic activity across corporate India has been underpinned by the world\u2019s fastest headline growth in a large economy \u2014 forecast by the IMF to be 6.8 per cent this year \u2014 a stable currency and strong company earnings.\n\nIt has also been helped by investors selling out of China, whose equity market is down sharply in recent years, with the MSCI China underperforming the MSCI India by 61 per cent over the past three years.\n\n\u201cMarket momentum, the demand dynamic, all of that is strong,\u201d said Arvind Vashistha, head of India equity capital markets at Citigroup, the country\u2019s top equity underwriter so far this year, according to London Stock Exchange Group data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard people saying, \u2018look, get us more paper\u2019,\u201d he added, referring to investor appetite for further issuance. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that momentum really slowing down in 2024 and 2025.\u201d\n\nMore than three quarters of the issuance is in the form of secondary offerings, with multinational parent firms, Indian founders and buyout funds seeking to cash in as the shares continue to rise after an initial public offering.\n\nA number of major listings are also expected this year, including the local subsidiary of Hyundai Motors, which is expected to raise up to $3bn.\n\nFood delivery firm Swiggy has filed for a $1.3bn IPO, while electric vehicle scooter firm Ola Electric has regulatory approval to raise $660mn in its market debut.\n\nIndia is \u201ca key cornerstone of activity in the region\u201d, said Edward Byun, co-head of Asia excluding Japan ECM at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. \u201cThe market clearly wants more champions to emerge to expand investment opportunities.\u201d\n\nA key driver of local demand has been the millions of Indians who are increasingly choosing to put their savings in stocks, rather than traditional stores of wealth such as gold or real estate.\n\nAssets under management in Indian mutual equity funds have more than quadrupled to Rs27.7tn ($332bn) since March 2020, according to data compiled by Mumbai-based financial services group Motilal Oswal.\n\nHowever, many overseas investors have flinched at India\u2019s lofty valuations \u2014 the BSE Sensex currently trade at 25 times forward earnings, one of the highest levels in Asia, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nSome are also concerned about the amount of equity supply hitting the market, as well as the poor performance of many new issues: Indian IPOs on their first day of trading on average have gained 25.4 per cent, according to Dealogic, compared with the global average of 52 per cent.\n\nSecondary issues meanwhile gained 2.2 per cent in India, compared with 10 per cent globally.\n\nForeign institutional investor inflows have remained flat this year, according to data compiled by Motilal Oswal.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of trepidation,\u201d said one investment banker. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been this level of equity issuance in India before and you pair that together with the fact that valuations are near all time highs.\u201dWith the Nifty 50 having more than tripled over the past decade, \u201csome sort of correction should be expected\u201d, said Perris Lee, Asia ECM insights director at ION Analytics. \u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t stop the equity market from growing and maturing so long as the economy continues to march ahead,\u201d Lee added.\n\nHowever, others believe the high multiples are justified by the pace of growth.\n\n\u201cYou get what you pay for, the runway is long which is why the multiples can optically look big,\u201d said Rajiv Jain, chief investment officer of Florida-based GQG Partners, which has more than $20bn invested in Indian stocks.\n\nIndia \u201cis getting to the point where it is hard to ignore just simply because of the size and scale of the growth\u201d, Jain added.\n\nThe Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex have also roared ahead following a brief sell-off last month. That came after India returned a surprise election result, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party \u2014 which was seen by investors as positive for growth and stock market performance \u2014 shorn of its parliamentary majority.\n\n\u201cThankfully the election outcome has been well absorbed,\u201d said Subhrajit Roy, India head of global capital markets at Bank of America, who expects record equity issuance this year and an even stronger 2025.\n\nOutside of Hyundai\u2019s expected blockbuster IPO, which is scheduled for later this year, multiple bankers see more multinational companies eyeing up an Indian listing for their subsidiaries.\n\nDecades ago, foreign firms were delisting from India, for instance Cadbury India, said Mahavir Lunawat, founder of Pantomath Financial Services Group in Mumbai.\n\nNow \u201ca lot of such large corporations are looking at India,\u201d he added. \u201cHere is a market which has depth, which has valuation, which has demand.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/5de42624-ff07-480d-8ac8-9fbf827059ad"}}, {"id": "2e86d580-7f4c-4e51-9b80-bcbbc4fb8963", "event_name": "Forget Sun Valley, this is the hottest invite in business", "blurb": "Plus, a profile of Shein\u2019s spokesperson-in chief and why the world\u2019s biggest electric vehicle battery maker is tapping wealthy families for cash", "date": "2024-07-1200:00:00.0", "body": "One big media scoop to start: German billionaire Mathias D\u00f6pfner and private equity group KKR are negotiating a break-up of media conglomerate Axel Springer.

The New York Post reports that Raghavan has bought a nice penthouse in his new hometown.\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter:\n\nDuring a recent evening gathering \u2014 not far from the looming 400,000 square foot Tetris-like Mumbai residence of Asia\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani \u2014 a small group of executives gossiped over who had received a ticket to the hottest networking event in the world.\n\nFurther north, the crescendo of celebrations to mark the wedding of Ambani\u2019s youngest child Anant Ambani to fellow billionaire offspring, Radhika Merchant, will draw a wildly diverse range of pop stars, sporting celebrities, powerful politicians and global tycoons to India\u2019s monsoon-drenched, traffic-clogged financial capital.\n\nThe Ambanis have spared no expense, reports the FT\u2019s Chris Kay from Mumbai. Planning app Bridebook.com calls it the most expensive wedding in history, estimating the family behind India\u2019s largest company by market capitalisation has spent $664mn on the extravaganza. Here\u2019s a video dedicated solely to the unboxing of the lavish invite.\n\nMonths of extravagant prenuptial parties hosted by Ambani, chair of petrochemicals-to-telecoms conglomerate Reliance Industries, have boasted of performances from the likes of Justin Bieber, Katy Perry and Rihanna.\n\nAlready most of India\u2019s business elite, Bollywood megastars and cricketing legends such as Sachin Tendulkar, as well as US billionaires Bill Gates, Larry Fink and Mark Zuckerberg, have marked their attendance.\n\nIn a projection of unabashed power, wealth and influence, they have dragged the global A-list to Mumbai during the worst season of the year, when the megacity\u2019s already shaky infrastructure buckles under torrential lashings. Earlier this week schools were closed and the city\u2019s notorious traffic came to a standstill after a thunderous deluge caused widescale flooding.\n\nAdding to the stormy chaos, police imposed traffic restrictions from Friday afternoon to Monday evening to deal with the mob of VIPs that have left Mumbaikars fuming. The expected attendance by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of the many leaders the Ambani family have courted over the decades, is set to exacerbate the city\u2019s gridlock.\n\nThe Mumbai head of an international bank attending the bash said they were girding themselves for the congestion around the Ambani-owned Jio World Convention Centre, where the final marriage ceremony will take place.\n\nMany workers based in the area have been told to work from home.\n\nOthers who did not make the invite list have rolled their eyes at the mention of the last round of festivities. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why they had to be so public about it all,\u201d said another executive based out of an office close to the action.\n\n\u201cI guess when you get to that level you don\u2019t really have friends, you just have chess pieces to move around the board or rivals to outmanoeuvre.\u201d\n\nWhen he was 17, Donald Tang moved to the US \u201cfor love\u201d with just $20 in his pocket.\n\nSince that journey to California from his native China in 1982, he has worked in jobs ranging from dishwasher to Bear Stearns investment banker.\n\nFour decades later, Tang was drafted in by Xu Yangtian, who also goes by Sky Xu, the reclusive co-founder of the online fast-fashion giant Shein for what has proved to be his most high-profile role yet: serving as the face of the company as it pursues an initial public offering.\n\nTang formally joined Shein in November 2022 as executive vice-chair to help lead its rapid expansion overseas and eventually prepare it for a stock market listing, reports the FT\u2019s Laura Onita and Eleanor Olcott.\n\nHe has now become \u201cthe most visible leader\u201d of Shein, according to one person who works with him.\n\nHis latest role as executive chair at Shein, valued at more than $60bn in a recent funding round, has propelled him on to the global stage. He faces the task of getting an IPO over the line in London after ditching earlier plans to list in New York in the face of US political opposition and scepticism around its vast supply chain.\n\nHe is \u201ccharismatic and intelligent\u201d and has \u201cbeen a powerful force in shaping the future of Shein\u201d, the person added, but his role is becoming more challenging as ties deteriorate between the US, Shein\u2019s main market, and China, where it was founded and most of its clothes are made.\n\nSome executives at the company have begun to question whether Tang is the right person for the job, according to one Shein insider, especially after a faux pas in May at the Milken Institute conference in Los Angeles where he said Shein, now headquartered in Singapore, was essentially an \u201cAmerican company\u201d.\n\nThe remarks received a cold reception in China, where they were taken as a sign that Shein was trying to \u201cde-Chinafy\u201d itself ahead of an IPO.\n\nChina\u2019s CATL is the world\u2019s biggest producer of electric vehicle batteries and had the equivalent of about $40bn of cash on its balance sheet as of March.\n\nAnd yet the company, a Tesla supplier, has been knocking on the doors of sovereign wealth funds and the world\u2019s super-rich to raise a comparatively measly $1.5bn fund.\n\nIt wants to bankroll an ecosystem of suppliers in Europe and other foreign markets, as it expands production outside China. But the country\u2019s strict system of capital controls means it could be arduous and time-consuming to invest directly in foreign companies.\n\nThat\u2019s where Hong Kong-based asset manager Lochpine Capital comes in, DD\u2019s Kaye Wiggins and FT colleagues report in this scoop. A filing dated August 2023 said Lochpine is owned by British Virgin Islands-based CATL Capital Investment. Lochpine was named CATL Capital until May.\n\nLochpine would manage the $1.5bn fund, to which CATL plans to contribute about 15 per cent. It had approached Mercedes-Benz and the family behind another luxury car company about investing in the fund, a person with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nThe battery maker has \u201ca big gap in supply\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and it\u2019s a good investment return\u201d, the person said, describing it as \u201ca market solution to [the] problem\u201d of not having sufficient suppliers in Europe and it being difficult to bankroll new ones directly.\n\nIt is doing so at a time when Brussels is planning tariffs for electric vehicles imported from China, a move analysts said would encourage more local manufacturing by Chinese carmakers.\n\nBut CATL has found itself in the crosshairs of US politicians as geopolitical tensions rise. Lawmakers including Republican senator Marco Rubio alleged last year that the battery maker was close to the Chinese leadership.\n\nIn March, CATL\u2019s founder and chief executive Robin Zeng told the FT it was \u201clike a joke\u201d to suggest batteries presented a security risk. \u201cBatteries are like rocks or bricks, you buy them to build a house\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009how can bricks spy?\u201d\n\nSqueezed out The world of private credit is becoming a difficult place for small players, as funds with less than $1bn of assets received the least amount of cash on record last year, Bloomberg reports.\n\nEquity draught Thames Water\u2019s all-out crisis has shown that the future of the UK water sector \u2014 which is in need of transparency over corporate governance, accounting and performance \u2014 should be listed, writes Lex.\n\nThames Water faces break-up threat under new Ofwat measures (FT)\n\nFrance\u2019s football league in last-ditch talks over TV deal (FT)\n\nVivendi explores London listing for streaming service Canal+ (FT)\n\nWall Street groups to buy software maker Envestnet for $4.5bn (FT)\n\nLi Ka-shing\u2019s CK Infrastructure considers secondary listing in London (FT)\n\nDaily Mail owner hits out at law change after admitting Telegraph defeat (FT)\n\nAllen & Overy partner pay reached \u00a32.2mn before blockbuster merger (FT)\n\nOasis takes larger bite of sandwich maker Greencore (FT)", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a99775d5-2715-4ac3-b16e-71286cb31ea6"}}, {"id": "e41f3e2e-df4d-4824-aa3a-64d283dcc9a6", "event_name": "Ambani\u2019s big rich Indian wedding brings global elite to Mumbai", "blurb": "Financial capital set to descend into gridlock during marriage festivities for son of billionaire industrialist", "date": "2024-07-1100:00:00.0", "body": "A pantheon of global celebrities, politicians and business leaders are descending on India\u2019s financial capital for the wedding of the youngest son of Mukesh Ambani, Asia\u2019s richest man, in a testament to the wealth and power of the country\u2019s elite.\n\nAnant Ambani\u2019s marriage to Radhika Merchant, daughter of a healthcare billionaire, is being celebrated this weekend at the Ambani-owned Jio World Convention Centre in the Bandra Kurla Complex, an upscale district moulded by India\u2019s leading corporate clan, boasting glitzy shopping malls and a prominent arts venue.\n\nThe celebration is the culmination of months of wedding events, which have offered a showcase of India\u2019s growing clout on the global stage, led by the wealth, power and influence of tycoons such as Ambani, chair of Reliance Industries, an oil refining, telecoms and retail behemoth.\n\n\u201cThe Ambanis are playing the game of the super-rich in India, trying to out-do and one-up the over-the-top celebrations of other super-elites,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. This extravaganza was also \u201ca sobering reminder of India\u2019s soaring economic inequalities\u201d, he added.\n\nThe festivities opened in March with a three-day prenuptial party near Reliance\u2019s Jamnagar petrochemical complex in Gujarat, where attendees including Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Ivanka Trump and Larry Fink were treated to a live performance by Rihanna.\n\nEarlier this week, Justin Bieber landed in Mumbai to perform at the couple\u2019s sangeet, or musical ceremony, where guests mingled with Indian film and cricket stars.\n\nAntilia, the Ambanis\u2019 towering Mumbai home, has hummed with activity. Indian musicians performed outside, while the adjacent street was draped with golden lights. Videos released to the media showed the Ambanis performing Bollywood numbers, with Mukesh pretending to drive an open-topped classic car, lip-syncing with his wife Nita to a song from a 1968 Hindi film as they cuddled their grandchildren.\n\nLocal media has speculated about the star-studded guest list, suggesting the opulent affair could be attended by figures including former UK prime ministers Boris Johnson and Sir Tony Blair, HSBC chair Sir Mark Tucker, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, boxer Mike Tyson and the Kardashians. The Ambani family has not confirmed the guest list.\n\nWhile the family has also held multiple charitable events, including personally serving food to villagers, the final gala in Mumbai has elicited frustration from residents of the congested megacity. Police have imposed traffic diversions from Friday to Monday around the Jio centre to handle the large influx of VIPs for an unnamed \u201cpublic event\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt will be madness for the next three or four days,\u201d said a person involved in planning the nuptials.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taken over the entire place\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the venue is owned by them, the area is pretty much owned by them, so nothing can move in that place,\u201d said one businessman exasperated at the months-long celebrations, who preferred to remain anonymous. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nA pre-wedding Mediterranean \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d cruise hosted by the Ambanis in May also drew complaints from locals in Italy over loud noise and the closure of coastal areas in Portofino. The cruise included performances by Andrea Bocelli, Katy Perry and the Backstreet Boys.\n\nCanadian DJ deadmau5, known for performing in an oversized mouse helmet, was also forced to cancel a Friday concert in Mumbai at short notice ahead of a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is expected to attend the wedding and inaugurate infrastructure projects.\n\nModi\u2019s presence, which in the past has caused gridlock in Mumbai, meant \u201cthe planned venue is no longer available for use as per directives issued by the relevant authorities\u201d, the gig\u2019s organisers said in a statement. Representatives for deadmau5 did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s anticipated attendance was also reminder of the close political connections Reliance has forged over the decades since it was founded by Mukesh\u2019s father Dhirubhai Ambani. The family hails from the prime minister's home state of Gujarat, as does fellow tycoon Gautam Adani.\n\nReliance did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe extravagant celebration also comes as the conglomerate prepares for a third-generation leadership succession, following a bitter battle between Mukesh Ambani and his younger brother Anil after their father died without a will.\n\nReliance\u2019s three main business units have been divided among Mukesh's children, and last year the trio were elevated to the group\u2019s board.\n\nKugelman said the wedding \u201chelps to give Anant some added publicity, to show that he\u2019s ready for primetime\u201d.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nAmbani wedding frenzy signals India is among elite\u00a0/\u00a0From Rajiv Radhakrishnan, London NW8, UK", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/60c10847-1915-479f-903d-ec4543997ee8"}}, {"id": "90fea572-8024-41cb-92fa-c7999a6bb5c5", "event_name": "India warns UK not to impose deadline on trade talks ", "blurb": "Two sides are \u2018on board\u2019 on important details, says commerce minister ", "date": "2024-07-1100:00:00.0", "body": "India is optimistic about striking a long-awaited trade deal with the UK\u2019s new Labour government, though warned Britain not to place \u201ca gun [to] our head\u201d by imposing a deadline on the renewed talks, the country\u2019s commerce minister said.\n\nPiyush Goyal told the Financial Times that past discussions showed the two sides were \u201cpretty much on board on most of the issues we have discussed\u201d, and that a deal may \u201cclose very quickly\u201d.\n\nBut he urged the UK not to repeat a mistake made by Boris Johnson when the then-prime minister promised in early 2022 that a trade agreement could be finalised within six months.\n\n\u201cIndia does not believe any [free trade agreement] should have a deadline for negotiations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never discuss any FTA with any country or group of countries with a gun [to] our head.\u201d\n\nTalks between the countries have been under way since January 2022.\n\nIn a call with Narendra Modi following the Labour party\u2019s election win last week, Sir Keir Starmer told India\u2019s prime minister \u2014 who was himself re-elected last month \u2014 that he \u201cstood ready to conclude a deal that worked for both sides\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on the day of the UK\u2019s election, Goyal said he had secured commitments from Labour before the election that if they won they would continue negotiations, but warned that talks would not be rushed and any deal had to be \u201cequitable, fair and balanced\u201d.\n\nGoyal said the deal was \u201csomething which is ready to be closed very quickly, but that it could take very long also\u201d.\n\nLabour won a historic majority in the election last week, securing 411 seats while the Conservatives tumbled to their worst ever election result of 121 seats.\n\nJonathan Reynolds, Labour\u2019s newly appointed business and trade secretary, visited India earlier this year in his shadow role, and the party pledged in its manifesto to seek \u201ca new strategic partnership with India, including a free trade agreement\u201d.\n\nThe next round of formal negotiations is set to begin this month, according to local media reports.\n\nThe UK has sought lower Indian tariffs on British exports such as whisky and cars, as well as a relaxation of rules restricting its financial and professional services firms from operating in India.\n\nNew Delhi wants market access for goods such as textiles, as well as better terms for citizens to work and study in the UK.\n\nIt has also insisted that any agreement giving greater access for UK businesses must reflect the enormous growth opportunities in the world\u2019s most populous country, whose economy is expected to expand more than 7 per cent this year.\n\nGoyal said: \u201cPersonally, if you ask me, in the FTA I don\u2019t find any big issue left, except that we have opened up very significantly on the services side, contingent to certain commitments that we expect from the UK.\u201d\n\nAny deal needs \u201ca fair balance, given our different size of population, given our different aspiration levels, given our different growth projections\u201d, he added.\n\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party was elected for a third consecutive term last month, albeit with a weakened mandate after losing its majority and being forced into a coalition government.\n\nGoyal called the Indian result a \u201cbig victory\u201d for the BJP and said the government had \u201ccome back with a renewed vision and passion to do much more\u201d.

Indian government officials, who had hosted Tesla executives on past visits and prepared about 20 visas for the delegation due in April, were left waiting.\n\nThe abrupt change of plan sparked speculation in India, where an expected Tesla investment was seen as a coup for Modi. Confusion about Musk\u2019s commitment to the country increased when he met Premier Li Qiang in China, which India views as a geopolitical rival.\n\nEmployees close to Musk had persuaded him to call off his trip \u2014 despite the potential consequences of snubbing Modi as India\u2019s election was getting under way \u2014 because of an unmissable opportunity in China, said people with knowledge of the discussions. During his Beijing trip, Musk sealed a deal that moved him closer to his goal of bringing full self-driving technology to China, the world\u2019s largest car market.\n\nTesla remained committed to a plant in India in the long term, said people with direct knowledge of the matter, adding that Musk was \u201cobsessed\u201d with the country for its potential as a market and as a hub to build cars for export.\n\n\u201cMusk wants to be everywhere, and that\u2019s how he operates, so he needs both China and India,\u201d said one person close to Tesla\u2019s India plans. \u201cWhile some egos may have been hurt when Musk cancelled the trip, as a country, India still needs Tesla to show that it is a great country to make investments in electric vehicles.\u201d\n\nOfficials in India, the world\u2019s third-largest car market, are nervously waiting to see whether Tesla will register for a scheme allowing lower tariffs on higher-priced imported EVs for companies that commit to making them in the country within three years \u2014 something Tesla has long sought. The scheme begins taking applications this month and would require the company to pledge an investment in India in exchange for lower duties.\n\nA Tesla plant would be a marquee investment by a US company in India\u2019s under-developed EV sector, an industry that rival China currently dominates.\n\nSince the cancelled visit, local officials have not held discussions on the tariffs with Tesla, two people familiar with the matter said, although the complex scheme has not received much interest from other foreign carmakers either.\n\nAny expansion into India would entail significant risks for Tesla at a time when EV sales are slowing globally. Carmakers from Ford and General Motors to Toyota have struggled in a crowded market where local brands are battling to fend off foreign manufacturers. Tesla itself is undergoing upheaval, with deep job cuts and a strategic pivot towards autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to people with knowledge of the situation, Musk\u2019s interest became serious around 2019 despite his refusal to produce cars locally at the time. Efforts to expand in India were led by Tesla\u2019s global head of policy and business development Rohan Patel, a former energy adviser to President Barack Obama, who hired about a dozen people to negotiate with Indian officials.\n\nBy 2022, Musk had become increasingly confident about the prospects of building EVs in India. When he met Modi in New York in 2023, he said Tesla would try to be in India \u201cas soon as humanly possible\u201d. Executives paid several visits to the country, with commerce minister Piyush Goyal serving as the Modi government\u2019s main liaison.\n\nPeople briefed on Tesla\u2019s plans for India said it was looking at investing $2bn-$3bn over three years. The proposed plant would have a target capacity of as many as 500,000 cars a year, most of which would be exported. Tesla also discussed investing in its own battery facility.\n\nThe talks accelerated after New Delhi announced its scheme for lower tariffs on higher-priced imported EVs. At around the same time, the company began making right-hand drive vehicles at its factory near Berlin, intended for export to India.\n\nBut behind the scenes, obstacles to a big India announcement were emerging.\n\nNews landed that Tesla might get a breakthrough agreement in China regarding deployment of its full self-driving system. One person with knowledge of the discussions said Musk was worried about embarrassing Modi by cancelling his trip but was told by his team to focus on China \u2014 and called off the visit.\n\nDays before cancelling his India trip, Musk had also sent out an internal memo disclosing that more than 10 per cent of Tesla\u2019s staff would be laid off, including the division that runs its industry-leading \u201cSupercharger\u201d network and the company\u2019s entire public policy unit.\u00a0There was internal opposition to announcing an investment in India at a time of swingeing job and cost cuts in the company, two of the people said.\n\nPatel was among those let go, leaving Indian government officials blindsided when Musk made his surprise appearance in Beijing. Since then, officials have struggled to find counterparts at Tesla to discuss its plans in India.\n\nSome Indian officials have speculated that Musk was reacting to delays in regulatory approval for his Starlink satellite business to operate in India, where the space-based telecoms business is taking off. However, another person close to the matter said issues at Starlink did not affect Musk\u2019s decision to call off the trip.\n\nTesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk\u2019s gamble to prioritise China \u2014 the world\u2019s largest EV market with 60 per cent of all sales \u2014 appears to have paid off. Tesla is reportedly already trialling its full self-driving technology in Shanghai after signing a lane-level mapping and navigation contract with Baidu \u2014 a deal that was unlocked by his visit. Also this month, Tesla became the first foreign-owned carmaker to be included on a Chinese local government\u2019s list of electric vehicles that can be bought by public, party and government groups.\n\nIn the short term, any additional sales are crucial for Tesla, which is facing a downturn in deliveries as its top-selling Model Y and Model 3 vehicles approach saturation point in the US market.\n\nLonger term, getting full self-driving approval in China and \u201csolving autonomy\u201d for cars is critical for Musk\u2019s strategy to run a fleet of hundreds of millions of robotaxis and reposition Tesla as a leader in AI.\n\nDespite the snub during a tight election campaign, Modi still appears open to another visit from Musk, with the pair exchanging messages on X after the prime minister\u2019s victory last month.\n\nIn New Delhi, several officials expressed confidence that Tesla had not lost interest in the market. One official said: \u201cThe general drift is they will be coming sooner or later.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Benjamin Parkin and Jyotsna Singh in New Delhi", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8266a1a5-a785-4ad8-bfa1-d6a606704f3a"}}, {"id": "abcfec14-8fdf-4a41-a69b-c5c37462bac7", "event_name": "Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin to boost trade despite Ukraine war", "blurb": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls Indian PM\u2019s trip to Russia a \u2018devastating blow to peace efforts\u2019", "date": "2024-07-0900:00:00.0", "body": "India\u2019s Narendra Modi and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin have agreed to boost trade between their two countries, defying western efforts to squeeze the Russian economy over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring Modi\u2019s visit to Moscow on Monday and Tuesday, he and Putin pledged to increase annual bilateral trade to $100bn by 2030, up from $65bn at present, with India importing more Russian oil and fertilisers and seeking to export more agricultural and industrial products.\n\nModi \u2014 who is seeking to counter Russia\u2019s increasingly close ties to India\u2019s strategic rival China \u2014 hailed Russia as India\u2019s \u201call-weather friend\u201d during his visit and was presented by Putin with the country\u2019s highest civilian honour, the Order of St Andrew.\n\nSergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters Putin and Modi had laid a \u201cfantastic foundation\u201d to deepen their economic, political and defence ties during the talks, according to Interfax.\n\nThe Kremlin, which has sought to rally countries such as India behind Putin\u2019s vision of a Moscow-led \u201cglobal majority\u201d to challenge US hegemony, has hailed the trip as a sign Ukraine\u2019s western supporters have failed to isolate Russia or generate support for Kyiv in developing countries.\n\nPutin thanked Modi for what he described as the Indian premier\u2019s efforts to \u201cfind a way to solve the Ukrainian crisis, through peaceful means foremost\u201d during a five-hour conversation at the Russian president\u2019s residence.\n\nIndia has not condemned the invasion or taken sides in the war, but has called for an end to hostilities while offering Moscow a critical lifeline from western sanctions by ramping up discounted purchases of Russian oil. New Delhi has a decades-long relationship with Russia, its largest arms supplier.\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticised Modi for the visit, calling it \u201ca huge disappointment\u201d. Zelenskyy described it on X as \u201ca devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow\u201d.\n\nModi\u2019s visit, his first to Russia since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, came as a Russian barrage on Monday struck a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv and other targets, killing at least 38 people, including four children, and injuring 190 others.\n\nModi expressed sadness about Monday\u2019s victims and called for \u201cdialogue and diplomacy\u201d to resolve the conflict. \u201cWhen innocent children die, the heart breaks and that pain is horrific,\u201d he said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said western countries were \u201cjealous\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and with good reason\u201d that Modi had chosen Russia for his first bilateral visit after India\u2019s election last month, in which Modi won a third five-year term.\n\nIndia\u2019s ties to Russia have become particularly important for New Delhi as western sanctions designed to isolate Russia have pushed Moscow closer to China. Beijing has provided Moscow with an economic lifeline, increasing bilateral trade to record levels and becoming a critical supplier to Russia of western-manufactured components with potential battlefield uses.\n\n\u201cIndia wants to give Russia room for manoeuvre,\u201d said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin. \u201cThey might not have the levers to pull Russia away from China, but they want to give it as many opportunities as they can to stop them from putting all their eggs in the Chinese basket.\u201d\n\nIndia is engaged in a stand-off with China along their disputed Himalayan border, and sees Russia\u2019s neutrality as vital to national security, officials said. \u201cChina is the primary challenge,\u201d said Pankaj Saran, a former Indian ambassador to Russia. \u201cWe really cannot afford to do anything which converts a friend into an adversary.\u201d\n\nTrade between India and Russia has soared since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion, largely due to a sharp increase in purchases of discounted oil. Russian crude accounted for 43 per cent of India\u2019s oil imports in June, according to data provider Vortexa, making it the second-biggest buyer after China.\n\nThis has led to a sharp trade imbalance. Indian foreign secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters that economic issues had \u201cdominated\u201d discussions between the leaders and that Modi told Putin of \u201cthe need to broad-base the trade basket\u201d. Kwatra said Russia had also told India it would ensure the early discharge of the dozens of Indian nationals unwittingly conscripted into the Russian army to fight in Ukraine.\n\nWestern sanctions have complicated Moscow\u2019s ability to repatriate dollar revenues from its oil sales to India. A US crackdown has driven banks to sharply cut back on Russian counterparties, limiting their access to certain currencies and forcing traders to conduct transactions in roubles or even bartering for goods, according to financiers involved in the trade.\n\nThe US and EU have also stepped up efforts to target the fleet shipping Russia\u2019s oil, leaving buyers such as India vulnerable to possible future sanctions.\n\n\u201cGlobal banks will be hesitant to touch any transactions that may expose them to enforcement action by the US,\u201d said Benjamin Hilgenstock at the Kyiv School of Economics Institute. \u201cAn expanded tanker designation campaign could become a problem for Indian buyers.\u201d\n\nIndia and Russia are attempting to promote domestic payment systems for trade, but doing so at scale will be difficult because of limited capacity, as well as the challenge of exchanging roubles and rupees for dollars and euros, he added. Maxim Oreshkin, Putin\u2019s economic adviser, claimed India and Russia were already conducting 70 per cent of their trade in their national currencies, according to Interfax.\n\nSome analysts said Modi\u2019s visit obscured the fact that India was increasingly staking its future on economic and military co-operation with the west.\n\nRussia\u2019s share of Indian arms imports fell to a near 60-year low between 2019 and 2023, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, as India sought more sophisticated military technology from countries including the US and Israel.\n\nMoscow\u2019s growing dependence on Chinese supplies for its arms industry created another concern for India and its weapons procurement plans, the Carnegie Center\u2019s Gabuev said, because of concerns that Moscow cannot service weapons systems or sell new arms without component supplies from China.\n\n\u201cThe substantial part of the [India-Russia] relationship is on a very fragile basis,\u201d said Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, South Asia head at the Eurasia Group consultancy. \u201cI would argue that this is a managed decline.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Christopher Miller in Lviv and Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/d70e7367-0113-49c4-81be-0c5c3edcbffe"}}, {"id": "ec255137-1e84-4ab3-aa28-9522e034708f", "event_name": "Why India will become a superpower", "blurb": "The nation can play a big part in shaping the world\u2019s future but its internal challenges are formidable", "date": "2024-07-0900:00:00.0", "body": "\u201cI have an unwavering belief that in 2047, when the country celebrates 100 years of independence, my country will be a developed India.\u201d\n\nThus did Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, address his country on Independence Day 2023. Is his aspiration a feasible one? Yes. Is it a plausible one? No. But it is still likely that India will be a superpower by that time, with an economy, on one measure, as large as that of the US. So, how might India get there? What challenges will it face? What might it mean for the world?\n\nI addressed the topic of India\u2019s economic future in lectures last week at the National Council of Applied Economic Research and the Consumer Unity and Trust Society in New Delhi. I illustrated the challenge of becoming a high-income country by comparing India with the poorest country ranked as \u201cadvanced\u201d by the IMF, Greece. In 2023, India\u2019s GDP per head at purchasing power parity (PPP) was just under a quarter of that of Greece. If Greek GDP per head grows at a mere 0.6 per cent (its 1990-2029 trend, with IMF forecasts) and India\u2019s grows at 4.8 per cent (its 1990-2029 trend), India\u2019s GDP per head would only be 60 per cent of Greece\u2019s in 2047. If its GDP per head were to match that of Greece by 2047, the rate of growth in GDP per head would need to rise to 7.5 per cent a year. That rate of growth would not be far below that of China from 1990 to 2012, when it achieved the astounding annual rate of 9 per cent. (See charts.)\n\nThe picture of aggregate size is rather different. UN forecasts indicate that by 2050, India\u2019s population will be 1.67bn, against 1.32bn in China and 380mn in the US. With more than four times the population, it will not be hard for India to match total US economic output. Indeed, if India\u2019s GDP were to grow at only 5 per cent a year to 2047 (well below its 1990-2029 trend annual rate of 6.3 per cent), and US GDP were to grow at 2.3 per cent (its 1990-2029 trend rate, on a similar basis), India\u2019s economy (at PPP) would equal that of the US.\n\nThe US would still be more technologically advanced and have far higher productivity. India\u2019s manufacturing prowess is also unlikely ever to match that of China: the share of its industrial sector in GDP is not only far smaller than China\u2019s, but is already in decline. Yet size matters: with its huge population and a big economy, India would be a superpower, not fully matching China or the US, but unquestionably a great power.\n\nWhat might prevent this from happening? One reason might be the slowdown in global economic growth noted in the IMF\u2019s April 2024 World Economic Outlook. The impact and extent of this structural slowdown (with China\u2019s deceleration and demographic change elements in the picture) could be worsened by a big jump in protectionism triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s possible re-election. In the longer term, the climate crisis might affect economic growth, as well as human welfare more broadly, as I argued last week. Also far from unimaginable is war among the superpowers. Against this, some hope artificial intelligence will reignite economic growth. But that is questionable.\n\nA crucial point is that Indians will need their economy to grow at least twice as fast as global output. This means that its exports will also have to grow at least twice as fast as global output if the trade ratio is not to fall: otherwise, the economy would become ever more closed.\n\nIn a recent paper, Shoumitro Chatterjee and Arvind Subramanian argue against any renewed bout of aversion to trade. They note the widespread belief that \u201cIndia is a large country with a large market\u201d. But the true market size for tradeable goods and services is somewhere between 15 and 45 per cent of GDP, given the widespread poverty.\n\nAgain, some argue that \u201cexports have not been important for Indian growth\u201d. But exports have in fact been crucial, not least because they pay for necessary imports, increase competition and offer access to global knowhow. Finally, people argue that \u201cglobal opportunities are disappearing\u201d. But India\u2019s share in world merchandise exports (excluding intra-EU trade) was a mere 2.2 per cent in 2022, against China\u2019s 17.6 per cent. Even its exports of commercial services were only 4.4 per cent of the world total, far below the US share of 12.8 per cent and China\u2019s 6 per cent.\n\nMoreover, and crucially, India has strengths. It is an obvious \u201cplus one\u201d in a world of \u201cChina plus one\u201d. India has good relations with the west, to which it is strategically important. But it is also important enough to matter to everybody else. It could be what the IMF calls a \u201cconnector country\u201d in the world economy. Indeed, it can and should lead in the liberalisation of trade, domestically and globally. India also has the advantage of its diaspora, which is enormously influential, especially in the US. Not least, India\u2019s human resources give it the capacity to diversify and upgrade the economy over time. It must exploit this. Size, in short, gives the country weight. India is not just constrained by the world: it can and must shape it.\n\nWhat will matter most, however,\u00a0is how India manages itself. Its biggest challenges are internal: maintaining stability; improving education; defending the rule of law; upgrading infrastructure; providing a first-class environment for investment; encouraging inward investment; and accelerating its shift towards clean energy.\n\nThe recent elections have made me more optimistic. The country should continue to have a stable government. But Modi\u2019s BJP has been humbled.\u00a0I hope this will persuade the government to focus its efforts on the economy and welfare of the population, rather than on India\u2019s very own culture wars. India can be an influential and immensely important stabilising force in the world. We must all hope it rises to this occasion.\n\nmartin.wolf@ft.com\n\nFollow Martin Wolf with\u00a0myFT and on\u00a0X", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7ebec65b-79fb-4366-8d55-bc817c8606ac"}}, {"id": "facd3503-d14e-492e-98fc-915dc868a031", "event_name": "Low valuations for clean energy groups are hampering green transition, says ReNew boss", "blurb": "Chief executive of Nasdaq-listed Indian renewables group says companies are mispriced as they struggle to raise cash", "date": "2024-07-0900:00:00.0", "body": "Public markets are undervaluing clean energy companies and hampering the green transition, the chief executive of one of India\u2019s largest renewable energy groups has said, as the sector struggles to entice investors.\n\nSumant Sinha, head of ReNew Energy Global, also raised the prospect of moving its listing from the Nasdaq as concerns over a potential Donald Trump presidency in the US and high interest rates have helped spur a clean energy sell-off.\n\nThe lower valuations have prompted some buyout groups to swoop, lured by what they see as bargains in the renewable energy sector.

The tools are aimed at fast-growing Indian industries, such as the country\u2019s large customer service and call centre sector.\n\nIndia has 22 official languages, with Hindi the most widespread, but researchers estimate the languages and dialects spoken by its 1.4bn people rise into the thousands. Google on Tuesday launched its Gemini AI assistant in nine Indian languages.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Copilot AI assistant is available in 12 Indian languages, and the company is working on other projects tailored for India, including building \u201ctiny\u201d language models at its Bengaluru-based research centre. These smaller alternatives to the expensive large language models underpinning generative AI can run on smartphones rather than the cloud, making them cheaper and potentially better suited to countries such as India where connectivity can be limited.\n\nMicrosoft wants to \u201cmake [AI] simple and easy to use and get it to the hands of all these customers and partners\u201d, Puneet Chandok, president of Microsoft for India and south Asia, told the Financial Times. He added that this involved \u201ccontextualising it for the Indian context, making it more relevant, more precise\u201d.\n\nMicrosoft is also partnering with Sarvam AI. The Bengaluru-based company founded only last year is developing a \u201cfull stack\u201d of generative AI tools for Indian businesses. The start-up has raised $41mn from investors including Peak XV, Sequoia\u2019s former India arm, and Menlo Park-based Lightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nLightspeed partner Hemant Mohapatra said investing in local AI companies was becoming more important as governments seek to develop \u201csovereign AI\u201d that is trained and stored within their borders.\n\n\u201cThe AI supply chain is beginning to fragment,\u201d said Mohapatra. \u201cIf you\u2019re training a foundation model in India on Indian citizen data, audio, video, text, different languages, then it has to be an Indian company, focused on Indian use cases, Indian-domiciled, Indian founders and so on.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s AI race does not involve building LLMs from scratch to compete with leaders such as Open AI. Investors argue the resources and capital required would be too much to make sense.\n\nInstead, companies such as Sarvam AI are focusing on adapting existing LLMs for Indian languages and using voice data instead of text. This makes them more effective in a country where many prefer to communicate through audio messages rather than in writing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a massive gap between these underlying models and real-world use cases in countries as complex as India,\u201d said Lightspeed partner Bejul Somaia. \u201cIn a market like India, you\u2019re going to need to have a little bit of an ecosystem that springs up to enable companies to use the underlying model capabilities.\u201d\n\nTanuja Ganu, a manager at Microsoft Research in Bengaluru, said an additional benefit of testing new technologies and tools in a country of India\u2019s size and diversity was that they could be exported elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s using India as a test bed and validating some of the technology in India and seeing how we can expand it to other parts of the world,\u201d she said.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0acc6e82-bf34-4122-91b5-15cd50c4ddd8"}}, {"id": "7d4da1d7-d568-4f82-aab6-0c4fa4403820", "event_name": "EU\u2019s carbon border tax plans trigger alarm in India", "blurb": "Fast-growing heavy industry fears big hit from Brussels\u2019 plans to put levies on emission-intensive imports", "date": "2024-06-2100:00:00.0", "body": "The EU\u2019s planned carbon border tax has triggered alarm in India as the country\u2019s fast-growing heavy industries race to respond to a measure they fear could wipe out one of their biggest markets.\n\nSteel, aluminium and other industrial metal producers have grown rapidly in India as the economy has expanded, becoming competitive suppliers to countries around the world, including across Europe.\n\nYet this production overwhelmingly depends on coal \u2014 still the main fuel source in the world\u2019s most populous country, as efforts to green the economy struggle to keep up with rapid economic growth. India\u2019s coal demand is unlikely to peak until the next decade, according to officials.\n\nThis leaves the industry highly vulnerable to the EU\u2019s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), the world\u2019s first attempt to tax carbon\u00adintensive imports such as steel, iron and fertilisers. It is due to come into force in 2026.\n\nIndian authorities and companies fear the measure could lead to double-digit duties on their products and leave them unable to compete with both Europe-based suppliers and cheaper rivals, such as China. The UK also plans to introduce its own CBAM from 2027.\n\nGopal Nadadur, vice-president for South Asia at business consultancy The Asia Group, warns the measures could put Indian companies at a severe disadvantage if they do not adapt in time. \u201cThese industries are highly commoditised with low margins,\u201d he says. \u201cYou already have Chinese supply, not to mention other supply, breathing down your neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe argument is that it\u2019s unfair,\u201d Nadadur explains. \u201cIndia is saying \u2018We\u2019ve already committed to the Paris Accords [climate treaty from 2015], and are taking steps to get there\u2019.\u201d But he thinks CBAM could \u201chasten the pace or cause policymakers to think about hastening the pace\u201d of their green transitions.\n\nPiyush Goyal, India\u2019s commerce minister, is a supporter of this argument \u2014 telling the Financial Times earlier this year that the EU\u2019s carbon border tax was an example of \u201cbias, discrimination and unfairness\u201d, and threatening to challenge it at the WTO. Around a quarter of India\u2019s $31bn exports of steel, iron and cement in 2022 went to the EU, according to the India-based Global Trade Research Initiative.\n\nNew Delhi is now seeking to shield industry from the brunt of these carbon border taxes, by seeking carve outs for Indian companies as part of free trade agreement negotiations with both the EU and UK, according to media reports.\n\n\u201cCBAM is going to act like a non-tariff measure,\u201d says Biswajit Dhar, a trade professor at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade. \u201cIndian companies are still lagging behind in terms of their emission standards\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Indian industry is really going to suffer.\u201d\n\nCritics argue that the CBAM amounts to an attempt by developed nations, that first became wealthy by freely burning fossil fuels, to penalise developing countries that are juggling growth with a need to green their economies at the same time.\n\nThey argue that unilateral measures like these disregard the decarbonisation commitments made at climate summits such as COP \u2014 including India\u2019s pledge three years ago to reach net zero by 2070 \u2014 and undermine efforts to find globally negotiated solutions to the crisis.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a concern that the principles are different,\u201d says Seema Arora, deputy director-general at the Confederation of Indian Industry, a leading trade association. \u201cThis is not reflecting any of those well-agreed-to principles in the global negotiations and global discourse on climate that has been happening over a period of time.\u201d\n\nBut, despite the outrage, Indian authorities and companies are also moving quickly to make their own heavy industries greener as they recognise that \u2014 with or without carbon border taxes \u2014 improving their own sustainability is crucial to remaining competitive.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of installing 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030, of which about 150GW has already been built.\n\nIndia has also introduced multibillion-dollar subsidies to try to kick-start a domestic manufacturing industry for green hydrogen \u2014 made by using renewable energy to electrolyse water so there are no emissions \u2014 to replace coal as a power source for carbon-intensive heavy industries, such as steelmaking.\n\nSome of India\u2019s largest industrial conglomerates are better placed. Groups such as JSW and Tata Steel already have facilities in Europe, and the latter \u2014 part of the country\u2019s large Tata conglomerate \u2014 has previously expressed support for CBAM. JSW has said that it plans to establish a \u201cgreen\u201d manufacturing facility in western India by 2030 in order to supply steel to the EU.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, though, many small and medium-sized businesses in heavy industry supply chains are at more risk of being caught unprepared.\n\n\u201cA lot of MSMEs [micro, small and medium enterprises] don\u2019t even monitor their carbon emissions,\u201d says Arora of the CII. Part of the challenge is \u201cto make them aware of what these challenges are all about\u201d, she argues. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to ascertain what is the impact on trade, how it will impact trade in terms of the increase in cost.\u201d\n\nDhar, however, believes that, for CBAM to truly make a difference in greening Indian industry, it would require more domestic acceptance. When policies are \u201cimposed from the outside, then there\u2019s a knee-jerk reaction\u201d, he warns. \u201cIf it\u2019s to be adopted honestly, there has to be buy-in from the inside.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6f324116-2707-440d-8808-c98749f8bc87"}}, {"id": "593d9dfd-6e9f-47f9-a2f4-9943d014e53b", "event_name": "Will Modi 3.0 be good for business?

His praise echoed the adulation India\u2019s billionaires routinely lavish on the prime minister at official events.\n\nBut Dimon spoke before this month\u2019s election upset in India, in which voters aggrieved with some Modi policies, including his government\u2019s record on creating jobs, re-elected his Bharatiya Janata party for a third term but stripped it of its majority for the first time since 2014.\n\nBusinesspeople are now trying to assess what a weakened Modi \u2014 more beholden than before to his coalition partners and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Hindu nationalist organisation behind the BJP \u2014 might mean for investment, jobs and growth.\n\n\u201cWith an emboldened opposition and a weakened Modi, India\u2019s politics is likelier to get noisier and more contentious, and business will now have to consider political and regulatory risks in a way that they have not had to do over the past 10 years,\u201d says Khalid Shah, analyst with Control Risks. \u201cWhile his cabinet appointments signal broad policy continuity, many of the government\u2019s major business-friendly moves, such as land and labour reforms, may now be put on the back burner.\u201d\n\nDuring a decade in power, Modi\u2019s governments have stabilised India\u2019s once-wobbly macroeconomy, moved hundreds of millions of people into the digital economy, and made a dent in long-needed tax and other reforms. But India still faces deep structural challenges around education and agriculture. In 2021, Modi was forced by mass protests to abandon planned farming reforms.\n\nBefore the election upset, government officials had said that with a bigger majority they could move forward with reforms needed to make India a manufacturing economy, including a more flexible labour code and legislation making it easier to buy land.\n\nAfterwards, Modi was quick to signal that it was business as usual when he named a new cabinet largely unchanged from the last one. Analysts also expect the new government to pick up where the old one left off, probably drawing up a new round of production-linked incentives (subsidies for export-focused manufacturing industries) and building on Modi\u2019s \u201cDeveloped India\u201d goal of making the country a developed economy by 2047.\n\nHowever, opposition parties would have greater representation now and feel more empowered to thwart Modi, analysts said, both in parliament and possibly in new street protests.\n\nIn addition to a more forceful opposition, Modi could face more pushback from within his own political camp, including from the RSS, which has economic views that are less market-friendly than Modi\u2019s own.\u00a0The RSS is sceptical about India opening up its defence sector, for example, and of free trade agreements such as the one New Delhi has been negotiating for more than two years with the UK.\n\n\u201cNow he will face the normal thing a normal politician will face in a democracy: criticism,\u201d says Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, south Asia practice head with Eurasia Group. \u201cThe sense is that he is no longer as politically invincible as before.\u201d\n\nThe newly sworn-in ministers are mostly quiet for now. But one indication of the direction of Modi 3.0\u2019s programme for business will come when a new budget is unveiled next month. Another will come with the prime minister\u2019s August 15 independence day speech, when he typically makes grand economic pledges, like his Viksit Bharat (Developed India) declaration last year.\n\nFor now, the mood music from business remains publicly upbeat.

But Indian political analysts have raised questions about the stability of his coalition, which will be the weakest in a decade, forcing the BJP to rely on smaller allied parties to maintain power.\n\nThe election result saw the opposition INDIA alliance, led by Gandhi\u2019s Indian National Congress party, perform far better than forecast, winning 234 of 543 seats in India\u2019s lower house to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance\u2019s 293.

But the party and India\u2019s broader centre left has been widely seen as a waning force in recent years, with some critics asserting that the family\u2019s dominance of Congress was an obstacle to its progress.\n\nGandhi stepped down as the party\u2019s president after the BJP\u2019s decisive victory in elections in 2019 but has stayed active in its affairs and remains its most prominent face.\n\nCongress was an easy target for the populist BJP because of its dynastic heritage and endemic corruption in its past governments. Modi attacked Gandhi as a privileged \u201cshehzada\u201d, or prince, and Indian media outlets, many of which are owned by Modi backers or rely on them for advertising, often portrayed him as a feckless and blundering figure.\n\nHowever, analysts said the opposition MP took steps to rebuild his political brand with two yatras, or treks, across the country, first south to north by foot and then east to west by vehicle.\n\nThe images of Gandhi mingling with ordinary Indian citizens cut a contrast with Modi, who has cultivated a cult of personality unseen in Indian politics since Gandhi\u2019s grandmother Indira and during the campaign claimed he was sent by God.\n\n\u201cThe judicial system, the media, the institutional framework \u2014 all were shut [for the opposition], and so we decided we have to literally, physically go do it,\u201d Gandhi said. \u201cA lot of the ideas that succeeded in this election came from that walk \u2014 and they came not from us but from the people of India.\u201d\n\nWhile the BJP lost only about a percentage point of its vote share, Gandhi and his allies won critical seats in the Hindu nationalist party\u2019s northern heartland, including in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state.\n\nThese include the Faizabad constituency, where Modi presided at the consecration of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya on the site of a destroyed mosque to kick off his campaign.\n\nWhile Modi said in his victory speech that India\u2019s 1.4bn people had \u201creposed their faith\u201d in the BJP and National Democratic Alliance, Gandhi claimed the ruling party had been \u201cfatally wounded\u201d by the voters\u2019 verdict.\n\n\u201cThe idea of Mr Modi and the image of Mr Modi has been destroyed,\u201d Gandhi said. \u201cThe party that spent the last 10 years talking about Ayodhya has been wiped out in Ayodhya.\n\n\u201cEssentially what has happened is that the basic architecture of BJP \u2014 the idea of creating religious hatred \u2014 that has collapsed.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/b46e5f2e-c030-4cbf-b877-3acfdeb13842"}}, {"id": "5344b587-8ac2-45fa-997f-0c02a8360f02", "event_name": "India pulls in tech giants for its AI ambitions", "blurb": "Microsoft and Amazon among those splashing out to scale up infrastructure in world\u2019s most populous country ", "date": "2024-06-1700:00:00.0", "body": "India is pushing ambitions to become a leading artificial intelligence hub as Big Tech groups such as Microsoft and Amazon prepare to spend billions on computing infrastructure in the country in a race to dominate the burgeoning industry.\n\nAuthorities in India have offered incentives for tech companies to set up everything from electronics manufacturing to data storage.

Its previous record was 4.8mn metric tonnes of rice exports, valued at about $2.5bn in 2021-22.\n\nThe boom follows India\u2019s decision to impose export restrictions on certain types of rice last year, in an effort to curb rising domestic prices ahead of parliamentary elections after a volatile monsoon disrupted production and spurred fears of a supply shortage.\n\n\u201cWith India imposing export restrictions\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Pakistan emerged as a low-cost alternative,\u201d said Elvis John, an associate editor for agricultural markets for S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\n\u201cMany price-sensitive destinations in Africa turned to Pakistan to fulfil demand,\u201d he said, pointing to markets in south-east Asia and the Americas.\n\nPakistan produced almost 10mn tonnes of rice in the nine months to the end of March, compared with 7.3mn tonnes in the same period a year earlier, the Pakistani government wrote in its annual economic survey released on June 11.\n\nThe 2022-23 crop was particularly low because of the devastating floods in the summer of 2022, said Faizan Ghori, director of Matco Foods, Pakistan\u2019s largest basmati rice exporter. But even compared with the year before the floods, the current export growth \u201ccomes to about 20 per cent, which is still very impressive\u201d, he said, attributing the boost to India\u2019s export ban.\n\nFor Pakistan, the windfall revenues and rebound in production have provided a much-needed source of foreign exchange for the country of 240mn, which is struggling with double-digit inflation, anaemic economic growth and soaring public debt.\n\nGlobal rice prices surged to decade highs after New Delhi implemented export restrictions in July. Poorer countries in Africa, which typically buy large amounts of rice from India, were particularly affected.\n\n\u201cRice prices are still high and I would expect will remain high until India removes the ban,\u201d said Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at food security think-tank International Food Policy Research Institute.\n\nDespite the export ban, India continues to be the biggest supplier of rice globally, followed by Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan, said John, but Pakistan has increased its share in the market to about 10 per cent, up from 7 per cent in the previous year.\n\nHammad Attique, director of sales and marketing at Lahore-based Latif Rice Mills, said his company had seen a surge in demand and orders from the Middle East, Africa and south-east Asia, regions where Indian-origin rice typically dominates.

The auto industry accounts for about 7 per cent of India\u2019s economy and sales in the last financial year hit a record 4.2mn units.\n\nSince 1998 Hyundai, India\u2019s second-largest auto company by sales, has sold almost 12mn passenger vehicles domestically and by export, according to the prospectus.\n\nThe listing is likely to be scheduled around the Hindu festival of Diwali at the end of October, depending on regulatory processes and market conditions, the person familiar with the matter said.\n\nA spokesperson for Hyundai\u2019s Indian arm declined to comment. In a regulatory filing in February, the parent group said: \u201cWe are reviewing various activities including the listing of an overseas unit to boost corporate value.\u201d\n\nKim Kwang-soo, an analyst at LS Securities in Seoul, wrote in a report that Hyundai would raise about Won3tn-Won4tn ($2.2bn-$2.9bn) in the IPO and use the proceeds to increase capacity at its Indian plants. He estimated that India accounts for about 8 per cent of Hyundai\u2019s net profits.\n\nKranti Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities in Mumbai, described the prospective listing as \u201cbig news for India\u201d due to Hyundai\u2019s scale in the country.\n\nIndia\u2019s \u201cmarket has been quite strong and there\u2019s a lot of liquidity at this point of time\u201d, Bathini said. \u201cThere\u2019s positive sentiment in India, you see both the [benchmark] indices forming everyday all-time highs and auto sales have been quite good in the past two years.\u201d\n\nHyundai\u2019s offering is the latest in a spate of listings in India this year as strong domestic demand has sent the country\u2019s stock market to record levels, overtaking Hong Kong\u2019s index in market capitalisation.

Modi\u2019s largely economically aligned coalition needs India\u2019s powerful conglomerates to lay down big infrastructure projects to help realise Viksit Bharat, the prime minister\u2019s vision to build India into a developed nation by 2047.\n\n\u201cThe central message of the Indian voter this time is: less BS, more jobs,\u201d Chakravorti added. \u201cThe national champions, Adani, Reliance, Tata have the scale, momentum and relationships with enough people on either side of the political aisle to continue at the helm of these\u201d plans.\n\nWith 240 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, or lower house, the BJP is still by far India\u2019s most dominant political force. After negotiations with its kingmaker partners, it retained crucial ministries and many of its old ministers in the same portfolios, a sign investors took as a reassuring message of continuity.\n\nWhile corporate leaders claim their investment plans remain unchanged, many will quietly begin hedging political bets in a way they have been unused to for a decade. Indian industrialists, executives, lobbyists and analysts told the Financial Times that many remained fearful of being seen to talk out of turn about the prime minister.\n\nBusiness leaders that dared question Modi, his government or the quality of India\u2019s economic trajectory were, as with other critics, subjected to vitriolic attacks or hit with abrupt tax raids.\n\nDuring the weeks-long campaign Modi veered off course with an unprecedented condemnation against Ambani and Adani, accusing them of funnelling \u201ctruckloads\u201d of illicit funds to his opposition rivals.\n\n\u201cIt was quite amazing he attacked Adani and Ambani \u2014 we are still trying to figure it out,\u201d said a tycoon who attended Sunday\u2019s swearing-in and was trying to read the \u201ctea leaves\u201d of India\u2019s new political landscape. \u201cWe will have to wait and watch if there\u2019s a change of style.\u201dThat may play out across India\u2019s press. Controlled by big corporations with interests across multiple industries dependent on government goodwill \u2014 Ambani and Adani own expansive television networks \u2014 the mainstream media has played cheerleader to the BJP.\n\n\u201cA degree of sycophancy towards Modi may disappear, businesses will feel less of a need to pander and praise as much as they did before and less reticent engaging with the opposition,\u201d said the head of one business lobby.\n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to be seen with Rahul Gandhi and the Congress,\u201d they added, referring to India\u2019s main opposition party and leader.\n\nIn an article published after the vote, Aroon Purie, a media mogul and chair of the India Today Group, criticised the \u201cpervasive sense of fear\u201d the last administration cultivated, with businesses scared of \u201cgetting on the wrong side of the government\u201d.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the past regime would not have faced this electoral fate if it hadn\u2019t lived in its echo chambers,\u201d Purie wrote.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s \u201ctight control\u201d over institutions such as the media \u201cwill show some cracks\u201d, said Nirmalya Kumar, a former Tata executive and now Lee Kong Chian professor at Singapore Management University.\n\n\u201cThose people now fear that if the other party comes into power we can\u2019t be seen to be so close to Modi,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to start hedging their bets.\u201d\n\nSome Indian executives had privately grumbled about top-down government requests to invest in BJP stronghold states, such as Gujarat. \u201cThere might be possible diversification across states to appease some of the coalition parties,\u201d said one western diplomat.\n\nAnalysts expect Modi\u2019s alliance to stay the course on building out India\u2019s infrastructure, after boosting such spending to a record.\n\nBut after fostering a \u201cBillionaire Raj\u201d during his tenure, where 1 per cent of India\u2019s 1.4bn people earn more than a fifth of its wealth, according to a recent study by economists, including Thomas Piketty, the main question is whether Modi will aggressively pursue further welfare spending.\n\nMore handouts would spur consumption and stimulate private capital investment that has calcified at about 25 per cent of GDP, said one business leader. \u201cThis little rap on the knuckles is good for [Modi] and the economy,\u201d they said. \u201cWhat worries me is that this does not lead to any paralysis of reform.\u201d\n\nWhile economists expect Modi will struggle to reform land and labour laws to make India a more attractive manufacturing destination, foreign corporations are unlikely to alter their view on the world\u2019s fastest-growing big economy.\n\n\u201cBottom line, things are not going to change \u2014 from an economic perspective the coalition parties are not that different,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cWith the slowdown in China, it is the must-win market for every multinational.\u201d\n\nAt Sunday\u2019s swearing-in event in New Delhi, Adani and Ambani hobnobbed with fellow corporate leaders, politicians and Bollywood stars Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar.\n\n\u201cIt would appear [Modi] has decided to back certain horses, these are the Hyundais, these are the Samsungs of India,\u201d said Swaminathan Aiyar, research fellow at Washington\u2019s Cato Institute, referring to the chaebol conglomerates that dominate South Korea\u2019s economy. \u201cHe thinks these guys can do it.\u201d\n\nData visualisations by Janina Conboye\n\n\n\n\n\n",

"PwC\u2019s India boss is lobbying for a seat on the Big Four firm\u2019s global executive committee alongside his counterpart in China, arguing that the fast growth of its business and the rising importance of the Indian economy merit a position at the $53bn network\u2019s top table.\n\nSanjeev Krishan, chair of PwC India, in recent months petitioned senior figures for him to be added to the firm\u2019s influential network leadership team, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times.\n\nThe move has caused ructions within the accounting and consulting firm, with one senior figure familiar with the discussions saying that while the issue has not yet risen to the level of \u201ctensions\u201d, it is regarded by some within the network as a \u201cproblem\u201d.\n\nOne partner said Krishan had been \u201cpushing very hard\u201d for a seat while another, who has held global and national leadership roles at the firm, said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that the Indian business would be given a place on the committee.\n\nLike the rest of the Big Four firms \u2014 Deloitte, EY and KPMG \u2014 PwC is run as a worldwide network of partnerships linked through a global entity. The firm\u2019s network leadership team sets overall strategy and standards for its 151-country network.\n\nThe network leadership team currently consists of the firm\u2019s global chair, the leaders of its US, UK, and Asia-Pacific/China businesses, as well as its Europe boss, who holds a seat that can be rotated at the behest of PwC\u2019s global board.\n\n\u201cThe size and composition of PwC\u2019s network leadership team is determined by the regulations that govern the network and by PwC\u2019s global governance board,\u201d said a PwC International spokesperson. \u201cThere are no current plans to add any additional members to the network leadership team.\u201d\n\nThe Indian firm\u2019s lobbying underlines the sometimes contentious political manoeuvring that occurs within the Big Four\u2019s sprawling global networks and marks an early test for Mohamed Kande, the firm\u2019s incoming global chair.\n\nIt also comes as PwC\u2019s China business faces a crisis over its audits of collapsed property developer Evergrande. One of the senior partners said: \u201cIndia is very punchy at the moment because of what\u2019s going on with China.\u201d\n\nDemand for professional services in India has increased rapidly in recent years on the back of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s economic drive and the professionalisation of the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Indian firm was the fastest-growing of PwC\u2019s 21 largest businesses in the network last year, with revenues jumping by nearly a quarter. That performance propped up PwC\u2019s overall Asia-Pacific revenue growth, which at 7 per cent was slower than the other major regions, dragged down by China. The Indian firm expects to surpass $1bn in sales for the first time this financial year.\n\nOne person familiar with the Indian firm said it was well positioned to continue to grow at a fast pace because of the country\u2019s expanding economy and its young, growing population. PwC\u2019s China boss was added to the firm\u2019s network leadership team in 2008 because it was then seen as the region with the greatest growth potential, according to one senior partner.\n\nHowever, the Indian business remains small compared with some of those in other regions.\n\n\u201cIf you look at their numbers, the domestic [Indian business] is growing great, but from a very low base,\u201d said the partner who has held global and national leadership roles. \u201cTo put them on the network leadership team, you would also have to put Canada, France and the Middle East. Suddenly the network leadership team has 10 countries. That would not be workable.\u201d\n\nPwC\u2019s network leadership team, which met 25 times last year, is already set to be overhauled at the start of next month, when Kande, Marco Amitrano and Daniel Li take up their positions as respective heads of PwC global, UK and Asia-Pacific.

Front-row seats with the best views had fetched as much as $2,400, the site said.\n\nHigh-profile cricket fans including India-born Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella were in attendance for the match, which India won by 6 runs.\n\nMatches between cricket-obsessed neighbours India and Pakistan have become relatively rare, as the two countries have not played each other in a bilateral series for more than a decade amid rising tensions over the fate of Kashmir. The sides generally only meet in International Cricket Council tournaments such as the T20 World Cup and its longer-format 50-over equivalent.\n\nThe decision to bring the 2024 tournament, and its most-watched match-up, to New York is part of an ongoing effort by the sport to capitalise on the growing number of cricket fanatics in the US \u2014 mostly in south Asian communities \u2014 and attract new supporters to the game.\n\nA T20 franchise involving teams from cities including New York, Dallas and Seattle played its inaugural competition last year, and will enter its second season soon after the World Cup.

A smiling Modi bowed to the throng, before taking the oath of office as the crowd chanted his name.\n\nWhile Modi is India\u2019s first leader to secure a third straight term since independence premier Jawaharlal Nehru, his Bharatiya Janata party lost 63 seats in the lower house in India\u2019s six-week election, dramatically undershooting exit polls forecasting a landslide victory.\n\nThe BJP was shorn of its outright majority and left leaning on the 14 regional parties in its National Democratic Alliance. It marks the biggest blow to Modi during his decade in power, and he has since made unusually conciliatory comments about ruling through consensus.\n\nSunday\u2019s pomp followed days of jockeying between the BJP, which remains the largest party with 240 out of 543 seats, and politicians from the NDA, including two main kingmaking groups, the Telugu Desam and Janata Dal (United). Indian television stations reported that 11 of 72 ministerial positions would go to the BJP\u2019s allies.\n\nAnalysts say that the domineering Modi, who centralised control in his office and rammed through legislation with strong parliamentary support, will have to learn new diplomatic skills, slow politically contentious reform plans and tame the BJP\u2019s Hindu nationalist goals.\n\n\u201cModi does not have much experience ruling by consensus,\u201d said Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow at Chatham House in London. \u201cThis raises latent risks, particularly if the BJP alienates coalition partners by trying to encourage defections or splits within parties as has been the case in the past.\u201d\n\nHe added that kingmaker leaders, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam and Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal, are also \u201cprone to coalition flip-flopping\u201d.\n\nModi\u2019s cabinet was also sworn in on Sunday, with many from his last government returning to posts.

It was not immediately clear if the ministers would remain with the same portfolios.\n\nIndia\u2019s return to multi-party haggling, not seen since Modi first stormed to national power in 2014, has fuelled concerns among economists over fiscal slippage and the likely pressures on the government to dole out financial support for political interests.\n\nRating agency Moody\u2019s has warned that coalition politics could \u201cimpede progress on fiscal consolidation\u201d and slow down economic reforms as India looks to build out a globally competitive manufacturing industry.\n\nA survey published in The Hindu national newspaper on Thursday showed that it was concern over inflation and a lack of decent jobs to employ India\u2019s vast working-age population that cost Modi at the ballot box.\n\nModi\u2019s often-repeated Viksit Bharat (or Developed India) pledge \u2014 his promise to turn India into a developed country by 2047 \u2014 would remain a key component of his third term, \u201cparticularly as economic grievances were one of the factors that contributed to the election outcome\u201d, said Bajpaee.\n\n\u201cHowever, there will be course corrections, which are likely to be reflected in the July budget,\u201d he added. \u201cFiscal consolidation efforts may slow amid a renewed push on populist spending, such as an increased allocation to welfare schemes.\u201d", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/7648f8b8-b84a-4b07-88bd-f70532b0d322"}}, {"id": "d2be85f5-ebc1-48c9-960f-ad529d21e3e4", "event_name": "Reform may be the winner in the Indian election", "blurb": "The setback to Modi\u2019s high-handed style of rule can galvanise the economy and make the country a reliable partner   ", "date": "2024-06-0900:00:00.0", "body": "The writer is co-author with Rohit Lamba of \u2018Breaking the Mold: India\u2019s Untraveled Path to Prosperity\u2019 and former governor of India\u2019s central bank\n\nOn June 4, democracy won in India, a victory conferred by a wise electorate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s increasingly authoritarian government did not secure a majority, and now needs the support of coalition partners to stay in power. The election bodes well economically and politically for the country.\n\nBefore the election, policy was determined by the prime minister\u2019s office and the bureaucracy, then rubber-stamped by parliament, typically over the protests of the tiny opposition. A mix of carrots and sticks co-opted the mainstream media and business. Most worryingly, government agencies jailed two opposition chief ministers before the elections, and tax authorities froze the main opposition party\u2019s bank accounts for minor past transgressions. With the ruling party dominating fundraising, and Modi projecting himself as India\u2019s leader of destiny, the election seemed to be a walkover.\n\nFortunately, some institutions functioned reasonably independently. The supreme court unfroze the opposition\u2019s bank accounts. The government-appointed election commission, though unwilling to call out Modi\u2019s dog whistles, ensured some 650mn eligible citizens voted with little intimidation or fraud. Social media channels, some run by journalists squeezed out of their former jobs, attracted an audience tired of mainstream media bias.\n\nMoreover, authoritarian government has a weakness \u2014 it does not allow, and therefore cannot react to, feedback. While the government trumpeted overall growth, it did not acknowledge the hardship to households from rising unemployment, especially of youths, and high food prices. Faltering consumption growth was dismissed as data aberrations. The election results may have shocked the government and mainstream press, which predicted an overwhelming victory for the Modi administration, but they did not surprise anyone with an ear to the ground.\n\nInterestingly, reforms may pick up now. The Modi administration implemented a goods and services tax, inflation targeting and a bankruptcy code in its first term, but its cultural agenda dominated its second term. Agricultural reforms, passed without parliamentary consensus, were eventually withdrawn in the face of farmer protests.\n\nModi\u2019s coalition partners and the much stronger opposition in parliament will, hopefully, prevent any unilateral policy measures. But reforms to land and labour laws, which need more consensus building, may be back on the table. A chastened government may also aim to make growth more job-intensive, improving the lot of households. If the government focuses on equipping youth with employable skills, and reviving small and medium enterprises in labour-intensive sectors, economic growth could become more inclusive even in the short run.\n\nThe government also needs to review its plans for manufacturing exports-led growth, based on protectionist tariffs and subsidies. The world does not have political or climatic room for another China-sized economy exporting manufactured goods. India has other options. It already accounts for about 5 per cent of global services exports (and less than 2 per cent of goods exports). Exports of high-skilled services, such as consulting, telemedicine and design and software embedded in manufacturing, can lead the way. That requires a shift in spending, for instance repurposing billions of dollars of subsidies from capital-intensive chip manufacturing to investments in quality childcare, schools and colleges. Service exports would also benefit from stronger data privacy laws, including protection from government intrusion \u2014 something a more democratic India could enact.\n\nAs the ruling party\u2019s grip on power loosens, the mainstream media and bureaucracy will see more value in being impartial.\u00a0Democratic consensus can replace government-imposed fiat. This bodes well for the 2026 reapportionment of parliamentary seats between the economically faster-growing west and south and the demographically faster-growing north and east. Democratic India will probably reach a decision that all its citizens can live with, not one that divides the country.\n\nA more democratic India will be a more reliable friend to democracies around the world, even while its experience of colonialism gives it a different lens to that of the G7. India can be a bridge-builder in a fracturing world. This election, like that in Poland last year, shows authoritarianism can be halted. It also makes India more central to our collective future.", "region_codes": ["IN"], "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3464031d-a1c3-4e1c-b6c3-5c65db1493e0"}}]
