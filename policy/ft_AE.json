    "body": "The United Arab Emirates wants to build and consult on nuclear projects around the world, with the US as the fastest-growing market, the head of the country’s state-owned nuclear company has said. Emirates Nuclear Energy Company has become a major player since it was established in 2009. It completed the four reactors of its Barakah nuclear power plant, the first in the Arab world, in under 12 years, and on budget. The project was developed in partnership with Korea Electric Power Corp.The company, known as Enec, has built up investment and research and development teams to explore opportunities beyond the UAE, chief executive Mohamed Al Hammadi told the Financial Times. AI is set to drive a surge in demand for electricity to power data centres.\n\n“We are interested in all markets, very very interested,” Al Hammadi said. “We want to capitalise on our success and we are looking at what we can do: build in the UAE, outside the UAE, the whole market.”\n\nRoughly a quarter of the UAE’s electricity is now generated from nuclear power and up to 60 per cent in the winter when demand for air conditioning drops, Al Hammadi said.\n\n“Who has done what we did in the last 10 years?” said Al Hammadi, who also chairs the World Nuclear Association. “I will not compete with China or Korea, but if you look from here [the Middle East] to the west, we are the only ones.”\n\nEnec has been in discussions to invest in the UK’s Sizewell C project but Al Hammadi declined to comment on whether the company would proceed, only saying that negotiations had “been going through different cycles in the last year”.\n\nThe UK has pushed back the final investment decision on Sizewell, which was expected last year, to after the next government spending review expected in the spring, while the estimated cost of the project has doubled from less than five years ago.\n\nAl Hammadi suggested that the US is seeing the fastest growth in demand for nuclear power because of the boom in AI computing.\n\n“There’s much faster growth in energy demand, with the US leading in AI, and I think we are at the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “All the available energy in the US has been consumed over the last 18 to 19 months, and that is why they are even going after brownfield sites to restart some old [nuclear] units.”\n\nAsked if he wanted to build, own and operate nuclear power stations, invest in projects or be hired as a consultant, Al Hammadi said: “All of the above.” He said he was agnostic about whether Enec invests in reviving old reactors, large-scale projects or small modular reactors.\n\n“We have the institutional knowledge, we know how to structure deals, how to stitch them together and become a qualified, smart owner and how to manage these very complex projects, deliver them on time and also on budget,” he said.\n\nHe also suggested the UAE could play a role in building nuclear power stations in the global south. This month the gulf state signed a $15bn agreement for renewable projects in the Philippines, which is also in talks with Enec over a potential nuclear power station.\n\n“We are in an advanced stage of passing a regulatory framework for nuclear and that will help us carry out our plan to have nuclear power,” Raphael Lotilla, the Philippines’ energy minister, said in an interview in Abu Dhabi.",

    "blurb": "Developer Malik Riaz Hussain says fraud allegations by anti-corruption watchdog are attempt to ‘blackmail’ him ",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Pakistan is to request the extradition of the billionaire property tycoon Malik Riaz Hussain from the United Arab Emirates, targeting a powerful businessman linked to the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.\n\nThe National Accountability Bureau, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog, said Hussain was being investigated “for fraud, deceptive practices and cheating [the] public at large”.\n\nHussain, the owner of Bahria Town, Pakistan’s largest privately held real estate development company, had sold land for which he lacked ownership approval permits, the bureau said on Tuesday.\n\nAnalysts said the case was a major setback for a man once considered politically untouchable and that it suggested Pakistan’s military and government wanted to issue a warning to other influential figures with ties to Khan, who was toppled from government in 2022 but remains popular.\n\nKhan was sentenced to 14 years in prison last week after being convicted of illegally accepting land for an education institution from Hussain. Khan and his lawyers say the trial is a politically motivated attempt by the country’s military to banish him from the political arena.\n\nIn a statement posted on the social media site X on Wednesday, Hussain suggested the extradition announcement was an attempt to pressure him to testify in court.\n\nHe said he had been subject to “years of blackmailing, fake cases and greed of officers” and had been forced to move abroad because of his principle stance of “refusing to be a witness (political pawn)”.\n\n“No matter how much you oppress me, Malik Riaz will not testify!” the billionaire wrote. The “deplorable press release by NAB is actually a new demand for blackmail. I am resisting, but I am sitting with a storm in my heart.”\n\nAs well as saying Pakistan would seek the extradition of Hussain, who has lived in exile in the UAE since 2023, the accountability bureau warned that investors in an Emirati apartment project he launched earlier this month could risk facing money-laundering charges.\n\nMichael Kugelman, a fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington, said the action against Hussain suggested a desire among Pakistani authorities to “show the credibility of the case against Khan”.\n\n“But at its core I think it’s about widening the dragnet being pursued against all those with influence that have links to Khan,” Kugelman added, pointing to the Pakistan military’s current court martial of Faiz Hameed, a former spymaster said to have been close to Khan when he was prime minister.\n\nThrough Bahria Town, Hussain has since 1997 built vast housing developments outside Pakistan’s major cities that have become dream neighbourhoods for members of the aspirational middle class.\n\nEarlier this month, he inaugurated a new head office for BT Properties, a Bahria Town subsidiary that is developing properties in Dubai South, a planned suburb in the city’s rapidly urbanising inland areas.\n\n“We are not just entering Dubai’s real estate market — we are here to lead,” Hussain said at the opening ceremony.\n\nThe UAE’s foreign ministry declined to comment. Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Bahria Town pointed to Hussain’s social media post as the company’s stance.\n\nIn 2019, the UK National Crime Agency secured a deal with Hussain and his family under which they agreed to hand over £190mn held in the country.\n\nThe payout put an end to an NCA investigation in relation to the funds. The agency did not disclose the allegations that had led to freezing orders on the assets, but said the deal was a civil, rather than a criminal matter, and “does not represent a finding of guilt”.\n\nThe £190mn was returned to Pakistan, but the current government alleges Hussain was allowed to keep it in exchange for the illegal land transfer to Khan. Khan and Hussain have denied the accusations.",

    "event_name": "Millionaires in Dubai make everyone else feel poor",
    "blurb": "The influx of ultra-rich expats is putting pressure on the lifestyles of the merely wealthy",
    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "At a Tiki-themed bar in Dubai early last year, a man claiming to be a Scandinavian real estate millionaire ordered a round of tequila cocktails while yelling his formula for success in my ear (“fame, power and money”). His companion, a blonde air hostess, fell off her stool.\n\nThis absurd moment has come to feel like something of an omen. Bona fide millionaires — possibly possessing some fame and power, but definitely a lot of money — have flocked to the Middle East’s commercial hub in the past year. Wealth advisory firm Henley & Partners estimated that 6,700 millionaires would arrive in the United Arab Emirates in 2024, more than any other global destination.\n\nFor Dubai, whose boom and bust property market is in an unprecedented rally, this is a victory. Long pitching itself as a luxury lifestyle destination, Dubai has “always wanted to be Monaco and Singapore”, said one banker, “and that’s the direction it’s headed in”. Business owners say the city, once awash with chancers and dodgy cash, now has plenty of real talent and legitimate money.\n\nDubai has cracked the millionaire market, then. But the Monaco of the Middle East may now have to turn its attention to the middle class.\n\n“The arrival of the ultra-wealthy has created more options for people to spend large amounts of money,” said one expat who recently left for Europe after nearly two decades. “But it’s also made people feel much poorer.”\n\nThe moneyed global citizens filling expensive restaurants and buying beachside villas, plus a rush of workers wanting to cash in on Dubai’s boom, have put a strain on the city’s housing market, causing problems for families with lower incomes.\n\nDubai is now the world’s 15th most expensive city to live in, according to a global ranking by consultancy Mercer, and has the region’s highest cost of living. In 2020, it ranked at number 22 globally. British Mums, an online expat community, estimated last year that a family needed a monthly income of AED50,000 (around $13,600) to live comfortably here.\n\nThe costs are not yet putting people off. Dubai remains a magnet for migrants drawn by the glamour, absence of income tax, glorious winter weather and stability of the UAE’s 10-year “golden visa” programme.\n\nBut rising rents are biting. Property laws shield tenants from price-gouging to a certain extent, but rents have climbed so much overall — on average, over 20 per cent per year for the last two, according to Mercer — that many long-term residents face trading down. A friend who used to live in a villa with a garden has moved to a one-bedroom flat.\n\nDubai Land Department acknowledged the rise in housing demand but said it monitored real estate to ensure a balanced housing supply and had taken steps to help residents “across diverse income groups”.\n\nThere is unlikely to be much sympathy for white-collar workers who profited handsomely in the past. Renting in Dubai may be more expensive than, say, Paris or Frankfurt, but Mercer’s data shows it is still broadly cheaper than the financial hubs of London and Singapore.\n\n“Not everyone can afford to live in Chelsea,” said Dubai-based real estate agent Barnaby Crompton, citing the London market. “You have other areas where the diaspora are moving because they’re being priced out of the more centrally located places.”\n\nLower-paid employees — the drivers, waiters, cleaners and other vital workers who keep the sparkling city running — are squeezed into ever tighter accommodation further out or have less money to send to families.\n\nExpat message boards show plenty of debate over whether it still pays to stay in Dubai. “Rent and costs of education, health etc are making us believe that London might be better,” wrote one. “Financially it might be breaking even due to tax, but we’d be with our families and old friends.”\n\nMany come to Dubai in the expectation of finding fame, power or money. The reality, as the recently departed expat complained, can be different. “Beyond the glitz and glamour, there’s a lot of tears and sorrow in Dubai.”\n\nchloe.cornish@ft.ccom",

    "event_name": "‘Donald of Dubai’: real estate mogul rubbing shoulders with Trump",
    "blurb": "Hussain Sajwani has built swaths of the Middle East’s glitziest commercial hub and made an ally of the US president-elect",
    "date": "2025-01-1400:00:00.0",
    "body": "When Emirati billionaire Hussain Sajwani casually mentioned to his long-term business partner Donald Trump over dinner that he planned to expand into US data centres, the president-elect sensed an opportunity.\n\n“He says, ‘I have a press conference in a few days, and I would like to announce that’,” Sajwani said in a Financial Times interview last week in his villa on Dubai’s man-made Palm — a symbol of the entrepot’s excess and its appeal to global millionaires, from footballers to former warlords.\n\nAt a Mar-a-Lago press conference this month the world’s most powerful man described Sajwani as a “great investor”, as the pair stood side by side to announce a $20bn planned investment. This put a global spotlight on the Emirati entrepreneur, who started in food services and has built swaths of the Middle East’s glitzy commercial hub through his company Damac, Dubai’s biggest private residential developer.\n\nThe plan to spend $20bn over four years appears aspirational. Sajwani’s data centre company Edgnex does not yet have any contracts with tenants for their 2000MW of planned US data centres. The company, established in 2021, is close to having 15MW of operational data centres in Saudi Arabia and Thailand. The investment would be a large sum for Damac, which had $5bn in cash on its balance sheet as of June last year.\n\nSajwani says he expects to rely largely on bank loans to finance the plans, adding that the $20bn figure was estimated from “how much we think we can take from management time, land acquisition and our own capability of our own balance sheet”.\n\nSometimes called “the Donald of Dubai”, Sajwani is regarded as an outsider by the city’s business community. Belonging to the minority Shia Muslim sect, he is seen as a hard-charging risk taker who has clung on to the rollercoaster of Dubai’s boom-and-bust property market. “The old [Dubai] families don’t really like him,” said a Dubai-based executive who has worked with Sajwani.\n\nInstead, the real estate mogul has found a US ally. Sajwani and Trump have known each other since 2011 when Damac and the Trump Organization built the first Trump-branded golf course in the Middle East.\n\nPlans for a second, Tiger Woods-designed links in Dubai have foundered, Sajwani said, although the project remains on the Trump Organization’s website. Nonetheless, the families have stayed connected: Trump’s sons attended Sajwani’s daughter’s wedding, and Sajwani said their wives had become friends.\n\nThe Emirati tycoon has ties elsewhere in Trump’s inner circle. He has invested in Elon Musks’ SpaceX and xAI. The 72-year-old was pictured alongside both men at Trump’s New Year’s Eve celebration.\n\nSince the Dubai Trump International golf course, the Trump Organization has sold its name to developments with other partners in the region: a resort in Oman is under construction, while two towers — one in Saudi Arabia’s second city Jeddah and another in Dubai — are planned.\n\nThese Middle Eastern business ties have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest for the president-elect, although he has stepped away from the Trump Organization.\n\nTrump’s sons, who run the conglomerate, are hoping to capitalise on the strong post-Covid economic growth in the autocratic, hydrocarbon-rich Gulf region. “If you’re a developer, Dubai is almost a playground for you,” said Eric Trump in an FT interview last year, calling the region’s growth “explosive”.\n\nDubai’s latest boom has sent Damac’s sales soaring. Revenue for the six months to June 2024, the latest Damac Real Estate accounts available, hit $1.4bn, more than doubling from $690mn for the same period the previous year. Profit before tax jumped to $456mn, up from $297mn.\n\nSoftly spoken Sajwani, whose net worth Forbes puts at more than $5bn, is the son of a market trader and door-to-door saleswoman. Local businesspeople remember his first venture in the 1980s as a fast-food outlet in a mall. Sajwani then started an industrial catering company, and bought land and property in Dubai as it was establishing itself as a regional hub in the 1990s. He founded Damac in 2002.\n\nThe company barely survived the 2008 global financial crisis, and the bursting of Dubai’s property bubble. “We were struggling to pay salaries,” recalled Sajwani. “I went to the banks in 2008, November, and told all of them I’m in a very bad shape.” He said bankers restructured his debt while he negotiated with landowners and customers.\n\n“The guy has nine lives,” said a Dubai-based international banker. “He’s come close to imploding so many times.”\n\nThe company promoted its buildings from China to India, in an attempt to woo new buyers to Dubai’s volatile property market. But its reputation suffered from an association with poor-quality building work. “We had a challenge in 2011 and 2010,” Sajwani said. “We launched some products [ . . .] in a mediocre location. And we sold them very cheap.” He insisted the quality matched the price but acknowledged buyers may have expected better.\n\n“Were we perfect? No. There were buildings that, I agree, we could have done a much better job,” Sajwani admitted. “We learned the lesson . . . If you look at our buildings, which have been delivered recently in the past few years, I don’t think we had a quality issue.”\n\nPrivately owned Damac’s brash marketing techniques shook up a property market dominated by state-backed developers such as Nakheel and Emaar. As well as complimentary flights to Dubai for potential investors, Damac promised free luxury cars to apartment buyers.\n\nSuch promotions were criticised as “unethical” in 2014 by Mohamed Alabbar, chair of rival Emaar. But Sajwani called the giveaways “the best and the greatest idea”.\n\nDamac expanded beyond Dubai, with projects from Miami to the Maldives. However, Sajwani’s overseas adventures initially proved difficult: a 2006 land purchase in Egypt ended in a legal battle with the state following the 2011 ousting of dictator Hosni Mubarak. Sajwani was sentenced to five years’ jail time in absentia over corruption charges in 2011, although Egypt’s prosecutor-general later suspended the sentence. Sajwani said the trial was politically motivated.\n\n“After that, I stopped investing in countries where you’re going to have challenges,” Sajwani said.\n\nThe entrepreneur has not always endeared himself to outside investors. In 2022 he delisted Damac’s shares from the Dubai stock exchange, retaking full control. Some investors complained they had funded the company through market doldrums and were being ousted as the share price was turning in their favour.\n\nSajwani denied he timed the deal to reap rewards and said market “speculators” prompted the decision: “We didn’t see being public is benefiting us. We were getting a lot of negativity from the speculators.”\n\nUS data centres are his latest risky bet. Edgnex said it initially planned to form joint ventures with established players or potentially buy existing facilities and land prepared for development. Even so, analysts said reaching its goal of 2000MW of US capacity would be difficult in such a crowded market.\n\n“Once you have found the power, as a developer, especially as someone new to the space, the challenge is finding a spot in the queue to get all the equipment you need,” said Pat Lynch, head of real estate adviser CBRE’s Data Center Solutions team.\n\n“Oftentimes the biggest developers and the hyperscale [tech] companies have bought their ways into the queues several years out.”\n\nOne industry executive said that even a $20bn investment was unlikely to make a mark: “In the context of data centres it is almost a yawn.”\n\nDoubters are unlikely to bother Sajwani. Like his presidential business associate, Sajwani insists that his critics are uncomfortable with his role as a disrupter: “People will tell you, ‘Hussain Sajwani . . . He is a difficult man.’ Which successful man is easy?”",

    "body": "Sun-seeking Britons are rushing to book winter holidays in cheaper upcoming destinations while increasingly paying for trips in instalments, boosting travel agents and airlines in a traditionally quieter part of the year.\n\nLeading carriers and travel companies have reported a jump in bookings, with a surge in demand for getaways to north Africa and the United Arab Emirates alongside sustained appetite for Mediterranean countries.\n\nBut as living costs continue to bite, more Britons are spreading the cost of holidays over a longer period and booking either months in advance or at the last minute to find the best deals, according to travel executives.\n\nGarry Wilson, chief executive of easyJet holidays, said the travel arm of the budget airline expected bookings in the year to September 2025 to be up about 25 per cent on the previous 12 months, with Egypt and Tunisia driving growth in winter.\n\nWhile Malta, Cyprus and Majorca remained popular, “there are a lot of customers who are looking to try new destinations [and] for great value”, he said, adding that paying in monthly instalments was “increasing in popularity”.\n\nOnline travel agent On the Beach this week said bookings for winter, which runs between November and April, were at record levels and up 25 per cent year on year.\n\nBookings for Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt have soared 50 per cent compared with winter 2023, and demand for the Mediterranean remains robust despite the wave of anti-tourism protests this year.\n\nChief executive Shaun Morton said that although resorts in Greece and Turkey were stretching the start and end of their seasons, Britons were being drawn by “some very good all-inclusive products in north Africa” with guaranteed sun.\n\nUse of monthly instalments had “never been more popular”, he added, with the current take-up rate at 80 per cent and winter bookings representing 15 per cent of the travel agent’s total business.\n\nThe race for winter sun at affordable prices comes amid sustained holiday demand following the pandemic. Consumer card spending on travel rose by 6 per cent year on year in November, Barclays said this week, as “the winter blues prompted Brits to book getaways”.\n\nThe UK average mean temperature in November was 6.6C, according to the Met Office, the national weather service. In the same month, the average temperature in Marrakech, Morocco is 22C, while the average daily maximum temperature in Cairo, Egypt’s capital, is 24.9C.\n\nDonat Rétif, chief executive of loveholidays, said warm weather in north Africa was driving business, with bookings at the UK’s largest online travel agent for Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt up by 128 per cent, 36 per cent and 31 per cent respectively compared with 2023.\n\nAnother popular destination is the UAE: in October Virgin Atlantic increased flights from the UK to Dubai from three times a week to once a day, and loveholidays and On the Beach have reported higher demand.\n\nChinese online travel agent Trip.com said Christmas bookings by UK travellers to the UAE, whose capital is Abu Dhabi, had surged by 170 per cent compared with last year.\n\nAndy Washington, general manager for Europe, said the UAE had been boosted by being one of the first countries to open its borders after Covid and that milder temperatures in winter compared with summer was driving bookings.\n\nSome 2,105 flights were due to take off between Dubai and the UK between October and December, equating to more than 964,000 seats, the most ever offered in that quarter of the year, according to aviation data analyst Cirium.\n\nIssam Kazim, chief executive of the Dubai Corporation for Tourism and Commerce Marketing, said Britons, who are the second-largest market after travellers from India, were attracted by the country’s “safety, security and infrastructure”.",

    "blurb": "Deal for $10bn Silver Rock Financial underscores Gulf nation’s ambition to evolve beyond passive investing ",
    "date": "2024-12-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Mubadala Capital, the asset management arm of Abu Dhabi’s state investment fund, is acquiring a large stake in a US-based credit manager as it seeks to build a global player in private capital based in the Middle East. The firm is buying a 42 per cent stake in Silver Rock Financial, a Los Angeles-based credit investment specialist backed by the family office of onetime “junk bond king” Michael Milken and led by executives who used to manage the billionaire’s sprawling portfolio of private investments. Mubadala Capital will also take in an investment from Milken’s family office, accepting outside equity for the first time. The deal underscores Abu Dhabi’s growing ambition to not just passively invest its ample capital in ventures around the world but also to manage and guide decisions and deals for others. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mubadala Capital chief executive Hani Barhoush called the tie-up, which will be formally announced later on Thursday, a significant milestone.\n\n“Our strategic objective since we were established was to build a significant Abu Dhabi-based third-party asset manager,” said Barhoush. “We are pretty advanced, but there is still a long way to go and a lot of room to grow.”Silver Rock, which manages about $10bn in assets with a speciality in structured products and high-yield debt investments, will push Mubadala Capital into the fast-growing arena of private credit investments.\n\nMubadala Capital manages about $27bn in assets, with about $18bn managed on behalf of third-party investors such as Milken’s family office M-Cor and large institutions. It also manages about $9bn of cash coming from the balance sheet of its majority owner Mubadala Investment Company, the $302bn state investment fund. Typically, local sovereign wealth funds and wealthy individuals in the region have invested in private markets through US- and Europe-based groups such as Apollo, Blackstone, CVC and KKR. However, Mubadala decided to create the independent Mubadala Capital unit in 2011 with the goal of it becoming large and skilled enough to attract outside investment dollars.\n\nUnder Barhoush and chief investment officer Oscar Fahlgren, Mubadala Capital has invested heavily in private equity and venture capital deals, backing companies such as high-end stroller maker Bugaboo and Arbol, a start-up focused on climate risk insurance. It also has invested heavily in Brazil and is providing structured equity financing to strong companies with overleveraged balance sheets.\n\nOver the past 18 months, Mubadala Capital has quickened its investment pace, emerging as a dealmaking force in the Middle East.\n\nIts funds acquired a majority stake in Fortress Investment Group for about $3bn in May and recently announced a C$12.1bn ($8.6bn) deal for CI Financial, a large asset manager.\n\nThe group’s deal for Silver Rock, however, is its first strategic acquisition.\n\nMubadala Capital will pay with a mixture of cash and stock. Existing equity owners of Silver Rock, including chief executive Carl Meyer and Milken’s family office, will take minority equity interests in Mubadala Capital at an undisclosed valuation. Separately, Mubadala Capital will also invest more than $1bn into Silver Rock’s funds.\n\nMubadala and Silver Rock have worked on previous deals together, including a 2012 takeover of EMI Music Publishing, which they sold to Sony for $4.75bn in 2018.\n\nOther areas of strategic expansion could eventually include infrastructure or strategies dedicated to buying private equity fund stakes, said Fahlgren.",

    "blurb": "Food delivery group’s listing comes as UAE is on track to beat rest of Emea region for IPO values",
    "date": "2024-11-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Middle East-based food delivery company Talabat has raised $2bn in the Gulf’s biggest initial public offering this year, as the region bucks a global downturn in flotations.\n\nTalabat, which is German group Delivery Hero’s food delivery and quick commerce business in the Middle East and north Africa, priced its IPO at Dh1.60 per share, it said on Friday. That gives it an implied market capitalisation of about Dh37.3bn ($10.1bn) — just below its Frankfurt-listed parent company, which is worth $11bn. It will list on the Dubai stock exchange.\n\nThe move helps keep the United Arab Emirates, which has exchanges in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, on track to raise more money through IPOs than any other nation in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region for the third year running, according to Dealogic data.\n\nDemand for IPOs in the UAE has recently been boosted by “a lot of investors moving here, which also created more awareness or comfort with the strength of the region”, said Miguel Azevedo, Citigroup’s investment banking vice-chair for the Middle East and Africa. “People see the GDP growing on the streets.”\n\nHe added: “In 2022, 2023 and even a bit of 2024, international markets have not been very active. So it also makes the burst of activity here in the region more visible when you put it in an international context.”\n\nRegional rival Riyadh’s stock exchange typically has many more IPOs than the UAE — more than four times last year — but the size of IPOs in the UAE has been higher.\n\nTalabat’s chief executive Tomaso Rodriguez said it made sense to list in Dubai because it is where the business is based and “we see a lot of interest from local and international investors in Dubai as a hub”.\n\nThe UAE’s surge in IPO activity in recent years marks a major turnaround for its capital markets. Having not made it into the top 10 Emea markets for value of IPOs for three straight years from 2018 to 2020, the UAE surged from ninth place in 2021 to first in 2022. It ranked fourth globally last year, behind China, the US and India, Dealogic data shows.\n\nThe surge has been jump-started by government efforts to sell shares in state-owned businesses. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi hoped flotations would improve governance levels and other business performance, while Dubai wanted to shake up its capital market, which it had struggled to revive after the 2008 financial crisis and where it was losing ground to Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Abu Dhabi.\n\nAbu Dhabi’s state energy company floated its fuel distribution unit in 2017, raising about $850mn. Dubai’s state utility company raised $6.1bn in 2022, and state parking group Parkin raised $429mn this March.\n\nThe move towards privatisation has spread to neighbouring Oman, which boasted the region’s joint-largest IPO this year with a $2bn listing of a state-owned pipelines business. It raised fractionally less than Talabat.\n\nBut in the UAE, a growing share of listings are by private companies such as Talabat, buoyed by investors wanting access to growing Gulf markets.\n\nRegional supermarket chain Lulu Retail raised $1.7bn on the Abu Dhabi stock exchange this month and high-end grocer Spinneys raised $375mn in May through a Dubai listing.\n\nTalabat shares are expected to start trading on December 10 after the offering attracted “a double-digit oversubscription level”, according to the company. Their performance will be closely watched by investors, after the lacklustre debuts of Lulu Retail and Oman’s OQ Exploration and Production.\n\nDelivery Hero earlier this week said it was increasing the size of the IPO to 20 per cent of Talabat, up from 15 per cent. It intends to retain a long-term majority indirect ownership position.\n\nThe IPO “not only demonstrates the region’s buoyant market but also provides Delivery Hero with capital for growth while maintaining majority control”, said Alex Frederick, senior emerging technology analyst at market data company PitchBook.\n\nIn third-quarter results earlier this month, the German group reported that the total value of goods sold by its Middle East and north Africa business had grown 30 per cent year on year to €3.2bn, above the overall group’s 9 per cent growth.",

    "date": "2024-11-2500:00:00.0",
    "body": "An arm of Abu Dhabi’s state investment fund is buying Canadian asset manager CI Financial in one of the largest direct investments into North America by energy-rich Middle Eastern buyers as they increase their investment plans in the region.\n\nMubadala Capital, the asset management subsidiary of the $302bn-in-assets state-backed investment fund, has agreed to pay C$32 a share for CI Financial, representing a 33 per cent premium to its Friday closing price.\n\nThe deal ascribes the Toronto-based investment manager, which has more than C$500bn in assets and a long history of managing money for wealthy US and Canadian investors, an equity value of C$4.7bn ($3.36bn), or an enterprise value of C$12.1bn when including its debt.\n\nThe takeover marks Mubadala Capital’s largest acquisition and comes as its chief executive Hani Barhoush told the Financial Times last month that he was preparing a deal push in North America, spotting an opportunity to plough cash into complex management buyouts, or to build stakes in private equity-owned businesses.\n\nMubadala, which recently raised a $3.1bn private equity fund, will rely on a large equity investment by its parent company to finance a takeover commitment that is larger than its entire fund. The structure is similar to Mubadala’s $3bn acquisition of credit manager Fortress Investment Group from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, which was completed earlier this year and also relied on billions in support from its parent company.\n\nIn both deals, Mubadala is investing alongside existing management, who will be retained through the takeover and roll over large equity interests.\n\nCI Financial’s management owns almost 16.9 per cent of the company. Chief executive Kurt MacAlpine will roll all of his shares while chair William Holland will roll up to 25 per cent of his stake.\n\nMubadala has also agreed to keep the CI Financial’s data in Canada. Mubadala made a similar concession as part of its takeover of Fortress, agreeing to keep its technology and data domiciled in the US to appease regulators such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States as it scrutinised the deal.\n\nCI Financial, which owns large wealth management operations in the US, has seen its share price stagnate in recent years as it accumulated heavy debts during an acquisition binge. Last year, it took a $1bn investment into its US wealth unit, called Corient, and said it would consider spinning off the operation. However, Mubadala plans to keep CI Financial’s operations together under private ownership, according to people familiar with its plans.\n\nMubadala’s acquisition comes as the Middle East-based fund has increased its pace of investments. In addition to Fortress, it has acquired high-end baby stroller brand Bugaboo, and Spanish IT consultancy Babel, over the past year. Barhoush told the FT last month that Mubadala Capital was also looking to buy large direct stakes in private equity-owned businesses where sellers were seeking liquidity.\n\n“We are fully aligned with the strategy and direction of the firm and look forward to working with the CI management team to continue to build this outstanding business,” Barhoush said in a press release.",

    "date": "2024-11-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "An Israeli-Moldovan man who had been missing in the United Arab Emirates has been found dead, Israeli authorities announced on Sunday, calling his killing “an abhorrent act of antisemitic terrorism”.\n\nEmirati intelligence and security services located the body of Zvi Kogan, an emissary for the Jewish Chabad religious group, three days after he vanished after leaving the store where he worked.\n\nThe UAE interior ministry said on Sunday evening that three suspects had been arrested, without giving details of their identity. Neither Israel nor the UAE gave any information about the circumstances in which Kogan was killed.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister’s office said Israel would “use all means and will deal with the criminals responsible for his death to the fullest extent of the law”.\n\nIt also told Israeli citizens to take extra precautions in the UAE, and reiterated a warning against all but essential travel to the country. The Gulf state, which is the region’s trade, tourism and finance hub, was the first of three Arab countries that normalised relations with Israel in a landmark deal in 2020, known as the Abraham Accords.\n\nAfter the deal, the UAE welcomed Israeli tourists and business people, particularly technology entrepreneurs as it sought to build economic ties, with a focus on tapping Israeli technology.\n\nThe small, autocratic state, which has a highly sophisticated security apparatus, was considered one of the safest countries in the region for Israelis to travel to.\n\nThe killing comes at a turbulent time in the Middle East, which is in the grip of a spiralling conflict that began with Hamas’s October 7 2023 attack on Israel. It has since escalated across the region, with Israeli forces launching a ground invasion of Lebanon, exchanging missile salvos with Iran, and trading fire with Iranian proxies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.\n\nThe UAE has remained committed to the Abraham Accords, while joining other Arab states in condemning the devastation caused by Israel’s more than year-long assault against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIn a separate incident on Sunday, Jordanian state media said a suspected gunman was shot dead and three policemen injured after a shootout near the Israeli embassy in the Jordanian capital Amman.\n\nIsraeli officials gave no information about whom they believed was behind the killing of Kogan or their motive. Israeli media reported that Emirati officials suspected that a cell linked to Iran was behind the killing.\n\nIn 2020, Iranian operatives abducted a German-Iranian national from Dubai, before spiriting him back to Iran, where he was executed last month.\n\nMembers of the Israeli community in the UAE said Kogan was well known locally for running a kosher supermarket. Chabad, an ultra-Orthodox religious organisation that has representative offices all over the world, confirmed Kogan’s death, and described him as a rabbi and emissary of the group.\n\nIsrael’s President Isaac Herzog said the killing would “not deter us from continuing to grow flourishing communities in the UAE or anywhere — especially with the help of the dedicated commitment and work of the Chabad emissaries all over the world”.\n\nThe US National Security Council said it was co-ordinating with Israeli and UAE authorities.\n\n“This was a horrific crime against all those who stand for peace, tolerance, and coexistence,” a spokesperson said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Steff Chavez in Washington",

    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer will travel to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates next month in a bid to drum up fresh investment for the UK from the oil-rich Gulf, according to people familiar with his plans.\n\nThe British prime minister’s trip is part of a drive to strengthen UK diplomatic relations in the region and seek billions of pounds from Gulf sovereign wealth funds to boost the Labour government’s growth agenda.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto leader, may also visit London next year, but plans are yet to be finalised.\n\nThe UK is keen to secure investment from Gulf countries for sectors ranging from energy to infrastructure, including projects such as the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in eastern England.\n\nThe UK’s trade relationship with the six member nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council is worth £57bn, according to British officials.\n\nSaudi Arabia has significant investments in the UK, including chemical plants in Teesside, and the country’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, is the majority owner of Newcastle United football club.\n\nThe UK also believes Saudi Arabia will play an important role in helping western diplomatic efforts to secure a durable settlement to the crisis triggered by Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023 and the Netanyahu government’s retaliatory response.\n\nRiyadh has been urging the UK, Japan and Italy to allow it to become a full partner in a next-generation fighter jet project called the Global Combat Air Programme. The previous Tory government was open to the idea of Saudi membership.\n\nUK trade minister Douglas Alexander attended the kingdom’s investment forum in Riyadh last month in a bid to deepen commercial ties, while British foreign secretary David Lammy met Emirati counterpart Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi in September.\n\nBritish officials said UK ministers wanted to introduce the Labour government to Gulf partners, and were at pains to reset relations with the UAE.\n\nIn 2021, the UAE pledged to spend £10bn in the UK, which is understood to have been fully invested, including in the life sciences, renewable energy and technology sectors.\n\nBut Gulf officials have since complained of a lack of focus as the former Tory government went through periods of turmoil.\n\nStarmer’s visit comes after Saudi shelved plans for Prince Mohammed to visit London last autumn, prompting Conservative MPs to raise questions about the strength of the bilateral relationship.\n\nMeanwhile, links between the UK and the UAE fell into their worst state in years, after comments this year by British politicians about a blocked Abu Dhabi-backed bid to buy the Telegraph newspaper sparked frustration among Emirati officials.\n\nRelations soured further after the UAE interpreted the UK as delivering a snub at the UN over the conflict in Sudan.\n\nIn May Oliver Dowden, the then Conservative deputy prime minister, was forced to undertake a secret diplomatic mission to the UAE to try to build bridges.\n\nStarmer’s trip in the coming weeks threatens to compound criticism from Labour party figures concerned about the amount of time the prime minister has spent out of the UK since winning the general election in July.\n\nHe is currently in Rio attending a G20 summit, last week went to Baku for a UN climate meeting, and also spent the best part of five days away from the UK attending a Commonwealth heads of government gathering in Samoa last month.\n\nIn addition, Starmer has travelled to the US three times and visited multiple European destinations including Paris, Berlin, Rome, Brussels and Dublin in the four and a half months since he became prime minister.",

    "blurb": "Saudi Arabia and UAE welcome president-elect but worry he could upend rapprochement with Tehran and inflame Middle East war",
    "date": "2024-11-1200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Saudi Arabia and the UAE have signalled they remain committed to de-escalation with Iran as they prepare for the return of Donald Trump, hoping he can end a year of war in the Middle East but wary his unpredictability could inflame tensions further.\n\nLeaders like Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman were among Trump’s most enthusiastic Arab backers during his first term as US president, welcoming both his adversarial approach to Iran and his transactional style after years of Gulf frustration with American policy.\n\nBut in the years since, the Gulf’s two powerhouses — Saudi Arabia and the UAE — have changed tack, seeking to engage with Tehran amid doubts about the US’s commitment to their security. This became more urgent after Hamas’s October 7 2023 attack against Israel triggered a wave of regional hostilities and heightened tensions between the US and Iran, with both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi seeking to remain on the sidelines.\n\nGulf leaders, who traditionally prefer a Republican presidency, have welcomed Trump’s re-election and hope the self-styled dealmaker fulfils his campaign pledge to bring peace to the region. But diplomats and people close to regional governments say they are also wary he could give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu more licence to escalate against Israel’s foes and to raise tensions with Iran, risking an all-out conflict that could spill over into the Gulf states.\n\n“If Trump puts you in a situation where you have to decide [which side to take], because he’s going against Iran, it’s a big problem,” a senior Arab diplomat said. “Trump is not the kind of guy who takes ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nIn a sign of Riyadh’s desire to maintain its cold peace with Iran, Prince Mohammed on Monday hosted senior Iranian officials at an Arab-Muslim conference in Jeddah in which he accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. He also condemned Israel’s strikes on Iran, calling on the international community to stop hostile actions on Iranian territory.\n\nSeparately, Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s presidential adviser, told a conference in Abu Dhabi on Monday that the incoming Trump administration must pursue a “comprehensive” approach instead of “reactive and piecemeal” policies.\n\nThe comments underlined the shift in Saudi and Emirati thinking since they actively courted Trump after he took office in 2017 following years of Arab frustration with US policy swings and a sense of disengagement from the region.\n\nBoth Riyadh and Abu Dhabi cheered the Trump administration’s hawkish stance on Iran, his decision to abandon the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers and to impose crippling sanctions on the republic.\n\nBut as Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign sent tension soaring across the region, they became aware of their own vulnerability to Iranian hostility.\n\nGulf rulers’ faith in the US’s willingness to defend them was particularly shaken after a missile and drone attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure in 2019 temporarily knocked out half of the kingdom’s crude production. While Washington blamed Iran, Trump chose not to respond beyond imposing more sanctions.\n\nGiorgio Cafiero, chief executive of Washington-based Gulf State Analytics, said that by the time Trump’s first term ended, regional leaders “realised that in practice [it] had not succeeded in making the Gulf Arab monarchies more secure”.\n\nWith confidence in the US security umbrella undermined, Saudi and the UAE decided de-escalation with Iran was the best bet to protect their states and allow them to focus on economic diversification.\n\nThis culminated in a China-brokered agreement in March 2023 that re-established diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran after a seven-year rift. Gulf leaders’ concern now is that an even broader conflagration in the Middle East could undermine their domestic development plans.\n\n“The deal supported by China is for the good of the region,” said a person familiar with the Saudi government’s thinking. “Saudi Arabia will remain committed to it as long as [Iran is] committed.”\n\nThe kingdom “believes the focus should be on economic development and the success of its vision, which ultimately will offer the region a vision for a way forward beyond conflict, a vision that should benefit everybody.”\n\nFayyad al-Ruwaili, chief of staff of the Saudi armed forces, was on Sunday with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Bagheri in Tehran to discuss defence co-operation as part of the Beijing agreement, the kingdom’s Ministry of Defense said.\n\nBut while vowing to bring peace to the Middle East, Trump has also expressed support for Israel’s military offensives and appears set to appoint Iran hawks to his administration.\n\nElise Stefanik, Trump’s pick for US ambassador to the UN, wrote on X that “the US is ready for a return to President Trump’s MAXIMUM PRESSURE campaign against Iran”.\n\nGulf leaders fear the president-elect, who implemented a string of pro-Israeli policies in his first term, could embolden Netanyahu rather than rein him in.\n\n“We’ll stand on the sideline, we are protected,” the diplomat said, but added: “Any defence system can be exhausted. It’s not a joke.”\n\nStill, both Prince Mohammed and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE’s president, will look forward to having closer personal relationships with Trump than they had with President Joe Biden.\n\nThe relationship with Trump and his entourage continued after he left the White House, with his son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin receiving billions of dollars from Gulf sovereign wealth funds for investment firms run by the two former officials.\n\nBiden was initially critical of Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed after he entered office, vowing to reassess Washington’s relations with the kingdom after the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi. But ties improved as Biden pushed for a three-way deal that would have led to the US agreeing to a defence treaty with Saudi Arabia in return for the kingdom normalising relations with Israel.\n\nThose plans were upended by the war in Gaza. Trump, who counted the 2020 Abraham Accords normalisation between Israel, the UAE and three other Arab states as one of his biggest foreign policy successes, may seek his own grand bargain.\n\nBut that would require both ending Israel’s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hizbollah in Lebanon and getting it to make concessions towards the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\n“The sense we get [is that] President Trump wants a deal to end the war in Gaza”, another Arab diplomat said. “Will it be what everyone wants? Maybe not. But it would end the war.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Andrew England in London",

    "blurb": "Deal with Thoma Bravo shows growing role of Middle Eastern investors",
    "date": "2024-11-1100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund is buying a large stake in data analytics software company Qlik at a valuation of about $10bn, as appetite grows among Middle Eastern investors for businesses owned by the world’s biggest buyout groups.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia) will invest about $1bn into Qlik as part of a deal that will see its private equity owner Thoma Bravo sell on the US-based software group among its other funds, according to three people briefed on the matter. Adia’s investment will be announced later on Monday.\n\nThoma Bravo, a specialist software buyout group, acquired Qlik in 2016 for about $3bn. The fund that bought Qlik will now sell its stake to Adia, a group of other large pensions and sovereign wealth funds, and two newer Thoma Bravo funds for a gain of about three times its investment, the sources said.\n\nThe deal adds to a string of large financings done by Adia and many other Middle Eastern funds in recent years as private equity investors have slowed the pace of deals because of higher interest rates, and struggled to exit older investments. Funds such as Adia have become important sources of equity financing for new takeovers and acquired stakes in companies such as Qlik, where private equity firms are seeking liquidity for their investors.\n\nAdia recently backed Advent International’s purchase of a stake in US wealth manager Fisher Investments, Blackstone’s $14bn acquisition of a climate technology business from engineering group Emerson, and KKR’s €22bn acquisition of Telecom Italia’s fixed-line phone and internet network.\n\nAdia has also bought into businesses moving between private equity firms’ funds. In 2022, it bought a large stake in business services company TMF Group as its private equity owner CVC Capital Partners sold the company from one fund to another. Mubadala, another heavyweight fund in the Middle East, has also spotted an opportunity to make large investments at what it believes are attractive valuations.\n\nQlik’s recapitalisation drew interest from many new investors after its business accelerated over the past year. Its sales are on track to reach $1.5bn this year and bookings for its software subscriptions are up 30 per cent from the prior year, sources said. In 2022, Thoma Bravo merged Qlik, which is used by companies ranging from Domino’s Pizza to Airbus to analyse performance data, with Talend, a rival software company it acquired in 2021 for $2.4bn.\n\nInvestors in the 2021-era Thoma Bravo fund that acquired Talend will make an additional equity investment in Qlik. The group’s 2022-era fund will make a large investment, said the sources. Thoma Bravo will also finance part of Monday’s recapitalisation by raising an additional $1.7bn in debt.\n\nThoma Bravo had to win approval from its investors for the fund-to-fund deal and was advised by Guggenheim Partners.\n\nThe once-niche investment group has become one of the industry’s most active dealmakers after its assets soared from about $20bn a decade ago to $160bn at present. It became a prime example of the deal bubble in 2021 after it invested almost all of a $22.8bn fund in a year when tech valuations hit stratospheric levels, only to then plunge when interest rates soared.\n\nSince 2022, the group has focused on returning cash to its investors and sold down $20bn in investments since September 2023, realising large gains that have appeased many investors.\n\nIt sold financial software business Adenza to Nasdaq for $10.5bn, generating billions in gains for its 2021 fund, and closed a handful of other large investments this year. The group is in discussions to sell additional assets and launch public offerings of its portfolio companies as corporations increase their deal appetite and capital markets reopen.\n\nThoma Bravo has remained an aggressive buyer of software companies, striking large deals for Coupa Software and Darktrace in recent years. It is raising its 16th buyout fund, which is targeting about $20bn, according to pension fund documents seen by the Financial Times.",

    "body": "An arm of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund is preparing a push into private equity markets, spotting what it believes is an opportunity to take over large holdings as buyout groups race to sell assets and return cash to investors. Mubadala Capital, the asset management subsidiary of the $302bn sovereign wealth fund, has raised $3.1bn for its latest private equity fund, surpassing a $2bn target.\n\nIt is positioning the fund as a solution to private equity groups seeking to exit large bets, or PE-backed companies managing heavy debt burdens that need fresh capital.Mubadala’s private equity fund generally is seeking to invest between $150mn to $350mn in equity per investment, but will push that investment to as much as $500mn for “great ideas”. It now manages $24bn, three-quarters of which comes from external investors.\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of limited partners are short on liquidity,” said Oscar Fahlgren, chief investment officer of Mubadala Capital, in an interview with the Financial Times. “There’s a focus on realisations by a lot of funds, and that’s driving interesting opportunities for those of us who are well capitalised.”\n\nThis year Mubadala Capital has increased its investment pace, striking large deals to buy credit manager Fortress Investment Group, high end baby stroller brand Bugaboo, and Spanish IT consultancy Babel.\n\nHani Barhoush, chief executive of Mubadala Capital, said a two-year lull in private equity deal making had created a window for the fund to use its financial prowess to build majority investments in large PE-backed companies.\n\nThough Mubadala Capital’s private equity fund is small relative to funds raised by industry giants such as Blackstone and KKR, it uses equity financing from its sovereign wealth parent to fund large-scale takeovers.\n\nEarlier this year, Mubadala Capital acquired a majority stake in Fortress from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank at a valuation of about $3bn.\n\nThe complex deal is part of Mubadala’s bet that private fund managers will see their growth fuelled as private investment opportunities become increasingly available to individual investors, said Barhoush and Fahlgren.\n\nIn the takeover of Fortress, Mubadala Capital agreed to an about $2bn equity commitment that was more than its private equity fund had in assets at the time. It was able to complete the deal with additional capital from its corporate parent.\n\nOnce the deal was agreed and went through regulatory approvals, Mubadala Capital then syndicated the equity commitment to other investors.\n\n“One of the luxuries we have, given the size of our balance sheet and the size of our parent company, is we can write much larger cheques,” said Barhoush.",

    "date": "2024-10-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Ireland has signed an extradition treaty with the UAE, tightening the net on the notorious Kinahan criminal gang just over a week after one of its top lieutenants was arrested in Dubai.\n\nIreland’s justice minister Helen McEntee on Monday signed two treaties in Abu Dhabi with her counterpart Abdullah bin Sultan bin Awad al Nuaimi, after more than two years of diplomatic efforts. Ireland said the agreements “represent a crucial step in intensifying the combined fight” against organised crime.\n\nLed by Daniel Kinahan, the biggest European drug lord still at large, the Irish crime family is a key player in the Dubai-based “super cartel” estimated to have supplied a third of Europe’s cocaine.\n\nOther “super cartel” kingpins, including the Netherlands’ Ridouan Taghi and Italy’s Raffaele Imperiale, have been extradited and sentenced in their home countries. The lack of such a bilateral treaty with the UAE meant no such avenue had been open to Ireland.\n\n“It’s a big step in the right direction,” said Michael O’Sullivan, former assistant commissioner for the Garda, the Irish police force, in charge of national crime and security intelligence services. “It does look like they’re getting all their ducks lined up.”\n\nO’Sullivan said he imagined the Kinahans “will now be looking for another safe haven somewhere else”.\n\nThe Ireland-UAE treaties were signed as senior Kinahan cartel members Liam Byrne and Thomas “Bomber” Kavanagh — considered top bosses of the group’s UK and Irish operations — awaited sentencing at the Old Bailey in London on firearms charges. Both have pleaded guilty.\n\nThis month, Dubai authorities arrested Sean McGovern, believed to be the right-hand man of Daniel Kinahan, who has been holed up in the Gulf city-state for years. McGovern, described by Interpol as “one of Ireland’s most wanted fugitives”, is being sought by the Irish on murder charges.\n\nO’Sullivan said Ireland would now have to formally request McGovern’s extradition, adding: “I’d be surprised if he didn’t contest it. He’ll fight tooth and nail.” Experts believe his trial would put key information about the Kinahans’ operations in the public domain.\n\nIreland’s director of public prosecutions declined to comment on whether it would bring charges against Daniel Kinahan. It has been reviewing a Garda file on him for more than a year. The UAE has already frozen the gang’s assets.\n\nExpats have reported sightings of the Kinahans in Dubai but concrete details of whether they remained there were not known.\n\nGarda commissioner Drew Harris has urged Kinahan associates to break with the gang and co-operate with authorities to capture their boss. “They should look about them, they should see what is happening here and they should remember that there is $15mn with US federal law enforcement and the US federal witness protection scheme open, and they should consider that . . . given the progress . . . we are making to the Kinahan organised crime gang.”\n\nThe US is offering rewards of $5mn each for information leading to the arrests of Daniel Kinahan and of his father Christy Sr and brother Christopher.\n\nPeople briefed on the UAE’s position said that if presented with an arrest warrant with detailed charges by Ireland, the UAE was likely to start extradition proceedings through the local courts. Enhanced co-operation on law enforcement was one of the means through which the UAE demonstrated enhanced compliance with financial regulations that led to the country’s removal earlier this year from a watch list of international money-laundering destinations.\n\nAt their peak, the Kinahans appeared untouchable — with their illicit activities spawning “mind-boggling” wealth, according to a top detective.\n\nDaniel Kinahan inherited the cartel from his father and cultivated ties to professional boxing alongside his drug operations.",

    "body": "Etihad Airways is hoping to take advantage of congestion at Dubai airport to win new business for its Abu Dhabi home base, in the fiercely competitive market for long-haul flights routed through the Gulf.\n\nThe airline wants to increase passenger numbers to 30mn by 2030, up from 13mn last year, by attracting more people to break their long-haul flights with a stopover in Abu Dhabi.\n\nEtihad, which is owned by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, mainly competes on long-haul flights with Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines. All four are expanding, though Etihad remains the smallest. Saudi Arabia is also planning to launch an airline next year.\n\nEtihad’s chief executive Antonoaldo Neves told the Financial Times that there was plenty of room and demand for Abu Dhabi to expand its aviation industry.\n\n“From an airline perspective, Dubai is really congested right now. There is not a lot of capacity left in Dubai, and . . . the UAE now has Abu Dhabi to grow,” he said.\n\nDubai International airport, which is an hour’s drive from Abu Dhabi, handled 87mn passengers in 2023. Executives at its biggest airline Emirates said it could soon run out of space there. A new airport capable of handling up to 230mn people a year is being built but will not be open for years.\n\nSince he was appointed in 2022, Neves has steered away from direct competition with Emirates and Qatar Airways on “ultra-long-haul” flights that link cities like New York and Sydney via one stop in the Gulf.\n\n“That’s not my fight . . . other airlines like Emirates do it very well,” he said.\n\nInstead, Etihad has focused on opening up new markets, putting on multiple flights a day to destinations such as Mumbai, Oman and Riyadh that are between one to three hours from Abu Dhabi.\n\nNeves said he was confident that a global shortage of aircraft and spare parts means there is little danger of overexpansion.\n\n“Impossible, there are no planes,” he said. “The market is so artificially constrained . . . I was at a conference today and a guy said ‘can you sell me a plane’?”\n\nEtihad’s owner ADQ is considering listing the airline via an initial public offering in Abu Dhabi. Neves said there were “pros and cons to any listing”, but that the airline’s $7bn expansion plan was not reliant on external capital.\n\n“I need to be ready. That’s driven by management. The time of the IPO is driven by the shareholder. Because we don’t need cash,” he said.\n\nAirlines flying into the Middle East have cancelled some flights to Beirut and Tel Aviv in recent weeks as the conflict between Israel and Hizbollah in Lebanon has escalated.\n\nNeves said the airline, which has suspended flights to Beirut, relied on its own risk assessments and external intelligence when deciding whether it was safe to run flights.\n\n“It is a process which is common in most airlines. But each has a different perception of risk.”",

    "date": "2024-10-1100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Iran has urged oil-rich Gulf states to remain “neutral” after Tehran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel last week, as it pursues a diplomatic drive in the region amid fears that the Middle East is sliding to all-out war.\n\nThe Islamic republic has cautioned its Arab neighbours, who worry about getting caught in the crossfire, not to “facilitate” an Israeli response such as allowing Israel’s war planes to use their airspace, said an Iranian official.\n\nA flurry of regional diplomacy came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government vowed a “deadly” response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack and intensified its offensive against Hizbollah in Lebanon.\n\nBut Riyadh and Abu Dhabi in particular worry that if Iran feels it is under grave threat, it could lash out at them, potentially striking their oil infrastructure if Israel targets the republic’s energy facilities.\n\n“The Iranians could threaten to hit the Saudi oil infrastructure, so that is a concern. The kingdom doesn’t want an escalation, but it is prepared for that eventuality,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court.\n\nIran was seeking to maintain a fragile rapprochement with arch-rivals such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, delivering the message that they should discuss their “differences” and “misunderstandings” to resolve regional issues, said Arab and Iranian officials.\n\n“It’s a tricky situation for Saudi Arabia, and the Iranians know that. There’s a balance between Israel degrading Hizbollah and Iran, and things getting out of control,” Shihabi said.\n\nBoth Iran and Gulf states are keen to keep diplomatic channels open as the regional crisis intensifies. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman this week held talks with Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, who made a rare trip to Riyadh to discuss the “latest regional developments”, the Saudi state news agency said.\n\nAraghchi then flew to Qatar, which has good relations with Tehran, while also hosting the US’s biggest military base in the Middle East.\n\nLast week the Iranian diplomat held talks with Gulf foreign ministers on the sidelines of a meeting of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council in Doha — the first time in years that such talks had taken place at a GCC gathering. Two Arab officials described the meeting as “conciliatory” and “co-operative”.\n\nThe Iranian official said Tehran had not threatened Gulf states. But he said the message was twofold: “persuading them to help them bring a ceasefire in the region, and warning them that if Israel attacks Iran they should not in any way facilitate that attack”.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE have for several years sought to calm their long-running acrimony with Iran. But they still view the Islamic regime as a malign actor in the region and are wary of the threat it poses.\n\nIn 2019 — as the Gulf powerhouses backed former US president Donald Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic republic — Iran was blamed for a missile and drone assault that temporarily knocked out half of Saudi Arabia’s oil output, as well as the sabotage attacks on two tankers in the Gulf.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia restored diplomatic relations in March 2023, establishing a cold peace between the two adversaries. It has also been seeking to extract itself from its conflict with the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, a major point of friction.\n\nBoth Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have sought to remain on the sidelines of the wave of regional hostilities that erupted after Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. They have pressed for a ceasefire, while joining other Muslim states in condemning Israel’s conduct of its war.\n\nSince the Hamas attack triggered war with Israel, the UAE has cautioned Washington that it did not want any US assets in the Gulf state to be used against Iranian targets.\n\nThat reflected concern in Abu Dhabi about the degree to which the US would commit to defend the UAE from any subsequent counterstrike from Iran or the Houthis.\n\nFor similar reasons, neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia joined a US-led maritime task force that has attempted to counter Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.\n\n“As long as the Americans are hedging on their security commitments to the region, the region will have to hedge to protect itself,” said a person familiar with the UAE’s thinking.\n\nRiyadh did, however, provide assistance to the US as American forces and their allies intercepted missiles that Iran fired at Israel in April, western diplomats said. It is not clear what that entailed.\n\n“They are caught between the two regional bullies, Israel and Iran, with neither appealing to their visions of the region,” said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House.\n\nIsrael’s relentless pounding of Hizbollah — Iran’s most powerful proxy — has exemplified the bind in which the two states find themselves, she added.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE have long considered Hizbollah a “terrorist” organisation. They see it as a destabilising force, not just in Lebanon but across the region, and it serves their interests to see the group weakened.\n\nThey accuse the militant movement of training and supporting the Houthis — who in the past have fired missiles and drones at Saudi Arabia and the UAE — and stoking instability among Shia populations in their countries.\n\nThe Gulf states and Hizbollah were also on opposing sides in Syria’s civil war, with the former backing Sunni rebels and the latter fighting alongside Iranian and Russian forces in support of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nIn 2017, Riyadh warned it would treat Lebanon — which historically received billions of dollars in Gulf aid — as a hostile state as long as Hizbollah remained in its government.\n\nThe Saudis and Emiratis have for years fretted about the Shia group’s dominance over Lebanese politics at the expense of the Sunni parties they traditionally backed, reducing Riyadh’s political influence in Beirut.\n\nBut the concern in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi is the destabilising impact of Israel’s expanding offensive.\n\n“There is no love lost between Hizbollah and Saudi, but Lebanon is a sovereign state and this is a very dangerous precedent that the Israelis are setting. They are making it complicated for everybody,” a Saudi official said.\n\nThe official said Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon “have created a growing sense of anger [in the Arab world]”.\n\n“So the question is can anyone take the political step of making a compromise? At the moment it is down to Israel.”\n\nAbdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati politics professor, said the Gulf also worried about emboldening Netanyahu and his far-right allies in Israel.\n\n“We benefit from [Israel] weakening Iran and its proxies but we see the cost of emboldening Netanyahu,” he said “We’re entrapped in this . . . We have two devils. One is just as bad as the other.”",

    "body": "Richard Desmond, one of Britain’s best-known Fleet Street moguls, has obtained a golden visa in Dubai for “lifestyle” reasons, joining a growing number of wealthy foreigners in the tax-friendly Gulf states.\n\nThe 72-year-old British millionaire received the United Arab Emirates visa this summer after buying a house in Dubai, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nDesmond will continue to be a UK taxpayer both personally and through his UK-based company, said one of the people. The decision was a “lifestyle choice”, given the “better climate” both in terms of weather and business environment, the person said. The move comes as he was “diversifying” his portfolio with company investments and overseas property.\n\nA spokesman for Desmond declined to comment.\n\nThe move is likely to fuel anxiety that the UK has stopped being a welcoming and stable destination for entrepreneurs and the wealthy since the Brexit referendum.\n\nDesmond, who previously owned tabloid newspapers including the Daily Express and the Daily Star, will now split his time between Dubai and London, according to the two people with knowledge of his plans. He intends to keep his family home near Hampstead and his City offices in the Northern & Shell Building overlooking the river Thames.\n\nOne of the people pointed to the “doom and gloom” among entrepreneurs since the Labour party entered government. Desmond has been equally frustrated with the state of the Conservative government in power when he started to consider the move, the person noted however.\n\nHe has “lost confidence in British politics”, said the person. “He likes being in the UK and will spend a lot of his time here but is an entrepreneur at heart — and he sees the opportunities now over in Dubai.”\n\nA growing numbers of wealthy UK individuals are examining whether to move abroad for various reasons, including taxation under the newly elected Labour government. Entrepreneurs and private equity financiers are notably concerned about the prospect of higher taxes on capital gains.\n\nThe abolition of the generous UK “non-dom” regime that allowed expatriates to avoid paying tax on overseas income has also prompted wealthy foreigners to relocate to tax-friendlier jurisdictions. Countries including the UAE, Italy and Switzerland are jostling to attract mobile high-net-worth individuals and their families, including through tax breaks.\n\nOnce the biggest donor to Nigel Farage’s UK Independence party ahead of the Brexit referendum, Desmond has also donated to the Labour party in the past, and allowed his newspapers to switch between Labour and the Conservatives — often whichever was in power.\n\nDubai has enjoyed strong momentum after being one of the earlier cities to reopen its economy following a tough lockdown in the Covid-19 pandemic, pitching itself as a safe place to holiday and work for foreigners. Investing the equivalent of $500,000, being an entrepreneur or just having a special skillset is usually enough to secure UAE residency.\n\nDesmond’s company, Northern & Shell, lost out in 2022 on the licence to run the national lottery to the Czech-owned Allwyn, which has led to ongoing legal action by the media mogul against the decision-making process.\n\nNorthern & Shell is also the owner of the Health Lottery, which since its launch in 2011 has raised more than £130mn for 3,400 local health projects across the UK.\n\nDesmond has also spent many years trying to redevelop the Westferry Printworks site on the Thames. This summer, after eight years and three attempts, Northern & Shell secured planning approval by Tower Hamlets Council for a £1bn residential development in east London.\n\nAdditional reporting by Chloe Cornish in Dubai",

    "body": "Nuveen is set to open its first Middle East office in Abu Dhabi, making it the second investor with over $1tn in assets to announce a bet on the fledgling financial hub this month.\n\nThe oil-rich emirate, which is home to sovereign wealth funds worth at least $1.5tn, is wagering that attracting financial services firms to the city will further diversify its economy and wean it off fossil fuel revenues.\n\nNuveen, the wholly-owned subsidiary of US teachers pension fund TIAA with $1.2tn in assets under management, will initially open a three-person office to deal with its institutional clients in the region. It will be led by former Columbia Threadneedle Middle East managing director Fadi Khoury.\n\nThe head of Nuveen’s global client group Mike Perry said contributing to the expansion of Abu Dhabi’s financial centre would give the asset manager a competitive advantage.\n\nAbu Dhabi’s “whole financial marketplace is getting much more complex and built out. It isn’t just flying in and flying out for one client and one pool of capital”, Perry told the Financial Times.\n\n“We’re hitting this inflection point where, if you’re going to win over time, I think you need to be there to help that marketplace grow, be along for the ride,” he said.\n\nNuveen is the second large US asset manager to announce a new Abu Dhabi office this month, following PGIM less than two weeks ago.\n\nThe group has registered with and obtained a licence from offshore financial centre Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), which says it now hosts 112 fund and asset managers. It has not disclosed the amount of assets being managed within the financial centre.\n\nAlthough competition is mounting from Abu Dhabi, neighbouring emirate Dubai is still the region’s biggest financial hub. The Dubai International Financial Centre says $165bn worth of assets are managed within it.\n\nThe Gulf region’s largest economy, Saudi Arabia, is also trying to bulk up its financial centre, aiming to get so-called suitcase bankers to relocate to Riyadh.\n\nBut Perry said Nuveen chose to open its first Middle East office in Abu Dhabi, which markets itself as the “Capital of Capital”, because its major clients in the region are there.\n\n“I wouldn’t say that there was any kind of enticement [from Abu Dhabi] aside from just being easy to do business,” Perry said.\n\nBut he said that whether Nuveen bulks up its Abu Dhabi office will be down to whether it starts investing in the region, in assets like real estate, rather than just managing relationships with clients.\n\n“The real question is whether we invest in the ground there with assets,” Perry said. “That’s more opportunistic and that is likely what would lead to a larger footprint there.”\n\nNuveen’s Middle East clients are looking to diversify away from traditional assets, Perry said, with high demand for credit from levered finance to energy transition debt. “The private debt, higher yielding space is where we’re seeing a lot of interest,” he said.",

    "body": "The United Arab Emirates’ leader met US President Joe Biden in Washington on Monday to advance artificial intelligence co-operation as the Gulf nation tries to secure easier access to US-made technology.\n\nThe meeting comes during Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan’s first official trip to the US in seven years and underscores his determination to win White House support in his efforts to transform the UAE into an AI leader.\n\nAs well as discussing technology and trade, Biden said the UAE would now have “major defense partner” status along with India, to foster greater security ties through measures such as joint military training and exercises.\n\nThe UAE is one of the US’s most important allies in the Middle East, but relations have been strained at times in recent years. Talks for a formal security pact with Washington have stalled, and Abu Dhabi was infuriated by what it saw as a lukewarm US response to attacks on the UAE’s capital by Houthi rebels from Yemen in 2022.\n\nYet AI has brought new energy to the relationship. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi has made AI central to its plan to wean itself off fossil fuel exports and has taken a strategic decision to work with US companies producing cutting-edge technology.\n\n“AI and new changes in cloud computing, etc, are going to change the way the world looks,” Anwar Gargash, Sheikh Mohamed’s diplomatic adviser, said in Dubai last week. “We cannot let this sort of wave of technological breakthroughs pass by us.\n\n“If we believe that hydrocarbon is on the way out, slowly but surely, then we have to replace the revenue stream through something else,” he added.\n\nHowever, the US last year added the Gulf states to a list of countries restricted from freely importing cutting-edge US-made AI chips over concerns about technology leaks to China. This means companies have to apply for licences to export the chips, and the process has held up some UAE companies’ AI plans.\n\nThe presidents instructed officials to develop a memorandum of understanding on AI co-operation, the next step in formalising the partnership. But they also sketched out several broad areas for collaboration, including supporting bilateral investment and “efficient licensing”.\n\nOne person briefed on the UAE’s plans said the Gulf state had wanted to sketch out a “road map” ahead of the upcoming US election “so that progress is locked in . . . whatever president assumes office in January”.\n\nThe person added officials were aiming to get the UAE’s export designation changed so it would be easier to get hold of chips.\n\nBrad Smith, president of Microsoft, which invested $1.5bn in the UAE’s most important AI group G42 in April, told the Financial Times last week that clarity over the export controls was “emerging”, but it had “taken several months to work through”.\n\nSmith added that export applications by Microsoft and other technology companies were not fully complete but were “getting very close”.\n\nIn a sign of the UAE’s drive to deepen relationships with US companies, G42 announced last week that it was working with Nvidia, the US company that makes chips critical for AI, on a weather forecasting initiative.\n\nUS companies looking to finance expensive AI projects have also welcomed Abu Dhabi’s petrodollars.\n\nMGX, a new Abu Dhabi investment vehicle dedicated to AI, last week announced it was joining asset manager BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Microsoft to launch a $30bn fund to invest in data centres and the energy to power them.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE’s national security adviser and chair of G42, visited Washington in June and has spearheaded the UAE’s efforts to secure US backing for its AI ambitions.\n\nThe FT previously reported that OpenAI founder Sam Altman and Sheikh Tahnoon were in discussions to finance an ambitious chipmaking project.\n\nGargash said Sheikh Tahnoon had “a good understanding of tech”, suggesting this could help the UAE’s negotiations with US officials and executives. “When he sits with somebody like Altman or whatever, he’s really talking his language,” Gargash said.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon attended the meeting between Biden and Sheikh Mohamed.",

    "body": "Emirati student Shaima lives in Abu Dhabi with her four siblings and parents. But she says her seven-person household is small — her father grew up alongside 11 brothers and sisters in the days when the region’s families were legendarily large.\n\nThe generational downsizing in the 21-year-old’s family reflects a dramatic social shift across the United Arab Emirates: Emirati women bear about half the number of children their grandmothers did in 1970, with the fertility rate down from 6.7 per woman in 1970 to 3.7 by 2017, according to official data.\n\nIn a country that lures millions of migrant workers to power an economy that has grown at breakneck speed since the 1960s, the trend has prompted many Emiratis to worry that they belong to a dwindling minority in their own country — and spurred authorities to offer more support designed to encourage large families.\n\n“Us Emiratis are a minority in our own country,” said Shaima, who called the trend “upsetting”. Expatriates form 93.5 per cent of the UAE population of about 9.5mn, according to the UN.\n\n“Why is demographics a sensitive issue?” said William Guéraiche, associate professor at the University of Wollongong in Dubai. “Because this imbalance will grow between the Emiratis and foreigners, and Emiratis feel more and more under siege, rightly or not. But this is the general perception, and the authorities have to deal with that.”\n\nThe Emirati fertility rate, which government figures put at 3.2 in 2021, has halved in the past two decades, according to Luca Maria Pesando, associate professor of social research and public policy at NYU Abu Dhabi. He described the drop as “very fast for a demographic transition”.\n\nAlthough 3.2 exceeds the so-called replacement rate of 2.1 live births per woman, meaning the number of Emiratis is not falling, the authorities are concerned about the speed of the decline, said Pesando, who is working on plans to open a state-funded demographics research centre at NYU Abu Dhabi. “If this has halved [in 20 years], maybe it can halve again,” he added.\n\nOne former Emirati official said it was almost inevitable the Emirati minority would dwindle as a proportion of the resident population.\n\n“If we are successful in . . . attracting more people into the country, this automatically diminishes us as a percentage,” he said. “How do you counter that? Encourage people to have more kids.”\n\nThe government has traditionally offered generous subsidies to local families, from grants and loans for housing and weddings to marriage counselling and help with childcare.\n\nBut a new “Emirati Family Growth Support Programme” in Abu Dhabi, the emirate which includes the UAE’s capital city, focuses on family size, with incentives such as reduced loan debt on the birth of a fourth, fifth and sixth child.\n\nThe government wants Emirati families to “grow their numbers because they play a vital role in achieving social stability and preserving national identity”, said Hamad Ali Al Dhaheri, under-secretary of Abu Dhabi’s community development department.\n\nThe UAE does not publish detailed national statistics on population composition. But data from Dubai, the region’s business and tourism hub, shows expat population growth still outpacing that of locals. While the number of Emiratis in Dubai increased 31 per cent between 2015 and 2023, the number of foreigners rose by 46 per cent.\n\nExpatriates are largely transient and have scant chance of becoming Emirati citizens, but the UAE has in recent years offered longer-term visas and encouraged foreigners to buy property and invest in businesses.\n\nThe Emirates are expecting a further influx of overseas workers as they pursue ambitious plans for the economy, with Dubai alone forecasting a population of 5.8mn people by 2040, from around 3.5mn now.\n\nThe millions of migrant workers, from domestic help to oil engineers and finance professionals, have helped drive rapid growth since Abu Dhabi started exporting oil in the 1960s and Dubai established itself as a trading hub. In just a few decades the country has moved from a largely impoverished tribal society to enjoying some of the region’s highest living standards.\n\nBy 2023 the UAE recorded the Middle East’s second biggest gross domestic product per capita, according to the World Bank.\n\nBut the country’s economic success is a leading factor behind its own slowing birth rate, according to observers. Some Emiratis say rising living costs discourage them from having more children. A government worker and mother of one said she was not planning to have more because of the expense of childcare, including education costs.\n\nAcademics also argue that smaller families are partly driven by the UAE’s success in encouraging women to pursue higher education and employment and contribute to the economy, which has led many to delay marriage and having children.\n\nThe UAE has a high proportion of working women compared with the wider region, with 55 per cent of those aged over 15 participating in the labour force. By contrast the average across the Middle East and North Africa is 19 per cent, according to International Labour Organization estimates.\n\nFor 30-year-old Huda, a museum researcher whose mother married at 16 and had nine children, staying at home to raise a family was the last thing she wanted.\n\n“[My generation] were very open to [what we saw in] American and western movies,” she said. “We wanted independence.”\n\nOther UAE policies to help working mothers, such as lengthening statutory maternity leave to 60 days, may not be enough to bring back the big families of the past.\n\n“I know I’m going to be a working mum,” said Shaima, who said she would like four children. “I need to balance between my working life and taking care of my kids. And having a lot of kids is not going to help.”",

    "body": "Imagine a consortium between a) a multitrillion-dollar asset manager whose corporate governance values shift with the wind b) a juggernaut tech company that has faced censure from competition regulators and c) an authoritarian petrostate with a chequered human rights record.\n\nIs this the latest villain to come out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? No, this group is very real. The alliance is planning a $100bn spending spree that is to “enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth”.\n\nThe trio is comprised of BlackRock, Microsoft and MGX, the latter an investment vehicle of Abu Dhabi. The group says it can collectively stump up $30bn of equity capital, which will be leveraged three times to hit total purchasing power, to build out the vast power infrastructure that artificial intelligence will supposedly require. It is one of several private capital attempts to get in on the gold rush.\n\nThe mining is proving to be very expensive, whether for semiconductors, computing power or energy. The result is an arms race between already ultra-dominant players in the economy, who could further entrench their power by controlling the next great technological innovation. Society and regulators should consider if that heralds a happy ending, or a dubious plot development.\n\nThe massive pools of capital that have accumulated around the world have increasingly looked to steadier, long-term investment horizons provided by infrastructure, private credit and a combination of the two. Even before the AI mania of the past two years, electrification, power transmission and distribution, as well as the clean energy transition, were prime targets for asset managers. BlackRock purchased Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5bn precisely to get in on this mega trend.\n\nElectricity demand had been largely flat in the US for several years after the financial crisis. But that is fast changing: the US Energy Department expects a sharp 2.4 per cent compound annual growth rate spike between now and 2030. In particular, the power needs in Texas and Virginia are acute given their heavy concentration of data centres.\n\nWhat was an arms race between the likes of BlackRock, Blackstone, and Brookfield now seems to require latching on to a Big Tech behemoth and perhaps a sovereign wealth fund for good measure. Microsoft argues that AI infrastructure requires efforts that go beyond any single country or company. Maybe we need a superhero antitrust lawyer to scrutinise that proposition before it is too late.\n\nsujeet.indap@ft.com",

    "body": "The $1.3tn asset manager PGIM has become one of the biggest players in its industry to open an office in Abu Dhabi, as the oil-rich emirate seeks to build itself up as a financial hub to rival neighbouring Dubai.\n\nThe arm of New York-listed insurer Prudential Financial announced on Thursday that it was opening an office in the Abu Dhabi Global Market centre, its first in the Middle East.\n\nA number of hedge funds and billionaire family offices have set up in the city, which is home to sovereign wealth funds including the nearly $1tn Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.\n\nAbu Dhabi Global Market’s head of market development Arvind Ramamurthy said PGIM’s arrival would “strengthen ADGM’s position”.\n\nPGIM’s new Middle East head Mohammed Abdulmalek said the move “emphasises our ongoing dedication to our presence in the UAE and our commitment to the Middle East”, and he described Abu Dhabi as a key market for PGIM. The asset manager said it had secured a licence to operate in ADGM.\n\n“Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds along with other institutional clients and evolving family offices are looking for partners who can support them as they strive to deepen the local capital markets and become more than providers of capital to the rest of the world,” said David Hunt, PGIM’s CEO. “It’s important to be close to our partners to work most effectively with them as they achieve these goals.”\n\nFor years, global money managers served Gulf clients from offices in Europe, North America or the regional financial hub of Dubai.\n\nAbu Dhabi wants to attract some of that business as it tries to diversify its economy and lessen its dependence on oil. It has sought to convince money managers they will have a better chance of raising funds in the oil-rich state if they demonstrate their commitment there, including by opening offices in the UAE capital.\n\nIt is also aiming to draw finance professionals with low taxes, as well as private schools and healthcare.\n\nOther major asset managers have a presence in Abu Dhabi too. ADGM said last month that 112 asset and fund managers now operate there, and that firms including Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners and Morgan Stanley have obtained licences. BlackRock registered two “Middle East infrastructure” funds at ADGM last year, the centre’s registry shows.\n\nBillionaires have also set up shop. Ray Dalio, the founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, has opened a family office in Abu Dhabi, while former Apollo Global Management chief executive Leon Black this week announced a new Abu Dhabi branch of his family office Elysium.\n\nThis article has been corrected. BlackRock has registered funds in Abu Dhabi but has not opened an office there.",

    "date": "2024-09-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Opec+ members have agreed to delay planned increases to oil production for at least two months as the group continues its battle to prop up prices that have fallen to their lowest levels this year.\n\nEight members of the producer group, including Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, were due to begin unwinding voluntary output cuts from the start of October but the curbs will now remain in place until December 1, they said in a joint statement after a virtual meeting on Thursday.\n\nThe planned increases would have lifted the group’s production by 180,000 barrels a day in October and by 540,000 b/d by the end of the year, as part of plans for a gradual unwinding of 2.2mn of voluntary cuts over the next 12 months.\n\n“Opec+ have always stated they will adjust their policy depending on market conditions and that is exactly what they did as demand indications recently have been weak,” said Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects, a consultancy.\n\nOpec+ members announced the plan to bring back output after its last meeting in June, even as it agreed to extend other production cuts to the end of 2025.\n\nThe group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, has repeatedly curbed oil output in recent years in an attempt to prop up prices.\n\nThree different sets of cuts mean Opec+ members are currently producing almost 6mn b/d less than their combined capacity, representing about 6 per cent of global supply.\n\nSaudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman in June said the plan to finally roll back some of the curbs could be halted at any time if market conditions soured.\n\nOn Wednesday Brent crude closed at $72.70 a barrel, the lowest since May 2023, as soft demand in China and the possible resolution of a dispute in Libya that has halted oil exports further weighed on prices. On Thursday it was up 0.1 per cent at $72.74.\n\nHelima Croft, head of commodities research at RBC Capital Markets, said the production increases could easily be delayed again in December. “It’s another ‘to be determined’” she said. “It gives them breathing room.”\n\nIn the statement, Opec+ said it retained “the flexibility to pause or reverse” the planned production increases “as necessary”. It added that Iraq and Kazakhstan had failed to adhere to all of the cuts, pumping more oil than agreed since January 2024. Both countries reaffirmed their commitment to now produce less than their agreed quotas to compensate, it said.\n\nThe group’s next in-person meeting is scheduled for December 1 in Vienna, which will allow the members to meet and then communicate any decision in person.\n\n“I think the communication mechanism of the public press conference remains important for market sentiment,” Croft said. “Written statements can become a kind of Rorschach test where everyone sees what they want to see in the ink blots of the communique.”",

    "blurb": "Regional powers boost diplomatic and trade links with Islamist group as they fear spread of instability",
    "date": "2024-09-0400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Afghanistan’s Taliban have racked up a series of diplomatic victories in recent weeks, with the United Arab Emirates’ acceptance of their ambassador exposing a global rift over how to deal with the hardline regime.\n\nThe wealthy Gulf state has joined a small but growing number of regional powers building ties with the Taliban despite western efforts to isolate the Islamist group in the three years since it toppled Afghanistan’s Nato-backed government. Kazakhstan last month accepted a Taliban-appointed charge d’affaires, while Uzbekistan’s prime minister visited Kabul in the highest-level foreign visit to the country since the Taliban takeover.\n\n“The Taliban are hungry for international engagement and hungry for recognition,” said Hasan Alhasan, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain. The UAE’s decision to engage “carries a lot of weight” with the Taliban, he added.\n\nThe US and other western countries have enforced sanctions and sought to punish the Taliban over their crackdown on women’s rights and amid fears they are sheltering extremists.\n\nBut Middle Eastern and Asian powers increasingly see engagement as a practical necessity, analysts said. Although no country has formally recognised the Taliban government, the Islamist group says it has diplomats in about a dozen countries including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n\nA Taliban delegation attended the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia this week, according to Russian state news agency Tass, while Moscow has also taken steps towards lifting the group’s terrorist designation.\n\nOther countries, including India, have also built limited ties with the regime in Kabul.\n\nAfghanistan’s neighbours “are mobilising to make sure that instability does not spread across the region”, said Kabir Taneja, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. “Fortunately or unfortunately, the only entity in helping with that is the Taliban.\n\n“The Taliban may not be the most astute diplomats, but they have been able to take advantage of the global situation,” he added.\n\nA UAE official said the decision to accept a Taliban ambassador would help build “bridges to help the people of Afghanistan”.\n\nThis included providing aid and “supporting efforts that work towards regional de-escalation and stability”, the official added.\n\nThe growing regional acceptance is providing the Taliban with trade and investment opportunities at a time when the country of 40mn faces an economic and humanitarian crisis. Companies from nearby countries have secured deals to build infrastructure in Afghanistan, which is strategically placed between central and south Asian trade routes.\n\nThe Taliban have issued dozens of contracts for exploitation of the country’s estimated $1tn of untapped mineral wealth, which includes reserves of copper and lithium. Some have gone to investors from Iran, Turkey and China, which also pledged to include Afghanistan in its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\n\nAn Abu Dhabi company won contracts to manage Afghan airports in 2022, beating a Qatari-Turkish consortium, and there are now regular flights between Kabul and the UAE. “I hear regional officials say things like, ‘The world is changing, the Americans aren’t the boss of everything any more,’” said Graeme Smith, a senior consultant at Crisis Group. “Afghanistan is emblematic of that for these middle powers.”\n\nThe Taliban have sought to dispel international misgivings about their rule, saying they are open to engagement and investment. “Our policy is to have good relations with all,” Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, told the Financial Times.\n\nShortly after taking power, the Taliban vowed to break with the practices that made their first rule in the 1990s notorious, including a ban on girls’ education and hosting extremists such as al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, whose role in plotting the September 11 attacks from the country prompted the Nato invasion in 2001.\n\nBut the Taliban have again barred girls from school, and bin Laden’s successor Ayman al-Zawahiri lived in central Kabul until his death in a US drone strike in 2022. The Taliban last month ratified a law that banned women from showing their faces and speaking in public.\n\nFor most North American and European governments, this has largely scuppered hopes of meaningful engagement. Germany, which has no diplomatic relations with the Taliban, last week deported 28 convicted Afghan criminals back to the country for the first time.\n\nSome in the region argue that isolation and sanctions are exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that only worsens the plight of Afghanistan’s women and gives the Taliban little incentive to change.\n\n“The American approach to Afghanistan is, ‘Keep it out of the news, it has been a 20-year embarrassment’ . . . in the UK, the discussion is similar,” one diplomat said. “It’s much easier to sit back and condemn them for being misogynist.”\n\nThat is harder for countries in the region, which are more vulnerable to violence spilling over their borders. The UN has estimated that hundreds of al-Qaeda members are in Afghanistan alongside other militants such as the Uyghur Turkistan Islamic party and Isis-K, the Afghanistan-based offshoot of the Middle Eastern terror group.\n\nFor the UAE, security “prompts them to view engagement with the Taliban as necessary”, said Giorgio Cafiero, chief executive of Washington-based risk consultancy Gulf State Analytics. “[This] is simply about Abu Dhabi being pragmatic and making the most of the situation in Afghanistan.”\n\nYet some analysts warned that trusting the Taliban could prove a costly mistake.\n\nPakistan was one of the earliest advocates for global engagement with Taliban-run Kabul but suffered a dramatic surge in militant violence by groups including the Taliban’s Pakistani offshoot, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.\n\nThe Taliban’s unwillingness — or inability — to stop them led to a sharp deterioration in relations, with Pakistan even launching air strikes on TTP targets in Afghanistan.\n\nThe diplomat said the limited foreign presence inside Afghanistan meant many countries were still struggling to ascertain the extent of the threat posed by Taliban rule, but the risks remained high. “Obviously the lesson from history is 9/11.”",

    "date": "2024-09-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Dubai crown prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed al-Maktoum has won popularity at home for his thrill-seeking pursuits, from leading mass-participation runs and cycle events to scaling the city’s Burj Khalifa tower.\n\nHis younger brother Sheikh Maktoum keeps a lower profile, preferring to eschew the limelight as he cultivates the image of an astute technocrat.\n\nDubai’s ruling family is counting on the brothers’ different qualities to maintain the development of an emirate that has evolved over the decades from an entrepôt port to a global trade, tourism and financial centre.\n\nTheir abilities are moving more into focus as their father, Dubai ruler and United Arab Emirates prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, gradually steps back from frontline decision-making. The 75-year-old is now regularly photographed walking with a cane, as the ground is prepared for the eventual succession of Hamdan.\n\n“Sheikh Mohammed’s still in the driver’s seat,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a Dubai-based political scientist. “But the co-pilots have taken more responsibility.”\n\nHamdan, 41, and Maktoum, 40, were in their 20s when they were appointed heir apparent and deputy ruler respectively, with a view to eventually taking over the day-to-day running of Dubai from their father.\n\n“Hamdan is seen as the chief marketing officer [in charge of] new investments, tourism and promoting Dubai,” said one emirate-based chief executive. “Maktoum is the money man, he’s more serious.”\n\nThe succession planning moved up a gear in July as Hamdan joined the federal government as deputy prime minister. He also stepped into the largely ceremonial role of defence minister held by his father since 1971. Maktoum has been UAE finance minister and a deputy prime minister since 2021.\n\nThe brothers’ partnership is part of a new generation of leaders emerging in the Gulf. After Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan became UAE president last year he appointed his eldest son Sheikh Khaled as crown prince and promoted his own brothers.\n\nManaging the power balance between Abu Dhabi, the cash-rich Emirati capital, and the more entrepreneurial Dubai is a task that will increasingly rest on the shoulders of the younger cohort.\n\nDubai’s latest revival started amid the coronavirus pandemic after it reopened its tourism and services-based economy faster than other cities.\n\nThe highest profile of the seven emirates that make up the UAE, the city became a magnet for wealthy tech and crypto investors, social media influencers and remote workers fleeing lockdowns elsewhere. Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 sparked a further influx of Russians relocated by multinational companies, seeking to avoid the impact of western sanctions, or avoid the draft.\n\nDubai’s total population grew 9 per cent between 2019 and 2023, according to government estimates, hitting 3.7mn. The expanding ranks of expatriates helped generated Dubai’s third property surge this century, following the growth of the early 2000s.\n\nThat earlier boom ended nine years later amid the global financial crisis, when Dubai used more than $20bn in bailout loans from Abu Dhabi to avoid default. During the Arab uprisings of 2011, Dubai was seen as a safe haven for regional wealth, sparking a growth spurt that lasted until oil prices collapsed in 2014.\n\nMaktoum, the “money man”, has been quietly using the proceeds from privatisations and growing tax revenues to pay down Dubai’s estimated $100bn-plus in bonds and loans — built up during the debt-fulled boom of the 2000s — and put the emirate’s finances on a more sustainable footing.\n\nSome of this has come from Dubai’s capital markets strategy, through which it is listing state-related entities to boost liquidity and compete more effectively with larger bourses in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.\n\nWhen he took effective power in 1995, Sheikh Mohammed turned Dubai into a global metropolis by boosting trade, developing infrastructure to attract investment and opening up new sectors in real estate, media and finance.\n\nSheikh Mohammed’s advisers continue to wield influence, but they are gradually being eclipsed by Hamdan and Maktoum aides such as Mohammed al-Hussaini, minister of state for financial affairs, and Helal al-Marri, who heads Dubai’s economic and tourist departments.\n\n“Hussaini reflects prudence, financial management and discipline,” said Nasser al-Shaikh, former director-general of Dubai’s department of finance. “Marri reflects the growth agenda.”\n\nHussaini is a board member at Dubai’s national bank Emirates NBD and the $320bn Investment Corporation of Dubai that oversees state holdings in the city’s leading companies.\n\nAt the finance ministry, he is overseeing the UAE’s introduction of a 9 per cent corporate tax rate, which along with the sales tax of 5 per cent introduced in 2018 is expected to bring the government substantial revenues. However, analysts have warned that the levies will need careful management to avoid deterring investors previously attracted by the country’s tax-free status.\n\nMarri, who is also on the ICD board, chairs the domestic stock market and is leading Dubai’s drive to become a cryptocurrency hub and to double the economy’s size by 2033.\n\nThe UK-trained chartered accountant, who has worked at KPMG and McKinsey, is seen as a bridge into the international business community. “When you have an issue, you go to Helal,” said a senior banker.\n\nYet although many Emiratis acknowledge the new leadership’s effectiveness and commitment to fiscal prudence, the new era has ushered in an air of uncertainty.\n\n“This feels like limbo,” said an Emirati businessman. “There’s a lot of confidence in them, but the new crew are also somewhat unknown.”\n\nAnd despite the brothers’ growing influence, many businesspeople still believe it is their father who calls the shots. As one Dubai magnate said: “Sheikh Mohammed’s still in charge”.",

    "body": "Sitting astride a motorbike near a Dubai kitchen, sweat forms on Mohamad’s brow as he waits to collect a lunch order. The food is not for him; he’ll drive it through the sweltering financial and tourist hub to a customer in an air-conditioned tower block.\n\nWith the mercury nudging 44C and high humidity, “it feels like a sauna”, the delivery driver says. Originally from Pakistan, Mohamad is uncomfortably dressed for the weather, wearing protective pads, dark trousers and the branded long-sleeved, high-neck top supplied by the delivery platform he works with.\n\nFrom July to early September, Dubai’s streets are so hot and sticky that the “heat index”, a combination of air temperature and moisture levels, regularly exceeds 50C.\n\nLast month, temperatures in the forties and humidity levels of 80 per cent or more resulted in a “feels like” temperature of 62C by midday at Dubai International Airport, US National Weather Service records show.\n\nThe Gulf is one of many regions learning how to live with extreme heat. Indian authorities have reported more than 40,000 cases of suspected heatstroke during a prolonged heatwave, and at least 110 deaths.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia this year, 1,301 pilgrims died after walking in temperatures that rose to nearly 50C during the hajj.\n\nBut individual experiences of the searing heat vary according to wealth. While Mohamad and thousands of other mainly foreign workers swelter in the open, the Gulf’s vast hydrocarbon wealth has allowed its better-off residents to luxuriate in western-style cities that defy the inhospitable desert.\n\nMany of Dubai’s upwardly mobile still jet off to cooler climes during the peak of the heat, but those who remain can avail themselves of facilities that keep them indoors during the hottest parts of the day.\n\nDubai has ice rinks and an indoor ski slope, while emperor penguins and Arctic foxes live in Abu Dhabi’s SeaWorld, a vast indoor theme park. In the region’s shopping malls, the air is so chilly that one Dubai expat carries a jumper with her while shopping during summer, and says she looks forward to winter so she “can be warm again”.\n\nThose determined to brave the blazing summer sun can swim in outdoor pools filled with chilled water or jog around the 1.14km air-conditioned outdoor path in Qatar’s Umm Al Seneem park.\n\nBut the differing experiences of the well-off and the labourers, security guards and parking attendants that keep the Gulf functioning show how extreme climate risks entrenching and exacerbating inequality.\n\nAs the world warms, the region may serve as a lesson on how — or how not — to deal with scorching temperatures in urban environments which are home to tens of millions of people.\n\n“Right now what you’re seeing in the Gulf countries is what you’re going to see in many parts of southern Europe, or the southern US, or in parts of India and Bangladesh,” says Barrak Alahmad, a research fellow at Harvard University’s TH Chan School of Public Health.\n\n“This is the opportunity for the Gulf countries to actually lead the field [in heat safety]. And I think it’s a missed opportunity.”\n\nThe region in which the modern United Arab Emirates sits has been called “the land of the empty bucket”, because of the rapid evaporation of water.\n\n“By and large, the region lacks the three fundamentals of human settlements” of water supply, an agricultural hinterland and a moderate climate, says Karim Elgendy, an associate fellow at London-based Chatham House who specialises in urban sustainability in the region. For centuries, the absence of such basics put a cap on the region’s growth.\n\nPetrodollars changed all that, allowing many Gulf states to buy expensive technology like desalination units and air conditioners and to import more food. “Those financial resources have enabled [Gulf societies] to live despite their climate, not in harmony with [it],” says Elgendy.\n\nHaving overcome nature, and with the hydrocarbon industry booming, the population of the Gulf Cooperation Council states exploded from under 4mn people in 1950 to nearly 30mn by 2000, according to UN estimates. It then almost doubled again to reach 58mn by 2019.\n\nCities in the Gulf expanded on the back of fossil fuel exports. But the emissions from burning those fuels have contributed to the climate change that has made the region’s summer heat ever more intense.\n\n“The Gulf region is already uninhabitable in summer without cooling systems,” says Diana Francis, assistant professor of earth sciences at Abu Dhabi’s Khalifa University.\n\nBut since the region is already equipped to survive under such conditions, “the impact of rising temperatures on the population will be felt less than in other regions where no cooling systems exist”, she says.\n\nA lack of historical data means little is known about how the climate has evolved in the Gulf compared with other regions. But older Emiratis recall a very different environment six or seven decades ago.\n\nGrowing up in Dubai in the 1950s, political scientist Abdulkhaleq Abdulla remembers summers being less hot and shorter. Houses were open, to channel fresh air, some had ventilation towers, and families would sleep on flat roofs.\n\n“One fan for the whole family was enough then,” recalls Abdulla. Today, almost every room in a middle-class Dubai home has air conditioning.\n\n“It appears that over the last 40 years, summer temperatures in the UAE have increased by about 1C,” says Francesco Paparella, an assistant professor at NYU Abu Dhabi and principal investigator at the Mubadala Arabian Center for Climate and Environmental Science. That compares with an average global temperature rise of at least 1.1C since the industrial age began around the 1850s.\n\nRising humidity adds to that. For every 1C increase in temperature, a given volume of air can hold 7 per cent more water vapour. This year, conditions were exacerbated by record sea temperatures in the Gulf, contributing to high humidity levels that affect humans’ ability to cool themselves by sweating.\n\nScientists say the wet bulb temperature, a measure of heat stress, is critical. Most studies suggest that beyond 35C, reached after six hours of exposure to temperatures of more than 40C and a humidity level of 75 per cent, humans can no longer cool themselves down.\n\nResearchers such as Paparella stress that a lack of data makes it hard to forecast what the Gulf’s climate will be in future, although some scientific studies suggest intense rainfall and storms will increase.\n\nIn a “business-as-usual” scenario where the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change are not drastically reduced, researchers estimate that after 50 years, “unprecedented super- and ultra-extreme heatwave conditions will emerge” in the Middle East and north Africa region, he says, with temperatures potentially exceeding 56C.\n\nEven the glittering skyscrapers built by ambitious Gulf leaders are not well adapted to such a worsening climate.\n\nThe glass and steel downtowns — what Elgendy calls “spaceships in the desert” — required large supplies of desalinated water and constant cooling. “When you fully glaze a building, all that heat gets trapped inside and then you need to air-condition it out,” says Elgendy. “It’s a really poor choice.”\n\nBut the region’s cheap and abundant fossil fuel energy meant there was little incentive to find alternative solutions. Cooling accounts for up to 70 per cent of electricity consumption during peak hours in the Gulf states, putting a huge strain on electricity grids.\n\nThe UAE has introduced green building codes “because of the realisation that the kind of buildings we have in the desert cannot be the same as those you find in New York”, says Leonard Chirenje, assistant professor of sustainability sciences at Abu Dhabi’s Zayed University.\n\nTo make air conditioning more efficient, some Gulf countries are also using district cooling, which circulates cold water from a central facility through insulated pipes into buildings rather than relying on individual air conditioning units.\n\nTabreed, the listed Dubai district cooling company, says it supplies services across the region to buildings ranging from the office complexes of Saudi Aramco, the oil and gas giant, to commercial towers on Bahrain’s waterfront. District cooling is also planned for Saudi Arabia’s futuristic Line city, under-construction in Neom.\n\nSome developments have experimented with reviving traditional building techniques. The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence uses clay facades for shade, which have a noticeable cooling effect, on the campus named after the Abu Dhabi ruler.\n\nBut most of the Gulf’s ways of coping with climatic extremes still involve enormous amounts of greenhouse gas-producing energy, notes Paparella. Cheap fossil fuels mean that renewable energy sources are caught “between a rock and a hard place”.\n\nConstruction activity is relentless in the Gulf, as the region builds to accommodate expected further increases in population. Saudi Arabia, the biggest economy in the GCC, is building whole new conurbations such as Neom and New Murabba, a new downtown in Riyadh.\n\nBut research suggests that construction workers, often itinerant labourers from south Asia, are among the most vulnerable to the extreme weather conditions.\n\nData is scarce but in Kuwait, Harvard epidemiologist Alahmad and his colleagues found that non-Kuwaiti men were up to three times more likely to die during extreme heat conditions compared with normal weather, despite the workers generally being young and fit.\n\nAlthough climate is not the only culprit for this vulnerability among migrant workers — they can suffer everything from cramped accommodation to problems getting healthcare — heat is aggravating these issues, Alahmad says.\n\nResearchers, led by Bandana Pradhan from the Institute of Medicine at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan University, concluded that high incidences of fatalities from heart disease among Nepali migrant workers in Qatar during the hot season were “most likely due to severe heat stress”.\n\nOf the 571 Nepalis who died from cardiovascular disease from 2009 to 2017, some 200 could have been saved through “effective heat protection”, their analysis concluded.\n\nQatar and other GCC countries have taken steps to reduce the risks of outdoor work during the summer. All of them now ban outdoor work during the middle of the day, though the hours and dates vary.\n\nSome city authorities go further — the municipality of Dubai, for example, says companies should provide workers with cold water and electrolytes. “It’s a productivity issue,” says one construction company boss, who agrees with the 12.30 to 3pm restriction in the city. “At 50 degrees what is he [the worker] going to do for you?”\n\nHowever, the International Labour Organization says that temperatures can still be “extremely high outside of the banned hours, and limited inspections undermine the policy’s effectiveness”.\n\nThe middle-of-the-day ban is also inflexible and does not take into account other factors that can affect human health, says Alahmad, such as humidity and the task the person is performing.\n\nIronically some of the lowest-paid migrant workers in the Gulf, who bear the brunt of its brutal summers, have left their home countries because of climate change.\n\nLow-lying Bangladesh, the country of origin for millions of construction workers in the Gulf, has been severely hit by changing weather patterns and rising sea levels.\n\nBournemouth University researcher Nirmal Aryal says similar factors are at play in his home country of Nepal, where increasingly unpredictable weather patterns have disrupted the subsistence farming upon which many Nepalis depend.\n\nAryal has been investigating the instance of kidney disease affecting returning migrant workers, although he says there is not yet enough data to definitively blame hot working conditions. The need for evidence, and collaboration with Gulf countries, to study the effect of heat stress on workers is urgent, he says.\n\n“Nepal is a poor country [and] migrant workers are the poorest of the poor,” Aryal says. When workers return home with nephrological diseases, the cost of kidney dialysis has “a significant social and economic impact”.\n\nIn Dubai’s touristy JBR area, a parking assistant hides in the shade of an umbrella. Also called Mohammad, he hails from Kerala in southern India, and came to the UAE nine months ago after his bachelors degree in commerce failed to land him a job.\n\nHe rates his situation “five out of ten — it’s too hot”, but is optimistic his lot will improve with Dubai’s balmy winters. The 27-year-old is one of 3.5mn UAE-based Indians, whose home country is no stranger to blistering heat.\n\nBefore the monsoon rains break India’s summer heat, pedestrians in the coastal commercial centre of Mumbai quickly become drenched in sweat thanks to high humidity and headache-inducing temperatures.\n\nAlthough families in India’s rapidly growing middle class are installing air conditioning units, poorer Indians often remain dependent on fans — both at home and in the Gulf.\n\nZeyed University’s Chirenje, who is originally from Zimbabwe, says climate change and new cooling technologies have opened a Pandora’s box of sociopolitical issues. “Is access to that technology the same for everyone?” he asks. “No, it’s not.”\n\nHe describes the conditions of an African woman he knows, who works as a maid in the UAE. She sleeps in a small room whose air conditioning is connected to the family dining room — but her boss switches that unit off at night, leaving her to sweat and suffer bad sleep.\n\nThose who “have the capacity to adapt — the rich — will continue enjoying,” says Chirenje. “The richer continue becoming richer and the poor will continue becoming poorer, because they cannot adapt.”\n\nMohamad, the delivery rider, knows this only too well. He says the authorities in Dubai have opened rest stops for delivery drivers, but they are far away from the eateries he serves. “We work less in summer because we get too tired and it’s bad for the body,” he adds.\n\n“I have been sick, with fever and body pain . . . heat is very dangerous.”\n\nChloe Cornish is the FT’s Gulf business correspondent.

    "body": "By 5pm, grandmothers in traditional Emirati metallic face coverings, and younger women in glamorous gowns and high heels, had taken their seats around the opulent Abu Dhabi living room. They were unsure what to expect next.\n\nThe women were attending one of the first toned-down weddings that the oil-rich Abu Dhabi government says will better adhere to “authentic Emirati values”. Dubai, the emirate home to the Middle East’s glitzy finance and tourism hub, is trying something similar.\n\nModest wedding initiatives are a rare insight into the tensions between tradition and modernity that permeate Emirati society, which petrodollars and global trade have propelled from impoverishment to riches in barely three generations.\n\nThere’s a demographic factor behind official concern. Rulers want to reverse the trend of fewer weddings, more divorces and fewer babies. While the United Arab Emirates has welcomed foreigners to build its growing cities and develop its economy, migration has made nationals a shrinking minority in their own country, outnumbered by at least nine to one.\n\nHessa Buhumaid, director-general of Dubai’s Community Development Authority, which oversees Dubai’s scheme, said it sought to “help a larger segment of young men and women to marry at an early age, aimed at increasing the number of Emirati families in the country”.\n\nEven as Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah position themselves as wedding destinations for foreigners with cash to splash, anxiety about the ballooning extravagance of Emirati weddings has long simmered. In the early 2000s, anthropologist Jane Bristol-Rhys estimated that Emirati couples invited 800 people on average, in weddings costing about “$280,000”. She describes “monstrous floral arrangements, statuesque ice-carvings, canopies and columns that are in turn decorated with metres of colourful silk and ribbons.”\n\nThe bling level has risen ever since. “I’ve seen planes fly overhead during the end of ceremonies, releasing colour clouds,” one wedding industry insider told the Khaleej Times. “I’ve seen giant 6ft-tall cakes suspended from ceilings.”\n\nSome Emiratis argue that royal families have led the trend for lavish weddings. Last year, the daughter of Dubai’s ruler Sheikha Mahra wed in a diamond necklace, flanked by clouds of white flowers. Like many marriages in the UAE, the union did not last.\n\nEmirati authorities have tried to bring down marriage costs, even offering loans. Decades ago they capped the traditional dowry (mahr), offered by the groom’s family, at Dh50,000 ($14,000). But Abu Dhabi’s “Medeem Model for Women’s Weddings” initiative — the women’s wedding is the event at which female friends and family celebrate a bride — may be the first time the local government has issued detailed guidance in an attempt to change standards.\n\nUnder the Medeem Model and the Dubai Wedding Programme, also introduced this year, Emirati couples will be eligible for loans and subsidies if they opt for scaled-back celebrations, often organised with government-selected event planners and held in specific halls — or better still, a family home. Couples may also undertake counselling, as part of a more holistic approach aiming at stable marriages.\n\nAbu Dhabi’s plan gives a 250-guest and three-hour limit, discourages live entertainment, wasteful buffets and wedding cakes (finger food is fine), and suggests brides choose “a modest and moderate dress that lets [her] shine rather than distracting”.\n\nThe event I attended was held at the groom’s family home and scheduled from 4:30-7pm, in line with the new model. Floral decorations were gorgeous and waitresses circulated with endless canapés. The bride’s dress was spectacular. But there was no DJ, no dancing, no grand cake and no selfies.\n\nAlthough some Emirati women agree that wedding excess has gone too far, others don’t want to see a traditionally fun girls’ night rendered boring. They remind me that the government initiatives are merely suggestions, and there are no rules preventing blowout parties. “I loved the weddings at night, with a DJ,” sighed one guest. “More shiny.”\n\nchloe.cornish@ft.com",

    "blurb": "The $1bn cash injection comes as owner Patrick Drahi’s telco empire is struggling with debts",
    "date": "2024-08-0900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund ADQ is to take a stake in Sotheby’s as part of a $1bn capital injection alongside existing owner Patrick Drahi as the auction house seeks to cut debt and fund growth.\n\nADQ and Sotheby’s said in a joint statement on Friday that the investment fund had “signed a definitive agreement” to buy a minority stake via newly issued shares.\n\nThe cash will be used to “reduce leverage and support the company’s growth and innovation plans,” they said, adding that Drahi would also put in additional money and remain Sotheby’s majority owner. The parties did not provide a valuation for the company.\n\nDrahi acquired Sotheby’s in 2019 in a deal that valued the auction house at $3.7bn, including debt. That the Franco-Israeli entrepreneur is now willing to accept a partner represents a change in position from what people close to him said in December, namely that he did not need to sell nor bring in outside investors.\n\nThe bulk of Drahi’s holdings are in telecoms and owned by his Altice group, although Sotheby’s sits in his personal holding company.\n\nIn June, S&P Global Ratings cut the auction house’s credit rating to B minus from B, citing “pressured profitability and continued Ebitda decline.” The agency highlighted “potential refinancing risk” given Sotheby’s “elevated leverage.”\n\nSotheby’s parent company Bidfair had $3.5bn in long-term debt at the end of last year, according to corporate filings in Luxembourg.\n\nThe deal with ADQ is expected to close before the end of the year. The fund’s involvement is a reflection of how many rich buyers of artwork and collectors’ items increasingly hail from the oil-rich Gulf states.\n\nFounded in 2018, the sovereign wealth fund is tasked with fuelling development in the oil-rich emirate of Abu Dhabi. Chaired by the UAE’s powerful national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, ADQ also invests abroad, and earlier this year announced $35bn investment plans in Egypt.\n\nThe Sotheby’s stake falls outside ADQ’s priority sectors, which span energy to agriculture, healthcare and logistics. However, a person close to the fund said it could lead to a Sotheby’s opening in Abu Dhabi, which has invested heavily in bringing art and culture to the emirate. The Louvre Abu Dhabi opened in 2017, and construction on a Guggenheim gallery has begun.\n\nDrahi has been selling off assets lately as a wall of debt starts looms. His holding company Altice was built during an acquisition spree starting around 2014 that splashed out about €50bn and was partly funded with cheap borrowing. It expanded to include US cable companies, French telecom operator SFR, and other smaller communications groups from Portugal to Israel.\n\nHis deals often used creative financing methods and leverage: the purchase of a 24.5 per cent stake in BT was built through substantial loans and derivatives financing, allowing Altice to borrow heavily against the shares, according to people familiar with the situation and loan documents seen by the Financial Times.\n\nIn November, Altice struck a deal to sell a majority stake in its data centre business in France, valued at €764mn, to a Morgan Stanley infrastructure fund.\n\nIn March, Drahi agreed to sell French 24-hour news channel BFM and RMC radio to Rodolphe Saadé, the billionaire owner of CMA-CGM shipping group, for €1.55bn in cash. This month, Altice sold an online video advertising group called Teads to digital marketing group Outbrain for about $1bn.\n\nOther assets like Portugal Telecom have been on the block for more than a year, but have not found buyers. In Portugal, Altice was rocked by a corruption probe in which one of Drahi’s long-standing lieutenants was alleged to have embezzled money through procurement contracts.\n\nThe company has said it did not know of the problems, and is co-operating with prosecutors.\n\nIn 2023, Sotheby’s parent company based in Luxembourg reported interest expenses of $267mn, from $218mn the previous year.\n\nRevenue fell to $1.36bn in 2023 from $1.4bn the previous year because of lower auction services revenues and a decline in inventory sales.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rob Smith in London",

    "event_name": "Mysterious Russia-linked buyers amass LNG ‘dark fleet’ ",
    "blurb": "Acquisition spree has driven up prices of older vessels as Moscow prepares for tighter trade restrictions  ",
    "date": "2024-07-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Mysterious buyers with suspected links to Russia have begun amassing dozens of vessels capable of carrying liquefied natural gas, in moves that suggest Moscow is expanding its “dark fleet” of energy tankers.\n\nShipping industry insiders say a clutch of previously unknown companies, largely registered in the United Arab Emirates, have rapidly acquired LNG vessels over the past year, driving up market prices, especially for the oldest ships.\n\nThe buying spree has echoes of how Moscow established a dark fleet of tankers to shuttle oil around the globe in the face of western sanctions, often using the UAE as a centre for energy trades. Although Russian LNG sales are less affected by western sanctions than oil, Moscow has been preparing for restrictions to tighten.\n\nSince the second quarter of 2023, more than 50 LNG vessels have changed ownership to companies located in the UAE, according to Windward, a risk consultancy for shipowners and governments. Prior to that, such transactions were rare.\n\nShip tracking group Kpler’s risk and compliance team said the developments in the LNG tanker market pointed “to a complex network of maritime operations potentially linked to Russian interests”.\n\nSome of the Dubai-based groups have opaque ownership structures that are similar to those operating Moscow’s dark fleet of oil tankers.\n\nSome of the newly acquired LNG vessels are now navigating routes traditionally used for transporting gas from Russia, according to Kpler. Its ship-tracking data showed one vessel loading LNG from Yamal, Russia’s flagship export project that has yet to be hit by sanctions.\n\nLNG has grown in importance for Russia’s wartime economy, providing valuable income after the loss of pipeline exports to Europe since its full- scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Both the EU and Asia, big markets for Russian LNG, have refrained from imposing a ban on imports to avoid disruption to the global gas market.\n\nBut the west has begun to take steps to restrict trade. In June, the EU approved restrictions that will forbid the unloading of Russian LNG from large icebreaking ships on to smaller vessels at EU ports, significantly limiting Russia’s options for distributing its gas globally.\n\nRussia’s big LNG project, Arctic LNG 2, has also been placed under sanctions by the US, making it increasingly difficult to ship cargoes out of the project.\n\nTraders say more opaque fleets could facilitate trading out of projects under sanctions, as well as boosting Russia’s operations in the market.\n\nThe increased buying has driven up the price of cheaper and less efficient LNG ships that are more than 15 years old, according to data from SSY, a shipbroker that facilitates vessel sales between owners. One LNG vessel built in 2007 sold for about $50mn in 2022, but this year, one was sold for $80mn.\n\n“The market for old steam turbine LNG ships had declined with increasing environmental regulations, as well as dramatic improvements in LNG propulsion technology,” said Toby Dunipace, managing director of LNG at SSY. “[But we have] seen a resurgence in the value of these types of vessels. Some of the explanation could be that they are going to the dark fleet.”\n\nThe developments have alarmed those in the industry already concerned by a rapid increase in the number of ageing vessels trading restricted oil, used by shipowners moving Russian cargoes outside of the western sanctions regime. Such ships are less likely to be insured against disasters but are much more vulnerable to accidents and spillages.\n\nDunipace said SSY’s LNG team always puts new customers through a sanctions check, but recent developments have put the risks “much more in focus” as Russia prepares for future restrictions on LNG exports. He added that the broker has already had to turn down a handful of potential customers this year, including one last week, due to failed sanctions checks.\n\nSergey Vakulenko, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it was a “no brainer” that Russia wanted to build up its LNG dark fleets, with pressure “increasing” on Russian LNG.\n\nWith the risk of market disruption set to be reduced in coming years as the US and Qatar produce more LNG, Russian projects such as Yamal LNG could come under sanctions, he said.\n\n“I think that the Russian LNG operators think that the writing is already on the wall and are preparing for it,” he said. “The trade-off is simple. If the sanctions do not happen, they have their own fleet and use it, and if the sanctions do happen, they are not stuck and can continue their trade.”",

    "blurb": "Gulf state is first nation to say it could put boots on the ground as part of postwar plan",
    "date": "2024-07-1800:00:00.0",
    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has signalled it is willing to send forces to a multinational “stabilisation” mission for Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war, becoming the first nation to say it could deploy boots on the ground in the strip.\n\nThe Gulf state said it could deploy its forces if the US provides a leadership role and supports steps towards a Palestinian state. The comments by Lana Nusseibeh, special envoy to the UAE foreign ministry, come as Arab states and the west struggle to devise a viable postwar plan for Gaza.\n\nNusseibeh told the Financial Times that Abu Dhabi had discussed the plans with the US as a step to fill the vacuum in besieged Gaza and address its massive humanitarian and reconstruction needs.\n\nShe said the UAE would only take part if invited by the Palestinian Authority, the western-backed body that administers limited parts of the occupied West Bank.\n\n“The UAE could consider being part of the stabilisation forces alongside Arab and international partners . . . at the invitation of a reformed PA, or a PA led by an empowered prime minister,” Nusseibeh said. “The United States should have the lead on this for it to succeed.”\n\nNusseibeh said Abu Dhabi had, “and continued to have, conversations on the ‘day after’ with all the concerned actors in the region”.\n\nThe Gulf state normalised relations with Israel in 2020 and has maintained communication with the Jewish state since Hamas’s October 7 attack triggered the war and Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza.\n\nDetails of the mission, including whether it was a military or police force, were still being discussed.\n\nThe US has been encouraging Arab states to take part in a multinational force for Gaza as part of its postwar planning, but it is not expected to deploy American troops.\n\nDiplomats have previously said that Egypt, which shares a border with Gaza, and Morocco, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020, were also considering the plan.\n\nIn May, the Arab League called for a UN peacekeeping force to be deployed in Gaza and the West Bank until a Palestinian state was established.\n\nBut the notion has been met with scepticism as the deployment of any force would face massive hurdles and depend on Israel’s actions.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected any moves towards a Palestinian state. He refuses to countenance any role for the PA in Gaza and insists Israel will retain overall security control there.\n\nHe has also rejected Hamas’s demands that Israel withdraw its troops from Gaza at talks mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt to halt the conflict and secure the release of Israeli hostages.\n\nOther Arab officials have expressed concerns about being seen as entering Gaza on the back of Israeli tanks, and the risks of being drawn into fighting an insurgency there.\n\nHowever, Nusseibeh said the alternative to the stabilisation mission was “to do more of the same, and that will only lead to more violence, radicalism and suffering for both Palestinians and Israelis”.\n\nThe UAE is considered to have one of the best trained Arab armies, and its forces have participated in at least six US-led coalitions since the 1990s, including in Afghanistan, Bosnia-Kosovo, Somalia and the fight against Isis. It also deployed troops in Yemen’s civil war as part of a Saudi-led coalition fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.\n\nIt is one of the few states to have a presence on the ground in Gaza as it operates a field hospital in the strip and delivers aid.\n\n“The plan [for Gaza] has to be what we believe is needed: a humanitarian component to help the Palestinian people in Gaza recover from the terrible destruction; [and] a security component,” Nusseibeh said. “And a political component that can facilitate a sustainable resolution of the conflict.”\n\nArab states have insisted that to ensure a sustainable resolution to the crisis, the US must pressure Israel to take irreversible measures towards a two-state solution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nBut they have also been frustrated by the lack of reform of the weak PA — led by octogenarian president Mahmoud Abbas for almost two decades — since October 7.\n\n“For us, what it would take [to participate in the mission] is US leadership, a reformed PA leadership and a road map towards reuniting Gaza and the West Bank under a single Palestinian government,” Nusseibeh said. “We [also] would need to see a clear articulation, a signal or a commitment to Palestinian statehood through negotiations.”",

    "body": "The writer is assistant minister for political affairs and special envoy of the UAE minister of foreign affairs\n\nTwo weeks ago, the United Arab Emirates evacuated a group of severely injured children and cancer patients from the Gaza Strip to Abu Dhabi. This was the 18th mission we have undertaken to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza over the past nine months. We have delivered almost 39,000 tonnes of urgent supplies, established six desalination plants, provided a floating hospital to treat the wounded and deployed a field hospital. Together with our partners, the UAE has been at the front line of responding to the suffering in Gaza.\n\nWith almost 40,000 killed and close to 90,000 injured, according to Palestinian officials, it is clear that a ceasefire and the release of all hostages and prisoners is vital — which we advocated for relentlessly during our recently concluded term on the UN Security Council. We extend our full support for the mediation efforts undertaken by Egypt, Qatar and the US.\n\nAs the international community considers how to approach the post-conflict period in Gaza, the UAE has been clear that the goal cannot be a return to the status quo before October 7. Any “day after” effort must fundamentally alter the trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict towards the establishment of a Palestinian state that lives in peace and security with the state of Israel. Our collective response to the horrors of war and occupation must lead to a sustainable and just peace.\n\nThat is why we must together pursue a strategy that breaks the cycle of violence in Gaza and lays the foundation for a different future for Israel and Palestine. A first step in such an effort is to deploy a temporary international mission that responds to the humanitarian crisis, establishes law and order, lays the groundwork for governance and paves the way to reuniting Gaza and the occupied West Bank under a single, legitimate Palestinian Authority.\n\nA temporary international mission focused on these four priorities can be a central part of a broader strategy to help the Palestinian people achieve their legitimate national aspiration of statehood through meaningful negotiations.\n\nA temporary international presence in Gaza can only result from a formal invitation from the Palestinian Authority. This must come from a government that is led by an empowered, credible and independent new prime minister, ready to tackle the reforms that are necessary to improve governance for all Palestinians and capable of taking on the responsibility of rebuilding Gaza.\n\nIsrael, as the occupying power, must also do its part for such an effort to succeed. Gaza cannot recover if it continues to live under a blockade. Neither can it be rebuilt if the legitimate Palestinian Authority is not allowed to take on its responsibilities. No effort will succeed if settlement construction, violence and incitement to violence continue to rise in the occupied West Bank.\n\nSuch a mission will need the full and steadfast backing of all relevant stakeholders that are committed to peace. With different capabilities and resources at our disposal, each of us can play a critical role in this process. The countries in the region can and must contribute significantly, for peace between Palestinians and Israelis is first and foremost in our own interest.\n\nAlongside regional actors, the leadership of the US, both in Gaza’s recovery and in efforts to revive the prospect of peace, remains indispensable. A reinforced and explicit American commitment to achieving the two-state solution, encouragement of Palestinian reforms and Israeli partnership as well as support for the international mission we suggest here are critical factors for success.\n\nIf post-conflict stabilisation and recovery are to follow from a ceasefire, there must also be rigorous monitoring and a system to enforce the ceasefire’s terms.\n\nFinally, to operationalise an effective humanitarian response plan that begins Gaza’s recovery, a temporary international mission cannot, and should not, seek to replace the UN or the work of its agencies on the ground. Rather, it must work in partnership with the UN system and amplify its resources and mandate.\n\nWe are under no illusions. We know that advancing such an effort will be extremely difficult. However, from our long experience of this conflict, we are confident that most Israelis and Palestinians yearn for peace. We believe that this stabilisation and recovery mission is a path out of the conflict and towards realising that yearning.",

    "body": "Seabirds screeching overhead and sun bouncing off his pristine white kandura, Ali Sajwani surveys his dominion from behind mirrored sunglasses. The property scion and billionaire’s son, 33, has paid over Drh500mn — more than $130mn — for this pair of empty islands lying off the coast of Dubai. The land is younger than he is.\n\nCreated by state-run developer Nakheel when Sajwani was around 12, this peculiar neighbourhood is known as the World Islands. Hover above it and the artificial archipelago would resemble a blotchy world map — one that is largely uninhabited. Dreamt and dredged up during Dubai’s first property boom in the mid-2000s, the World Islands fell victim to the crash following the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nBut now, with luxury property values in Dubai skyrocketing, Sajwani and others are betting that the World Islands can be resuscitated.\n\nLast year, 431 homes priced at $10mn or more were sold in Dubai, collectively worth $7.6bn. That was more than any other city in the world, according to property consultancy Knight Frank.\n\nThe trend has brought fresh allegations of Dubai’s open economy and property market being used to wash the proceeds of international criminality — a charge that Emirati economists say is unfair, and downplays the role of traditional laundromats such as London and Switzerland.\n\nWhy does Sajwani think Dubai has become a magnet for the mega rich? The self-described adrenaline junkie, whose father Hussain founded Dubai-based developer Damac Properties, cites factors such as security, governance and investor friendliness (plus, there is no personal income tax).\n\n“Also it helps in a big way [that] the rest of the world is sort of falling apart,” Sajwani said. “We don’t think Europe is going to come out of this . . . If you look at all the people moving here, they’re the wealthiest people from Europe.”\n\n“People don’t feel safe any more,” he continued, citing concerns about wearing an expensive watch in cities from London to Geneva.\n\nAzure water laps the shore as Sajwani gazes out to a palm-fronded enclave where Dubai’s royal family has a palace. Conservationists worry about the artificial islands’ impact on marine life, but he says local authorities are enforcing tough environmental standards.\n\nDubai’s property prices have soared, partly thanks to the war in Ukraine, which propelled many Russians here, but also because of the pandemic. Able to reopen faster than many other cities, the Middle East’s trade and tourist hub attracted new visitors, including “very wealthy people who summer in the south of France and winter in the Swiss Alps, and Dubai was never on their radar”, according to Sajwani.\n\nThe businessman, who is also building a resort in the Maldives, is not the first to try to make the concept work. The World Island called Lebanon was the first to offer a beach bar and sun loungers. The upmarket Anantara resort opened on Argentina in late 2021. While curious holidaymakers do visit, some projects are a little threadbare. Take the Heart of Europe islands, the brainchild of Austrian developer Josef Kleindienst, still spiked with cranes despite construction starting a decade ago.\n\nSajwani decided to buy the São Paulo and Uruguay World Islands as the property market heated up in late 2022 and early 2023. He then hired and fired two architects before finding one who designed 24 villas for the island, each with a dock. Residents are likely to spend winters here, Sajwani said. They will have to commute by boat. Meanwhile, the island has no infrastructure at all — some solar panels will be installed but diesel generators will provide most of the electricity.\n\nThat hasn’t put off buyers. All 24 villas — priced between Drh50mn ($14mn) and Drh125mn ($34mn) — are spoken for, according to Sajwani. The buyers include Europeans, Russians and Indians, he says.\n\nSajwani’s islands have been redubbed Amali — a portmanteau of Ali and his sister Amira’s names, the word also means “my hope” in Arabic.\n\n“The World Islands was this sort of forgotten, unloved child,” Sajwani said. Renaming them was about “prov[ing] everyone wrong”.\n\nchloe.cornish@ft.com",

    "date": "2024-07-1000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has sentenced more than 40 political and human rights activists to life in prison after convicting them on terrorism charges, in a trial that campaigners condemned as “shamelessly unfair”.\n\nThe state-run Emirates News Agency reported on Wednesday that the Abu Dhabi federal appeals court had convicted 53 defendants, including “leaders and members of the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood organisation”.\n\nOf those defendants, 43 were sentenced to life in jail, while a further 10 received prison terms of 10 to 15 years, the agency said.\n\nHuman rights groups said the accused were human rights activists, government critics and democracy advocates.\n\nThe Gulf state first brought the terrorism charges against dozens of people while it was hosting the UN COP28 climate conference last year.\n\nThere are more than 80 defendants in what human rights groups say is the UAE’s second-biggest mass trial ever, and many have been in jail for more than a decade, having originally been tried in 2013.\n\nAmong those sentenced to life imprisonment on Wednesday was human rights lawyer Mohammed al-Roken, according to the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Centre, an advocacy group.\n\nRoken was originally arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 10 years in jail in 2013, according to Amnesty International, after being charged with plotting rebellion. He was among the defendants who had served sentences but then faced fresh charges in last year’s trial.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi court ruled on Wednesday that the convicted people were involved with a group affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, an international Islamist organisation that the UAE says is a terrorist group.\n\nThe court also said the defendants were trying to incite violent protests. The state news agency did not cite specific incidents or other evidence.\n\nThe verdicts against the 53 defendants can be appealed. The court meanwhile dismissed cases against 24 defendants and acquitted one, the state news agency said.\n\nJoey Shea, UAE researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the harsh prison terms made a “mockery of justice”, adding: “The UAE has dragged scores of its most dedicated human rights defenders and civil society members through a shamelessly unfair trial riddled with due process violations and torture allegations.”\n\nMohamed al-Zaabi, director of the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Centre, described the trial as a “facade”.\n\nThe UAE does not tolerate dissent. It argues that a tough stance on security protects it from the political instability and violence that has affected many of its Middle East neighbours, helping the country cement its position as the region’s centre for business and tourism.\n\nBut human rights groups have insisted the mass trial damaged the UAE’s progressive image, and raised concerns about how justice was carried out.\n\nThey say the legal process has been shrouded in secrecy, that lawyers for the defendants have not had proper access to evidence, and that some prisoners have been held in solitary confinement.",

    "body": "Former BP chief executive Bernard Looney has met senior figures in the United Arab Emirates, as the Irishman seeks a comeback following a scandal last year over his past relationships with colleagues.Looney has held talks with Sultan al-Jaber, head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, and with Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE’s powerful national security adviser and businessman, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe talks have included a discussion about whether Looney could be involved in making private equity-style investments with the backing of the Gulf state, one of the people said. Looney has not discussed a role within Adnoc, that person added.\n\nAdnoc said in a statement to the Financial Times that the company had not held any talks with Looney but did not address whether any private discussions between him and Jaber had taken place. A representative for Looney declined to comment. Sheikh Tahnoon could not be reached for comment.\n\nLooney, who spent his entire career at the British oil major, resigned abruptly last September and was later dismissed for “serious misconduct” over his failure to fully disclose to the board past relationships with colleagues.\n\nThe 53-year-old was BP chief executive for less than four years. The company stripped him of as much as £32.4mn in pay and unvested share awards.\n\nIn his time at BP, Looney was respected in the industry for his ambitious attempt to pivot the 115-year-old oil company to cleaner fuels and retains friends in the sector.\n\nJaber was among industry executives and other business leaders who privately contacted Looney after his departure to offer support, according to people familiar with those conversations.\n\nBP and Adnoc have worked together in the UAE for more than 50 years, and while Looney was chief executive he and Jaber developed a close professional relationship.\n\nThe UAE was criticised by environmentalists for appointing the chief executive of its state oil company to head the COP28 climate talks last year. Looney was one of several high-profile leaders to come out in support of Jaber and even wrote a letter to the Financial Times in defence of him.\n\nJaber, who is also minister of industry and runs Masdar, the country’s biggest renewable energy company, is the UAE’s most powerful energy executive.\n\nBP first investigated allegations about Looney’s past relationships with colleagues in 2022, after which the then chief executive acknowledged some relationships and assured the board he had nothing further to disclose, the FT previously reported.\n\nWhen a second set of allegations last year revealed further relationships, Looney admitted that he had not been “fully transparent”. Those allegations included an accusation that he had promoted women with whom he had past undisclosed relationships, the FT reported.\n\nLooney has not spoken publicly since his resignation in September. In his only public statement on the matter he said in December that he was “disappointed with the way the situation has been handled”.",

The tool will be able to produce photo-real content for a wide range of applications.\n\nThe company has been awarded seven Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, including for Inception and Blade Runner 2049. The group, which has offices across the UK, India, the US and Canada, was created in 2014 following a merger between Double Negative and Prime Focus.\n\n“We’re trying to make a pivot from not just being a services company but also producing and owning our own content . . . [and] creating the next generation of technology tools that could be used by high end content creators,” said Namit Malhotra, DNEG chair and chief executive.\n\nDNEG is now working on films including Animal Friends alongside Legendary Entertainment, starring Ryan Reynolds, and The Angry Birds Movie 3. It is also producing an adaptation of Indian epic the Ramayana for global audiences.\n\nThe deal also shows the movie industry ambitions of Abu Dhabi, which also helped fund the £1.1bn acquisition this year of UK TV producer All3Media by RedBird IMI.\n\nDNEG will create a creative industries hub in Abu Dhabi following the deal, with plans to develop an industry in the Middle East for content production, storage and distribution.\n\n“Abu Dhabi is keen to invest in new initiatives and new technology, but also is looking to create a place where they are seen as not just financial investors, but people who are also developing and building their own industry,” Malhotra said.\n\nPrabhu Narasimhan, managing partner of NaMa Capital, which is one of the largest existing investors in DNEG, will join the DNEG Group’s board as well as chair its Brahma AI technology business.\n\nNarasimhan said the company would develop tools that would allow the creation of realistic CGI “using the power of AI to automate a lot of processes . . . to tell a story faster, better and cheaper”.\n\nAhmed Jasim Al Zaabi, chair of the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development, said the deal “accelerates technological advancements in the media and entertainment sectors but also underscores our commitment to fostering a robust ecosystem for content creation”.\n\n",

    "body": "Abu Dhabi’s state-backed green energy group Masdar is on the hunt for more European acquisitions after buying Greece’s biggest renewables company last week, as financial strains in the sector drive down valuations and create room for deals.\n\nMohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, chief executive, told the Financial Times the deal for Terna Energy at a €3.2bn valuation was just the start of a further expansion into central and eastern Europe.\n\n“The reality is we are not just acquiring this platform and portfolio,” he said. “We are going to be pumping more capital into Greece and into Europe.”\n\n“This is a strategic deal for us where we reinforce our presence in Greece but, more importantly, in eastern Europe,” he added, citing the company’s presence in Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, as well as its “strong pipeline” in the region.\n\nAfter a decade of rapid growth, the renewables industry has come under pressure from higher interest rates, particularly in Europe where several companies have scaled back or cancelled plans.\n\nBut Al Ramahi said higher interest rates had brought the sector back to reality and made people “come to their senses” over deals.\n\n“When interest rates were at zero, or negative, people were expecting high valuations. If you didn’t give them the value that they dreamt of, they could go to the bank and borrow at zero interest and continue their growth story. They don’t need you.\n\n“Now [higher rates] triggered a realisation to the market that the valuation they were thinking of is not real.”\n\nIn recent months, cash-rich buyers from the US and the Gulf states have stepped up their dealmaking in the capital-intensive sector.\n\nMasdar, which is funded by the UAE’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, its power and water company Taqa and its national oil company Adnoc, has amassed a $30bn portfolio of renewable projects.\n\nAs well as Terna, it recently bought 49 per cent of the UK’s £11bn Dogger Bank wind project, a €1.6bn slice of a wind farm in the Baltic Sea and a 50 per cent stake in US wind, solar and energy storage group Terra-Gen.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian infrastructure investor Brookfield and Singaporean state investment fund Temasek said last month they were in exclusive talks to buy French solar and wind developer Neoen at a €6.1bn valuation, after the company said it needed more capital for growth.\n\nConnor Teskey, head of renewable power at Brookfield, said at the time the talks were announced that he expected to see more deals.\n\n“In order to capture all this demand [for renewable electricity], these businesses need to be supported by very well-capitalised, deep-pocketed shareholders. That is in no way a criticism of the shareholders of the past that have built these great businesses and turned them into great platforms but there is simply a different scale that is required for this next chapter of growth.”\n\nOther big deals in the space include KKR’s €2.8bn takeover of Germany-headquartered renewable power producer Encavis, which is expected to close at the end of this year\n\nMasdar has turbocharged its dealmaking in order to meet its target of 100GW of renewable capacity by 2030. It currently has roughly 20GW of projects either up and running, being built or in development.\n\n“We needed to shift gear,” Al Ramahi said. “We needed to start looking at and assessing new opportunities that are large and at scale. We had to start thinking about making big acquisitions.”\n\nDespite growing concerns in many European governments over foreign ownership of critical energy infrastructure, Al Ramahi said Masdar had so far not run into any issues.\n\n“We have not seen that we are not welcomed anywhere,” he said. “On the contrary, all doors have been opened for us everywhere we have gone.”\n\nHe added that he was neutral on using Chinese-made solar panels or wind turbines. “We believe in an open liberal market. [We will buy from] anyone who can scale up and supply the product at the right time, at the right price.”\n\n",

Quant hedge fund Winton Capital Management has had an office in Abu Dhabi for the past five years. Brevan Howard now runs more money from Abu Dhabi than it does from either London or New York.\n\nMarshall Wace declined to comment.\n\nOther funds such as Izzy Englander’s Millennium, Steve Cohen’s Point72 and quant investing giant AQR have picked Dubai to establish a presence in the region. Both cities benefit from their geographical position, straddling the European and Asian trading days.\n\nHedge fund managers have been expanding their presence in the Middle East in an attempt to win local business and forge ties with sovereign wealth funds in the region. The lure of low taxes has also attracted them to Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The majority of them are London- or New York-based funds opening subsidiaries.\n\nThe pandemic helped Dubai and Abu Dhabi position themselves as attractive alternatives to London, New York and Hong Kong. Hedge fund managers said they experienced an increase in relocation inquiries during government-mandated lockdowns in Europe and the US, reflecting how Dubai’s Covid-19 restrictions were less harsh. In addition, Abu Dhabi has been trying to make itself a hub for blockchain technology.\n\nSince Paul Marshall and Ian Wace founded Marshall Wace in 1997, the hedge fund has carved out a position as Europe’s answer to US industry giants Citadel and Millennium.\n\nIts assets under management have mushroomed to a record $65bn, defying a trend that has seen many of the region’s equities hedge funds under pressure.\n\nFounder Marshall’s Eureka fund, which accounts for about a third of the firm’s assets, is up about 8 per cent this year, according to investors.\n\nThe remaining two-thirds of its assets are run in systematic strategies that use computer algorithms. About a third of its roughly 650 employees work in technology-related roles and the firm spends tens of millions of dollars a year on tech.\n\n",

    "body": "The United Arab Emirates is seeking a “marriage” with the US over artificial intelligence as the Gulf state hopes to use its oil wealth to become a global superpower in developing the cutting-edge technology.The UAE’s AI minister Omar Sultan Al Olama told the Financial Times that a recent deal with Microsoft to acquire a $1.5bn stake in Abu Dhabi’s commercial AI champion G42 was only the start of greater tech collaboration between the two countries.\n\nThat deal, which followed months of negotiations between US and UAE officials, led to G42’s promise that it would dump Chinese systems as the US seeks to maintain dominance over AI.\n\n“Now you’re going to see the outcomes of that marriage, if I may use that word, between both G42 and Microsoft, but also the UAE and the United States,” said Al Olama. “When you look at the frontier technology, at the most cutting edge, that needs to be in co-ordination with the US players and there needs to be reassurances that are given to the US.”\n\nFuelled by sovereign wealth funds worth about $2tn, the UAE’s AI ambitions have emerged into sharper focus this year as it tries to lower its economic dependence on fossil fuels in part by positioning itself as a global AI hub.\n\nAbu Dhabi has created the investment vehicle MGX, expected to be worth billions of dollars, chaired by the UAE’s powerful national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan. MGX has been in talks with San Francisco-based OpenAI over its chip development plans, the Financial Times has reported, and Sheikh Tahnoon has spearheaded discussions between the UAE and US on AI.\n\nThe UAE is building AI capabilities in key sectors from healthcare to defence and believes that AI can help its biggest enterprises become more efficient. Abu Dhabi’s national oil company said the use of AI-tools helped to generate $500mn in cost savings last year through increasing production capacity and making operations more streamlined.\n\nThe UAE is up against stiff global competition. The US and China are battling to take a technological lead over AI, while start-ups in the UK, France and across Asia are attracting multibillion-dollar investment from international investors.However, the UAE’s advantage is being able to provide unparalleled access to capital. Expectations that Abu Dhabi will invest heavily in AI projects overseas has also attracted industry leaders to the nation in recent months, from OpenAI’s Sam Altman to Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.\n\nThe UAE has stockpiled chips needed to power large language models, with Al Olama estimating the country had amassed a backlog that would serve its needs for two years. However, US officials are also seeking to slow the shipment of some AI chips to the Middle East, including the UAE, according to Bloomberg.\n\nSome observers worry about the autocratic UAE having access to advanced AI technology.\n\nMarietje Schaake, international policy fellow at Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, said US policy around AI had so far been pragmatic, narrowly focused on combating China.\n\n“The singular focus on China means other countries can claim to be part of a like-minded coalition, and the US administration gladly turns a blind eye to their human rights violations in the meantime,” said the former European parliament member.\n\nThis month, Abu Dhabi’s Advanced Technology Research Council released its latest large language model, Falcon 2, which it said has been assessed by outside evaluators as performing as well or better than rival LLMs made by Meta and Google.\n\nATRC has also spun out a commercial AI company, AI71, to build models based on UAE government data from health authorities and the judicial system.\n\nThe government data gives the UAE a “very strong critical advantage in this game, where there are very few players that have a lot of proprietary data”, said Faisal Al Bannai, ATRC’s secretary-general.\n\nAbu Dhabi also opened Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, the world’s first AI dedicated university, in 2019.\n\nThe institute has helped establish a pipeline for talent in the UAE, a major challenge for the country of only 10mn, most of whom are expats. Though a fifth of the university’s graduate students are from the UAE, 22.5 per cent are from China, said the university’s provost Tim Baldwin.\n\nWhile Abu Dhabi focuses on building AI technologies, its neighbouring emirate Dubai wants to apply them.\n\nDubai plans to increase its data centre capacities to host the cloud computing needed for AI and wants to foster AI “clusters” of companies around established industries such as finance.\n\n“There is a belief, across all of the leadership levels in the UAE, that AI is a technology that we are going to focus on,” said Al Olama. “The decisions we take today [ . . .] are going to shape how the UAE is for future generations.”",

    "blurb": "As China steps back, the oil-rich Gulf state has become an important source of foreign investment — but with fresh layers of complexity",
    "date": "2024-05-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "When Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, jetted several hundred friends into a private airport in the Eastern Cape province to celebrate Eid last year, it showed both the promise and pitfalls in dealing with a new cash-rich player in Africa.\n\nAhead of a stay at his private resort in one of South Africa’s poorest regions, the UAE ruler was reported to have donated R20mn ($1mn) to upgrade the runway at the backwater airport, which the authorities made an international port of entry for the occasion.\n\nBut despite the mutual display of goodwill, South Africa had failed to convince the UAE to turn over the Gupta brothers, accused by South African authorities of looting the state. The Guptas had fled to the Emirates in 2018 but around two weeks before Sheikh Mohammed was touring the Eastern Cape, a Dubai court refused to extradite two of the brothers citing incorrect paperwork, a ruling South Africa’s justice minister described as “shocking”.\n\nThe fact that South Africa nevertheless rolled out the red carpet for Sheikh Mohammed and his entourage is a sign of just how influential the UAE has become there and across the continent — and an illustration of the complexities this new alignment can sometimes bring.\n\nAs China pares back loans to Africa, the oil-rich Gulf state has become an increasingly important source of foreign investment. In 2022 and 2023, the UAE pledged $97bn in new African investments across renewable energy, ports, mining, real estate, communications, agriculture and manufacturing — three times more than China, according to fDi Markets, an FT-owned company tracking cross-border greenfield projects.\n\nA UAE official tells the FT that its total investments into Africa amount to $110bn, reflecting “the country’s commitment to facilitating sustainable development and growth across the continent.”\n\nThe UAE is now “going toe to toe with Beijing”, says Ken Opalo, an associate professor at Georgetown University in the US, of the nation’s presence in Africa. While many of these investments will not materialise, he says, the Emirates has consistently been a top-four investor on the continent over the past decade.\n\nCompanies from the UAE have embraced projects in Africa that more risk-averse investors have avoided. Africa has much “to offer in terms of commodities and minerals,” says Hamad Buamim, chair of Dubai’s main trading hub the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, despite the “challenges when it gets to policies and politics”.\n\nThis wall of money is allowing the UAE to help shape not only their countries’ economic destinies, but in some cases the political fortunes of some African leaders. When fighters from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front were threatening Addis Ababa during Ethiopia’s civil war in 2021, the UAE provided military drones to the government, according to a senior US official and Tigrayan leaders. The UAE official says it “supports the institutions and people of Ethiopia rather than any particular parties or individuals”.\n\nWhen Sudan’s generals deposed Omar al-Bashir in 2019, the UAE stepped in to bail out the new regime, later lending some support to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in the civil war that erupted last year, according to a UN panel of experts. The UAE strongly denies backing either side in the conflict and has publicly advocated for peace.\n\nMurithi Mutiga, Africa Programme Director at Crisis Group, a non-profit, says the UAE’s engagement in places like Sudan is partly motivated by its desire to counter Islamist extremism. But, he says, it has also seized the chance to diversify its economy with investments in food security, critical minerals and renewable energy.\n\nAll of that makes its impact ambivalent, Mutiga says. “China is a status quo power, Russia is a revisionist power and the UAE veers between the two,” he adds, referencing two of the other major foreign players in Africa.\n\nWestern officials say the growing influence of the UAE and other Gulf countries in Africa adds a new layer of complexity. “This is the new world we’re in, where you have middle powers and global powers operating on the continent,” says one former official in the Biden administration, who did not want to be named.\n\nWhile the influence of Abu Dhabi — the UAE’s oil-rich capital and foreign policy setter — has risen in recent years, Dubai, the region’s financial and trading hub, has long been an important financial centre. African companies are choosing to base themselves there to trade with the rest of the world, says Buamim. “This is where Dubai really played its cards quite well: to be the gateway to Africa.”\n\nThe number of African companies registered in Dubai has increased dramatically in the past decade, reaching 26,420 by 2022, according to the Dubai Chamber of Commerce. “Dubai is New York for Africans now,” says Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, a professor of international politics at Oxford university who has studied Africa-UAE links.\n\nThe UAE official says that its engagement in Africa, from trade to food security and counterterrorism, was in pursuit of “fostering a prosperous future based on mutual benefit”. But some see the UAE’s inroads into Africa as part of a larger vision to wield more power on the world stage.\n\nSaad Ali Shire, finance minister of Somaliland, the breakaway republic in which Dubai-based logistics business DP World has invested heavily, has no doubts about the Emirates’ growing clout. “The UAE is a new superpower in Africa,” he says.\n\nEmirati engagement with Africa fits into three broad, if overlapping, categories. The first is purely commercial, the second strategic and the third is a financial role, traditionally played by global centres such as London or Zurich, in which Dubai has become an attractive jurisdiction for Africans to trade, do business and park offshore money.\n\n“What’s driving this for the UAE, and of course for other Gulf countries as well, is the energy transition and the hard push for economic diversification,” says Anna Jacobs, Crisis Group’s senior Gulf analyst. “Africa really is this huge untapped market [with] minerals and agriculture.”\n\nCommercially, clean energy is one area of interest. Over the past decade, Masdar, Abu Dhabi’s renewable energy investor, has built infrastructure including five wind farms in South Africa, a battery energy storage system in Senegal and solar power facilities in Mauritania. Masdar is leading UAE plans to invest $10bn to increase sub-Saharan Africa’s electricity-generation capacity by 10GW.\n\nBut UAE companies are also investing in fossil fuels. In May, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company bought a 10 per cent stake in Mozambique’s Rovuma gas basin, acquiring it from Portuguese energy company Galp for around $650mn.\n\nIn real estate, Dubai Investments, a listed conglomerate whose biggest shareholder is Dubai’s sovereign wealth fund, this year announced it would start work on a 2,000-hectare property development in Angola. The Abu Dhabi-based telecoms company formerly know as Etisalat, now e&, operates in 12 countries across Africa.\n\nUAE companies have begun to make a splash in mining too. International Resources Holding, a unit of International Holding Company, the $240bn Abu Dhabi conglomerate chaired by UAE national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, last year paid $1.1bn for a majority stake in Mopani, a Zambian copper mine previously owned by Glencore. IHR has also expressed interest in investing in mines in Angola, Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nLast year, Primera, an Abu Dhabi-based gold trader, was granted a 25-year monopoly by the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo for all small-scale “artisanal” gold supplies in the country. Much African gold, both legal and smuggled, passes through Dubai, according to experts and African government officials.\n\nPeter Pham, a former US special envoy to the Great Lakes region for President Donald Trump, describes UAE African mining ambitions as “relatively benign” and in line with Washington’s interests. “They dilute the Chinese and they provide an alternative supply chain,” he says. “If they can pull it off, I’m all for it.”\n\nNot all UAE investments are free of controversy. In Tanzania, authorities have been accused by human rights groups of violently forcing thousands of Maasai off their land to make way for a safari and hunting project linked to a UAE company. Blue Carbon, a Dubai-based private investment vehicle, has been accused by activists of seeking to grab millions of hectares of African forests in what they deem a greenwashing exercise after signing preliminary agreements in Liberia, Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe aimed at generating carbon credits.\n\nStill, many countries welcome the Emirates’ interest. “The UAE is a very good partner to Kenya and many other countries,” William Ruto, Kenya’s president, tells the FT.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference UAE money has made is in logistics where Emirates’ commercial and strategic ambitions overlap.\n\nDP World is present in nearly a dozen African countries after pouring some $3bn into the continent. It now operates ports from Mozambique on the Indian Ocean in the south to Algeria on the Mediterranean in the north and Angola on the Atlantic, virtually encircling the continent.\n\n“Our entry into these markets is not driven by political agenda. It’s driven by a business agenda that may derive other benefits,” said Mohammed Akoojee, DP World’s chief executive for sub-Saharan Africa. He acknowledges an overarching strategy of connecting Dubai to the continent via trade. “There’s definitely that vision from the Emirates,” he says. “The government of Dubai uses companies like DP World and Emirates [the airline] to build a global presence.”\n\nAD Ports, an Abu Dhabi logistics company majority-owned by sovereign investor ADQ, operates fewer ports in Africa than DP World, but there are signs it wants to catch up. Last year, it won a 30-year concession to run Pointe Noire port in the Republic of Congo and in April it secured a 20-year concession to manage Angola’s Luanda terminal, initially committing $250mn to its modernisation.\n\n“If the government is investing in its trading partners . . . then naturally you need the private sector to come in and invest,” says Ross Thompson, AD Ports group chief strategy and growth officer.\n\nThe place where the UAE’s port investments are most obviously strategic is Berbera, the main port of the breakaway republic of Somaliland, located on the Gulf of Aden, where UAE flags can be seen fluttering in the desert landscape. DP World has invested $300mn in the port and an adjacent free-trade zone, while the UAE has been refurbishing the coastal city’s airport. Somaliland has also granted the Emirates a 25-year concession for a naval base.\n\nThe political ramifications go further. DP World took over Berbera port in 2017 shortly after the company was ejected from Djibouti, which accused it of “colonialism”, allegations denied by DP World. Since its move 250km south to Berbera, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development has spent almost $90mn building a smart new paved road linking Berbera with the capital Hargeisa and, crucially, on to the Ethiopian border.\n\nThis year, in a move that enraged Somalia, which rejects Somaliland’s claim to independence, Addis Ababa signed an agreement with Hargeisa. In return for recognising Somaliland as a legitimate state, landlocked Ethiopia would gain access to a stretch of coastline on the Red Sea where it could develop a port and naval base.\n\nMany see the hand of the UAE behind the bold play. “When it comes to the UAE government, they are seeking to have political influence in the region,” says one senior Somali official.\n\nThe UAE’s most controversial alleged actions in Africa have taken place in war zones. In 2019 and 2020, it actively supported General Khalifa Haftar, a Libyan warlord, after he launched an attack on Tripoli to oust the UN-backed government. The UAE has denied breaking an arms embargo on Libya.\n\nEven more controversial is the UAE’s alleged fuelling of the Sudanese civil war by helping to arm General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti, an accusation the UAE has repeatedly denied. A former camel trader with previous links to the Emirates, Hemeti now runs the RSF paramilitary force fighting for control of the country. The RSF has been accused by Human Rights Watch of committing ethnic cleansing in Darfur.\n\nDespite the UAE’s denials, an independent panel of experts for the UN says there is some evidence it was supplying arms in the guise of humanitarian aid through Chad. “The UAE is not playing by any rule book in Africa,” says Cameron Hudson, a Sudan expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “They’re chaos agents in Sudan.”\n\nAlbadr SS Alshateri, professor at the National Defence College in Abu Dhabi, says he has no knowledge of the UAE’s alleged backing of Hemeti. But the UAE does suspect that the Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, may be closely linked to Islamists. As a general rule, “the UAE sees itself as pursuing stabilisation,” Alshateri says.\n\nThe third role that the UAE is playing in Africa is that of freewheeling financial hub.\n\nOxford’s Soares de Oliveira says western legal firms, investment banks and wealth managers all offer services in Dubai — including arbitration over disputes — that companies from Africa and elsewhere have traditionally sought in London and Geneva.\n\n“Dubai is the ideal ecosystem: it offers the same blue-chip world-class services that are essentially Anglo or Swiss, but it is lawless enough to be a free for all,” he says.\n\nDubai is still considered a more flexible jurisdiction despite being removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) “grey list” this February after two years on the naughty step, he says, although centres like London are still conduits for suspicious transactions.\n\nMany of the 26,000-plus African companies registered in Dubai are “letterbox companies”, says Soares de Oliveira. “That allows Africans to keep dollars away from African economies. You pay suppliers in Dubai and the money never comes back.”\n\nWealthy Africans, including politically exposed persons, also find a safe harbour in Dubai where they can buy property and enjoy a world-class lifestyle. Other high-profile residents include Isabel dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of Angola’s former president, who moved to the city in 2020 days after the new Angolan government froze her assets.\n\nThe expanding presence of the UAE and other Gulf countries in Africa and vice versa presents a quandary for Washington.\n\nThe US does not approve of everything the UAE is doing there, says the former Biden administration official, but it regards it as a vital global ally, including in the Middle East. “It’s such a challenging actor,” he adds. “In Africa, they’re both investing in positive ways and acting in destabilising ways at the same time.”\n\nHudson at the Center for Strategic and International Studies is more sceptical. “It may be OK in the near term,” he says. “You let me do what I want in Sudan and I’ll give you what you need in Gaza. That’s a very transactional relationship, but it’s not a friendship.”\n\nAlshateri at Abu Dhabi’s National Defence College says the UAE’s rise is tied to Washington’s declining influence in Africa: “They had to pick up the slack because the US is backsliding on its security commitment.”",

    "blurb": "Illicit trade now accounts for about 40% of continent’s production, according to Swissaid ",
    "date": "2024-05-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UAE has been accused of being a leading recipient of tens of billions of dollars worth of gold smuggled out of Africa every year, reflecting growing concern over the illicit trade in the region’s precious metals.\n\nIn a comprehensive study, Swissaid estimated that about 435 tonnes of gold worth about $31bn were exported undeclared out of Africa in 2022 — a doubling of illicit volumes in a decade to about 40 per cent of the continent’s production, or 12 per cent of global mined supply.\n\nThe UAE, whose dominant regional trading hub Dubai is known for its gold market, accounted for 93 per cent of undeclared African exports, the NGO’s report said. The next two biggest importers were Switzerland and India.\n\nAfter gold prices hit record highs earlier this year, the figures will intensify scrutiny of illegal mining in conflict zones such as the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan as well as the role of the UAE’s precious metals industry.\n\nMarc Ummel, one of the report’s authors, said the Financial Action Task Force, the international body that tackles money laundering, should reconsider the removal in February of the UAE from its “grey list” of countries.\n\n“You should not be removed from the list when you have 400 tonnes that come to your country illegally,” he said. “This is a big quantity of money leaving Africa connected to money laundering, conflict and human rights issues that does not benefit the people who extract the gold and are trying to support their families.”\n\nEmirates Gold, one of the nation’s largest refineries, was suspended last year from accessing Dubai and London’s gold markets, which require anti-money laundering and responsible sourcing standards. The refiner said at the time that the suspension had nothing to do with its compliance processes and it has always abided by responsible sourcing and anti-money laundering practices.\n\nA UAE official acknowledged there have been “concerns around gold smuggling into Dubai”, but said the country had “implemented detailed new regulations for gold and precious metals to mitigate these risks effectively”.\n\nThe extraction of gold by “artisanal” miners has been a long-standing issue for the gold sector but has become more acute after a surge in prices for the metal. Gold hit a record $2,400 per troy ounce in April as emerging market central banks led by China snapped up bullion to diversify their reserves away from the US dollar.\n\nAmong African nations, Mali, Zimbabwe and Ivory Coast had the largest volumes of undeclared gold production, the report said.\n\nThe UAE introduced new regulations on gold refineries in 2023 to improve due diligence when sourcing gold, including screening and conducting site visits of artisanal mines. But the Gulf state has disputed whether its approach to accepting artisanal and small-scale mining is harmful to the individuals digging and panning on the ground.\n\nLast year Primera, an Abu Dhabi-based gold trader, was granted a 25-year monopoly by the Democratic Republic of Congo for the trade and export of small-scale “artisanal” gold supplies, in a move aimed at combating the smuggling trade. The central African country is fighting rebels in its eastern border regions, where a mining belt holds vast amounts of gold.\n\nArmed groups including the M23 militia control supply chains into Rwanda and Uganda, analysts and Congolese officials say. The US Treasury has said most DRC gold was smuggled into neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda, where it was refined and exported mainly to the UAE.\n\nKigali has repeatedly denied Rwanda benefits from what Congo claims is the $1bn a year it loses from the unauthorised export of minerals, adding that its mining sector is “fully regulated and monitored” and “traceability is compulsory”.\n\n“The Congolese are saying that we steal . . . their gold,” Rwandan President Paul Kagame said in November 2022. Most of what “goes through here does not stay here”, he added. “It goes to Dubai, to Brussels, to Tel Aviv . . . and they accuse us of stealing Congolese minerals — how about the destination?”\n\nThe UAE was the main destination for the vast majority of artisanal gold extracted in the 18 African countries on the EU’s list of conflict-affected and high-risk nations, the report added.\n\nHowever, the UAE official added that the country required all gold refineries “to comply with due diligence regulations for responsible sourcing of gold, which is aligned to the OECD due diligence guidance for responsible supply chain of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas”.\n\nEarlier this year, the US sanctioned Al-Fakher Advanced Works, a holding company that the Treasury department said exports gold for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that have been fighting the Sudanese army in a brutal civil war.",

    "event_name": "Russia sanctions are ineffective, says Dubai trade hub chief",
    "blurb": "Measures imposed on Moscow do not halt business but simply redirect it, DMCC chair says ",
    "date": "2024-05-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sanctions on Russia are having no impact outside the west and attempts to halt the flow of business merely redirect it elsewhere, the chair of Dubai’s main trading hub has said.\n\n“Sanctions slow the economy, never stop it,” said Hamad Buamim, chair of the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, a leading United Arab Emirates free trade zone that says it hosts more than 24,000 businesses. He is also the former president of Dubai’s chamber of commerce. “Trade continues flowing, it just flows in a different way,” he told the Financial Times in an interview.\n\nBuamim’s comments come as Dubai leverages its geographical position between east and west to cement itself as a node for world commerce at a time when sanctions imposed on Russia over the war in Ukraine, economic protectionism and US-China tensions are reshaping global trade.\n\nDubai is seen as a beneficiary of US and European attempts to isolate Russia’s economy, as oil traders relocated from Geneva to the UAE after Switzerland joined the sanctions imposed on Moscow. Energy is the most important sector for the DMCC, according to Buamim, with some 3,000 energy companies registered in the zone.\n\nHowever, in recent months the UAE, along with other countries, has been under pressure from the US, EU and UK to act against companies trading with Russia.\n\n“The fact that the economy is not purely controlled by one side of the world makes these sanctions less effective,” Buamim said. “If we just take the Ukraine conflict, [sanctions] are effective when you look west, but they are not really effective beyond that.”\n\nHe added: “We don’t see them as a great tool to make any impact. They are just making trade more complex and impacting the whole world.”\n\nThe US has in particular targeted international banks that finance trade deals. The UK has also imposed sanctions on the Dubai-based oil trader Paramount Energy & Commodities DMCC, an entity set up two years before G7 members imposed a price cap on Russian oil. The group is a subsidiary of Paramount Energy & Commodities SA, a Swiss group founded by veteran Dutch trader Niels Troost, which is also subject to UK sanctions.\n\nThe European parliament, meanwhile, has voted against removing the UAE from the EU’s “grey list” of high-risk countries, alleging it had made lacklustre efforts to address Russian sanctions evasion. The issue is now with the European Commission.\n\nThe restrictions have made it difficult for Russia to produce advanced weapons and sustain the rate of fire it maintained earlier in the war, according to defence analysts.\n\nThe CREA, a Finnish energy think-tank, said sanctions on Russian oil exports cost the Kremlin about €34bn in 2023, with almost all the cost coming from driving down the price of Russian oil.\n\nThis month, Gazprom also reported a $7bn loss after Russian gas exports halved in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia has also faced significant price rises on types of imports targeted by sanctions and export controls.\n\nBut Buamim said the sanctions were not the reason companies had relocated to Dubai. “It is not the Russians that really dominated the growth. We had growth coming from Switzerland. We have companies from other countries. They see that Dubai has the infrastructure, the market access and the neutral stance [on the war].”\n\nMany international companies that had to leave Russia also needed to find a location where their Russian staff would be welcome, he added.\n\nBuamim was speaking as the DMCC released a report on the future of trade that predicted increasing challenges from deglobalisation and climate change, balanced in part by the use of artificial intelligence to redraw and manage logistics.\n\n“Protectionism has started to top the agenda of all politicians. Unfortunately, politics is driving decisions that are not commercially viable for the global economy,” he said.\n\nUntil now, he said, the UAE and the Gulf states in general had managed to maintain a neutral position that was, for example, “neither pro-American or anti-China”. But this was becoming more difficult to maintain as the US started to ask countries to choose sides, he said.\n\n“That tension between the US and China is no longer a US-China problem,” Buamim said. “This is a challenge for businesses throughout the world.”\n\nThis story has been corrected to say that Hamad Buamim is the former president of Dubai’s chamber of commerce, not its current president, and also to state that the DMCC-based subsidiary of Paramount Energy & Commodities SA was set up two years before G7 members imposed a price cap on Russian oil.",

    "blurb": "Business owned by IHC broke into market last year with acquisition of a major Zambian copper mine",
    "date": "2024-05-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The mining business owned by $240bn Abu Dhabi conglomerate IHC has embarked on a flurry of deals in Africa, after breaking into the market last year with its acquisition of a major Zambian copper mine.\n\nIHC chief executive Syed Basar Shueb told the Financial Times that its IRH subsidiary had signed joint venture agreements for iron ore mining in two places in Angola — Kassala Kitungo and Munenga — and that it was in advanced talks to mine nickel in Burundi as well as various metals in Tanzania and Kenya.\n\nIHC expected to make about $1bn of mining acquisitions this year, Shueb told the Financial Times.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi group’s foray into the mining industry comes as BHP’s £34bn approach for rival Anglo American highlights the race to secure access to minerals such as copper, iron ore and lithium that are critical to the transition to cleaner energy.\n\nAsked who IRH was bidding against for mining assets, Shueb said the “majority of the time you’re competing with Chinese. There’s no other countries.”\n\nIHC is chaired by Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is also the United Arab Emirates’ national security adviser and a key business figure.\n\nIRH appeared to have come from nowhere when it launched a $1.1bn bid for 51 per cent of the Mopani copper mine in Zambia last year. But Shueb said the group had been formed from different mining interests belonging to IHC and Royal Group, an investment group also chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon that preceded IHC.\n\n“Whether it’s a mining or a refinery business of the gold, or the trading side of the business, we have consolidated everything under IRH,” Shueb said.\n\nHe said IRH’s strategy was to buy mining concessions, as opposed to providing investment to other operators in return for future supply of raw materials, and that it wanted to make its mining projects “green” by using renewable energy sources, such as solar power.\n\nIRH did previously have some involvement in a gold trading scheme in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The company said it had facilitated an arrangement between Auric Hub Gold Refinery, an Abu Dhabi gold and silver refinery, and gold trading business Primera Gold DRC, which last year won a 25-year monopoly for hand-dug gold in the DRC.\n\nHowever, Shueb said this trading operation was now being handed over to the DRC government.\n\nHe also said IRH was discussing taking over Konkola Copper Mines with the Zambian government. Vedanta, the Indian metals and energy group, operates the mine and wants to sell a minority stake.\n\n“Next to Mopani is KCM . . . we are talking to the government because it makes a lot of sense that one party manages Mopani and KCM,” he said.\n\n“We had a few meetings with Vedanta and the government, but of course, Vedanta is a large player, they are much more experienced than us.”\n\nIRH employed about 60 mining specialists, Shueb said, and was owned by an IHC holding group called TwoPointZero that had other technology, financial sector, and metals assets.",

    "blurb": "Deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden flew out to Gulf state as Britain seeks fresh investment   ",
    "date": "2024-05-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden made a secret trip to the United Arab Emirates last week in an attempt to repair a diplomatic relationship that has fallen into its worst state in years.\n\nHis visit, made before travelling to Saudi Arabia on an official delegation, followed increasing frustration from Emirati officials over comments by British politicians about a blocked UAE-linked bid to buy the Telegraph.\n\nThe relationship has also been further damaged by a perceived recent United Nations snub.\n\nThe tensions have come as the UK seeks billions of pounds of fresh investment from the state’s deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds.\n\nAbu Dhabi has been taken aback that UK domestic politics appears to have trumped what the UAE considers an important strategic relationship, officials and analysts from both countries said.\n\nSome Emirati officials feel the country has been demoted to a “punching bag” for British politicians seeking to appear tough domestically, said one person close to talks between the two nations.\n\n“This isn’t anger or frustration,” said a second person with knowledge of the bilateral relationship. “This is exhaustion.”\n\nSenior British politicians have recognised that the UK hostility to the Telegraph deal has frayed the ties between the two nations.\n\nKemi Badenoch, UK business and trade secretary, told the Financial Times that politicians “are often careless about how they speak about other countries . . . There was probably a lot said about the UAE that was very undiplomatic . . . There are lessons to be learned about how we do that better.”\n\nThe pair have close historic links, including a 2021 deal for the UAE to invest £10bn in new technologies and energy in the UK.\n\nBut officials and analysts from both sides said a series of recent ruptures have left ties in their worst state since 2018, when the UAE briefly jailed a British academic on spying charges that the UK strongly denied.\n\nDowden’s visit, where he met with senior Emirati government officials, was the latest salvo in a concerted effort to repair the relationship. The UK’s Cabinet Office said Dowden discussed “deepening and strengthening our diplomatic and investment ties”.\n\nWeeks earlier, UK foreign secretary Lord David Cameron met his counterpart, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum meetings in Riyadh.\n\nThe relationship has been eroded over several years. In 2022, Iran-backed Houthis launched missile and drone attack close to the capital, Abu Dhabi. Emirati officials were dismayed when then-prime minister Boris Johnson failed to call or issue any public statement of support shortly after the event.\n\nThis year, the UK’s ruling Conservative government raised questions over the autocratic state’s media record, and effectively blocked an Abu Dhabi-backed £600mn takeover of the Telegraph Media Group. The failed bid had been backed by vice-president Sheikh Mansour, whose brother is the Gulf state’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. The UAE government was not directly involved in the deal.\n\nOne UK government figure said there was “nervousness” inside Whitehall that blocking the Telegraph deal could further delay a long-awaited trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes the UAE as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\n\nMore recently, the UK called a meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the ongoing bloody war in Sudan, in which more than 15,000 people have been killed.\n\nAt the meeting, to which the UAE was not invited, a representative of the Sudanese Armed Forces accused the UAE of backing its opponent, the Rapid Support Forces.\n\nEmirati officials strongly deny the claims of involvement, and foreign secretary Sheikh Abdullah spoke directly to Cameron about the incident, according to people briefed on their discussions.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office said: “The UK enjoys a strong relationship with the UAE and is committed to working closely on a range of issues.” The UAE ministry of foreign affairs did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRising concern about the UK’s conduct comes as the UAE’s own global star rises as an increasingly influential Arab power.\n\n“The UK was in the top five, maybe even top three of the UAE’s allies and partners since the UAE’s establishment,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political science professor and senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\n“Things have changed over the past 50 years, the UAE is a rising regional power . . . and the UK is apparently stuck in the past, does not realise there is a new UAE,” he added.\n\nThe pair are still working on Gaza, energy and climate issues, and the relationship has come through rocky patches before.\n\nBut some analysts said this time the UK needed to show contrition.\n\n“The UK has to understand that when the UAE is angry, you have to take the UAE seriously,” said Abdulla. “Maybe it’s time the UK pays us a visit and says sorry.”",

    "blurb": "From someone who relies on it for ideas, this is how to find it",
    "date": "2024-05-1100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The nearest thing to stress in this job is having to come up with ideas each week. Some arise from private thought. Some, though fewer than most imagine, come from reading. But much the richest source is conversation. And so the most important “work” I do is the cultivation of interesting people. I know the secrets of how and where to find high-grade talk. Readers might care to know a few.\n\nThe distracted host gets up once more to check on the fricassée. The guests, several of whom have just met, pause at intervals to overpraise the cooking. On top of all this, as we are in someone’s home, pressing a point too hard in conversation is just awkward. The result? Fragmented chit-chat. No chance of developing an argument. The language of dinner parties is a blur of second-hand aperçus (“This is the end of the end of history”) that we might call podcast-ese.\n\nTake it out of the domestic space. The philosopher Jürgen Habermas cited the role of the coffee house in the flowering of western thought. These allowed intellectual life to move out of private domains into an argumentative “bourgeois public sphere”. Well, for late-1600s coffee house, read restaurant, bar or indeed coffee house. Something about the neutral setting equalises people and loosens tongues.\n\nSoon after meeting someone, mention Dubai. If it provokes a smirk, and a jibe at the crassness of the place, that is useful. You can filter that person out.\n\nKnocking Dubai took over long ago from knocking LA as the blandest opinion in the world. The case for the Gulf city? The transfer of power from the west is visible there as it is nowhere else: in the Asian big-spenders, in the Russian sanction-dodgers. You needn’t like the place, but to not find it stimulating is to not find this century stimulating.\n\nLots of places are diverse. Dubai is cosmopolitan, to an extent London alone among western cities can touch, and that spirit infuses the old quarter near the airport as much as the bling centre. Looking down at the city, and at new-money Brits who love “Doobs”, has come to characterise a certain kind of box-ticking, not-very-elite elitism, like having an Elena Ferrante on the go.\n\nOf course, someone can be anti-Dubai and interesting, but we don’t have hours on end to find out. We need heuristics, rules of thumb, to triage the original from the generic, and none works better than the Dubai test. (By the way, of the most bankable conversationalists I know, those who most often inspire columns, four live or have lived in Dubai.)\n\nThe top person in an organisation won’t be its most interesting. Hence the emptiness of chief executive philosophising. Managing people and processes requires high intelligence, no doubt, but not so much intellectualism, if that means a taste for abstract thought. Look for people a notch or two down, then: those who were too dreamy to be leadership material.\n\nA caveat: while it is rare for the executive temperament and the intellectual temperament to coexist in one person, it isn’t unheard-of. Isaac Newton ran some important organisations after founding classical mechanics, which I suggest bolsters his claim as the ablest individual who ever lived. (Tossing out statements as sweeping as that is another useful filter, by the way. Interesting people will enjoy running with the question of who was the ablest human being. The pedestrian mind will nitpick. “How can we judge?” etc.)\n\nAnd so to the rule that shapes my life. People don’t know when they are being interesting. Someone will yak away for an hour on their core theme and then, as we settle the bill, mumble something en passant that unlocks an entire column idea. The gold is so often in the digression.\n\nSo while it is true that, compared to those who raised me, I have never done a day’s work, I am condemned to a life of perpetual listening, lest a globule of someone else’s insight gets lost in the wind. A columnist is never “off”. The cost of freedom is said to be eternal vigilance. This charmed job asks much the same price.\n\nEmail Janan at janan.ganesh@ft.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life & Art wherever you listen",

    "blurb": "Bankers hope successful listing of high-end grocer heralds wave of private companies going public",
    "date": "2024-05-0900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Spinneys, the high-end grocer that operates the Waitrose brand in the Gulf, rose as much as 10 per cent on its first day of trading on Thursday — the latest major private company to go public in Dubai and part of what bankers and investors hope could be a wave of such listings.\n\nThe company — named after British army officer turned merchant Arthur Rawdon Spinney, who began importing food into British-occupied Egypt a century ago — said its offering was 64 times oversubscribed and priced at the top end of the range. The shares were later trading up 5 per cent on the day.\n\nBankers say the listing has been closely watched by executives considering launching their own offerings. They believe its success may encourage other private sector companies to come to market in the Middle East’s financial hub Dubai, whose stock exchange has traditionally been dominated by state-linked companies.\n\nSpinneys’ flotation “will hopefully engage other entrepreneurs and families to follow this trend” for large, family-owned businesses to come to market, said Ali Khalpey, Dubai-based head of equity capital markets syndicate at EFG Hermes.\n\nPrivately held schools group Taaleem listed in Dubai in 2022 and Al Ansari Financial Services made its market debut in 2023, the first such listings for years.\n\nGulf supermarket operator LuLu Group has also said it is planning an IPO in the region, without specifying on which exchange.\n\nPreviously, IPOs have been dominated by government-owned companies. Parking operator Parkin listed earlier this year, the most recent state-owned company to do so, while several larger state entities — including Dubai utilities group Dewa — floated in 2022.\n\n“We first saw a lot of government-related entities, that was to deepen the stock market and get more flow,” said Monika Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. “A natural progression of that would be to get more private sector companies coming in.”\n\nFive flotations raised $8.5bn in 2022 in what was a strong year for Dubai IPOs, according to Dealogic data. However, last year there were just two IPOs raising $525mn.\n\nBoth Dubai and Abu Dhabi are pursuing ambitious economic plans as the former tries to expand its economy beyond trade and tourism and the latter looks to diversify away from oil. Both have their own bourses, and are trying to increase the number of listed companies in their capital markets in order to attract investors.\n\nSpinneys, which is majority owned by the Al Bwardy family, priced at Dh1.53 per share and raised Dh1.4bn ($375mn), giving the retailer an implied market capitalisation before trading began of Dh5.5bn ($1.5bn).\n\nAnalysts say the narrow range of stocks listed in Dubai has helped boost demand for the shares.\n\n“Even though people liked the macro economic picture [in the UAE], apart from the banking sector there were limited ways to play the growth story, the outlook and diversification plans,” added Malik. “A company like Spinneys is a way to bet on population growth.”\n\nAsset manager Franklin Templeton is a cornerstone investor in the IPO, alongside Abu Dhabi investment group Emirates International Investment Company.\n\nSpinneys opened its first shop in Dubai in 1961, just as oil discoveries in the United Arab Emirates were opening the petrodollar floodgates, creating enormous wealth and attracting legions of foreign workers.\n\nToday its 75 stores — including those operating under the banner of UK supermarket chain Waitrose — cater mainly to expatriates and wealthy shoppers in the UAE and Oman. The company made revenues of Dh2.9bn in 2023, up 9 per cent from Dh2.6bn the previous year. It made a pre-tax profit of Dh256mn in 2023 and Dh215mn in 2022.\n\nTo boost growth the company is turning to Saudi Arabia, with plans to open its first store in the region’s biggest economy this year, but none under the Waitrose banner, according to chief executive Sunil Kumar.\n\nJohn Lewis-owned Waitrose “don’t want to go further than the UAE”, he said. “The partnership board is not keen until and unless the Saudi market opens up to the new liberal way of John Lewis Partnership.\n\n“There is no liquor permitted in Saudi Arabia. So there is a restriction. There is no pork,” he added.\n\nHowever, Waitrose told the Financial Times that the decision not to expand into Saudi Arabia was not related to prohibited items. Instead, it said it was focused on a £1bn expansion in the UK. “There are logistical challenges of getting into any new market on a significant scale, which aren’t right for us at the moment,” the company added.",

    "blurb": "Head of last year’s climate negotiations holds event in Abu Dhabi for Silicon Valley and oil executives",
    "date": "2024-05-0900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sultan al-Jaber is planning a final flourish as president of the UN COP28 summit by calling the heads of the world’s largest energy and tech companies for climate talks in Abu Dhabi days before COP29 begins in Azerbaijan.\n\nJaber — who is also head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) — said he will invite chief executives from Silicon Valley and Big Oil for a “Change Makers Majlis”, or special gathering, at the start of November to discuss artificial intelligence and the energy transition.\n\n“My message to the tech sector is this: AI needs energy and energy needs AI,” said Jaber, who is also the UAE minister for industry and advanced technology. “Let’s collaborate to drive down the emissions of the conventional energy you will still need, and on ways that AI can drive energy efficiency,” he told the Financial Times.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi event — mirroring the majlis held during the COP28 negotiation — will take place immediately before Adipec, an annual conference also held in the capital that is typically attended by most of the chief executives of global oil majors.\n\nAhead of last year’s COP28 negotiations, some questioned whether Jaber, as head of Adnoc, was a suitable president for the world’s most important climate negotiations.\n\nAntónio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said after the COP summit that tougher action was needed on fossil fuels.\n\nBut in recent months, ahead of passing over the COP presidency to Azerbaijan’s ecology minister Mukhtar Babayev, Jaber has occupied the limelight for his climate role, making speeches at climate conferences. He is due to speak about energy and AI at the Microsoft CEO Summit next week.\n\nThe UAE, Azerbaijan and Brazil, host of COP30, have formed a troika aimed at ensuring progress from one COP to the next.\n\nThe agreements made in Dubai included the first global undertaking to move away from fossil fuels and a commitment to triple renewable energy generation by 2030.\n\nHowever, there has since been little implementation of the pledges. The issue of how to finance the shift to a green economy is still being fiercely debated and is expected to dominate talks at this year’s COP29 in Baku in November.\n\nJaber said he thought AI would be “the bridge” for how the world could simultaneously “reduce emissions while also driving social and economic value everywhere”.\n\nAbu Dhabi has positioned itself as a regional AI hub as it seeks to diversify beyond oil.\n\nAt the same time, the International Energy Agency has estimated that electricity consumed by data centres globally will more than double by 2026 to more than 1,000 terawatt hours, an amount roughly equivalent to what Japan consumes annually. This has also raised concerns about the effect on the environment.\n\n“I know that AI is making grids much smarter by simply predicting peaks and dips and usage, it is also helping optimise the flow of electrons, to where they need to be. There are also exciting new developments happening in material sciences. AI is modelling the ideal molecular structures to absorb CO₂,” Jaber added.",

    "blurb": "Arm of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund also backs launch of new stock exchange in South American nation",
    "date": "2024-05-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Capital intends to invest about $13.5bn on a major biofuels project in Brazil over the next decade, under broader plans for the country that include the creation of a new stock exchange.\n\nThe asset management arm of the Emirati sovereign wealth fund is increasing its bets on Latin America’s largest economy, where its holdings span metro lines and medical universities to a majority stake in the local owner of the Burger King brand — alongside Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Mubadala Capital’s head of Brazil revealed for the first time the full budget of its flagship scheme to produce renewable diesel and “sustainable” aviation kerosene mainly using non-food plant matter.\n\nThe large-scale development by its energy company, Acelen, will comprise five $2.7bn “modules”, with the first due to begin production by the end of 2026. Each will consist of a new biorefinery with capacity to process 20,000 barrels of fuel per day, associated infrastructure and planted areas to grow the input crop.\n\n“It’s all about feedstock [which] in reality is agriculture. And Brazil is probably the best-placed country on the planet when it comes to agricultural proficiency because of the climate and the fertile soil,” said Oscar Fahlgren. “Brazil is to agriculture what Abu Dhabi is to oil.”\n\nThe initiative will also involve the conversion of an existing oil refinery in the north-eastern Brazilian state of Bahia acquired from state-controlled Petrobras in 2021. An expected total amount of $13.5bn is to be funded through a mix of equity and debt over a period of five to 10 years, said Fahlgren.\n\n“It’s a very important capital project,” he added. “I see tremendous opportunity to invest in the green energy transition space in Brazil.”\n\nThe group had previously only announced the estimated cost for the development’s initial module. Mubadala Capital’s bioenergy play will build on its $6bn of investments in the country, which represents about a quarter of the group’s global portfolio.\n\nTwo-thirds of its capital in Brazil is from outside investors, with the remainder from parent organisation Mubadala. Its focus there is on businesses in situations of complexity or distress.\n\nThe eponymous sovereign fund first entered the South American nation in 2012 with a $2bn investment backing former tycoon Eike Batista, once one of the world’s wealthiest people before the meltdown of his energy and commodities empire the following year.\n\nIn the fallout, Mubadala ended up the main creditor of Batista’s holding group EBX and took ownership of several of his assets, including stakes in ports and mines.\n\nToday its portfolio includes a company that organises the São Paulo Formula 1 Grand Prix. Fahlgren described Mubadala’s approach in the country as “contrarian”, having remained through economic and political crises in the past decade.\n\n“We’ve been very active investing in Brazil, for the past 10-plus years, in an environment where most foreign investors have been shying away,” he said.\n\nMubadala Capital had fully invested its second Brazil-focused fund that closed with $710mn of commitments last year, he added. Americas Trading Group, a financial assets trading platform it purchased in 2023, hopes to open a bourse in Brazil next year to rival the incumbent B3 in São Paulo.\n\n“Brazil is a very large country. It has only one stock exchange. And I think that’s suboptimal infrastructure for the players that operate in this segment,” said Fahlgren. “It will probably be a staged launch — perhaps start with equities, then expand. No asset classes are off the table.”\n\nAnother focus is Zamp, which franchises Burger King restaurants in Brazil. Mubadala Capital has steadily increased its stake to 58 per cent and recently elected a majority of seats on the board, which now also includes an executive from fellow shareholder Affinity Partners, the private equity firm run by Jared Kushner. Affinity’s investment was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nFahlgren said he was “very happy” with the partnership with Affinity. “It just happened and we have no other specific investments earmarked, but I wouldn’t rule it out,” he added.\n\nMubadala Capital is also involved in talks for a proposed new football league in Brazil whose goal is to package up and sell the commercial rights.\n\n“We’re very bullish on the investment climate in Brazil right now and the opportunities we see,” said Fahlgren. “We do have a number of assets that are relatively mature today, and could be potential exit candidates in the not too distant future,” he added.\n\n",

    "blurb": "Culture secretary says UK ‘not stopping’ foreign investment as she defends blocking sale to Abu Dhabi-backed company ",
    "date": "2024-05-0300:00:00.0",
    "body": "UK culture secretary Lucy Frazer has demanded fortnightly updates on the sale of the Telegraph newspaper to encourage a speedy resolution to a saga that she describes as one of the most “intense” periods of her ministerial career.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Frazer defended the decision to block the sale of the media group to an Abu Dhabi-backed company but insisted it was not a signal the government was turning its back on investment from the region.\n\n“It’s really important to make clear that we are open for business,” said Frazer, who will travel to Saudi Arabia this month to drum up business for the UK cultural sector. She said letting the Gulf kingdom invest in British culture was “totally different” to allowing foreign states to own UK newspapers.\n\n“This is a fundamental principle about freedom of our newspapers,” said Frazer, adding that she had asked for biweekly updates on the sale of the Telegraph Media Group from RedBird IMI. “It’s really important we don’t impinge on democracy. In every other area — football [for example] — we’re not stopping foreign investment.”\n\nFrazer, culture secretary since last year, led efforts in government to first scrutinise and then change the law to block the takeover of the Telegraph Media Group by RedBird IMI, by barring overseas states from taking large stakes in the UK newspaper group.\n\nThe deal for the Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph and Spectator titles became a political flashpoint, with MPs and peers voicing concerns over a foreign power exerting influence over a UK media group with strong links to the Conservative party.\n\nThis week RedBird IMI — a joint venture between US private equity firm RedBird and Abu Dhabi-based International Media Investments — said it would withdraw its offer and launch an auction in a bid to recoup the £600mn it paid for the broadsheet titles and the Spectator magazine.\n\n“I was very conscious at every stage that the future of the Telegraph was potentially in my hands,” she said, adding that the sale of the newspaper by Lloyds Banking Group jump-started a frantic effort in Whitehall to ensure it did not fall under the influence of a foreign power.\n\n“We worked as a department for about three weeks, nonstop over weekends, up till the early hours,” Frazer said. “It’s impossible for others to understand the intensity . . . the sense of importance of the decisions that we’re taking.”\n\nRedBird IMI, which derives about three-quarters of its funding from Abu Dhabi but is managed by US executives, promised to maintain editorial independence of the Telegraph.\n\nBut Frazer said the deal raised a “matter of principle” over foreign state ownership of newspapers. “A foreign state is likely to buy a newspaper, not as a commercial entity, but to ensure that it gets very full coverage in a particular country. It’s a pillar of democracy that you should be able to report without fear or favour,” she said.\n\nRedBird IMI chief Jeff Zucker branded rivals for the titles hypocrites for attacking his bid, citing previous attempts by them to court RedBird IMI as part of bids for Telegraph Media Group. People close to the group also said the press in the UK was often heavily influenced by wealthy owners.\n\nMPs and media executives are now concerned that there will be months more uncertainty over the ownership of the Telegraph in the run-up to the general election expected this year.\n\nFrazer said she wanted an onward sale “as soon as possible”. Responsibility for the sale rests with RedBird IMI, which needs to sell the debt behind the group with the option of converting into ownership.\n\n“There’s a huge amount of uncertainty for the Telegraph at the moment and has been for some time. If there is a significant matter that arises between those 14 days, I would like to be updated on it,” she added.\n\nFrazer confirmed that the government would seek to cap any ownership by a foreign state of a newspaper group at 5 per cent, but added that she would consult on the plans first to ensure the new law had no “unintended consequences”, although this would not include the 5 per cent limit.\n\nSome media owners are concerned that the cap would make it impossible to finance future deals, or risk hitting passive sovereign wealth fund shareholders that already have stakes in listed UK and US companies.\n\nBut Frazer said 5 per cent seemed the right level to ensure no undue influence over a newspaper group, adding: “We don’t want to restrict all investment. What we are stopping is investing in a newspaper for the purpose of influencing the editorial.”\n\nFrazer said the law would not be imposed retrospectively, which means it could not be used to review previous deals, such as a sale of large stakes in the Evening Standard and the Independent to a Saudi businessman.\n\nFrazer will have a chance later this month to demonstrate that her handling of the Abu Dhabi-backed bid for the Telegraph does not signal a move towards a more inward-looking approach to foreign investment.\n\nFor two days from May 14 she will be among ministers leading a cultural and business delegation, expected to include representatives of bodies such as the Royal Opera House and Science Museum, to Riyadh seeking Saudi investment.\n\n“I think there will be lots of discussions about how the Saudis can learn from the UK and there will be discussions about investment by the Saudis into UK companies,” Frazer said.\n\nShe said engagement with Saudi Arabia “brings benefits to them, exports our soft power abroad and brings investment into the country”.\n\nFrazer acknowledged that London was engaged in a battle for Saudi investment with Paris, noting: “The French have spent a lot of time exporting their culture abroad.”\n\nAsked if she would advise her hosts in Riyadh that they would be better off putting their money into British cultural institutions, Frazer said: “Of course. Our culture is the best in the world and we don’t want the French stealing a march on us.”",

    "body": "Visitors to Dubai’s Mall of the Emirates’ famous artificial ski slope last week found it dark and deserted. Even though the shopping centre itself was filled with the usual tourists, the silent snow dome suggested all was not well, after a deluge in the metropolis disrupted the power to chill the slope.\n\nSeveral days after the United Arab Emirates was drenched by historically intense rainfall, many streets surrounding the pristine mall were covered by water.\n\nAbandoned cars, including a Porsche Carrera, littered nearby roads. Local residents, whose buildings still had no power or running water, crouched by the mall’s power sockets and washed in its public toilets.\n\nThe disruption in the wake of the dramatic storm, which caused flash flooding across the oil-exporting country, brought home the growing threat of intensifying weather events to the desert nation’s infrastructure.\n\nMany services have returned to normal. But water was still standing in some areas more than a week after the storm and the UAE issued health advice about the stagnant pools, which have turned foul smelling. Dubai’s rulers have pledged to spend Dh2bn ($545mn) on patching up damage.\n\n“Traditionally Dubai and the UAE have not had to worry about getting too much rain, so it hasn’t been part of their planning calculus,” said an expert on climate resilience and urban environments who works with Middle East governments. “That will have to change”.\n\n“You would not think, being here, setting up a store, you have to think: waterproofing,” said Somia Anwar, co-owner of Bookends, a used books seller. As water gushed into their basement-level shop last week, “I felt like I was in the Titanic”. After the water was pumped out, Anwar had to dispose of 10,000 books spoiled by sewage water, which was not covered by insurance.\n\nScientists said heavy rainfall in years when the naturally occurring El Niño pattern warms the Pacific Ocean had become anywhere from 10 per cent to 40 per cent more severe, in a rapid study by the World Weather Attribution group.\n\nWhile the researchers could not precisely determine how much of the increase in such wet weather was due to human-caused climate change, they found that warming caused by burning fossil fuels was the most likely explanation.\n\nNot only does climate change mean the UAE has to contend with ever hotter summers as temperatures reach beyond 50C, it also faces the wetter weather fuelled by global warming.\n\nAlthough the sudden rainfall was the heaviest since records began 75 years ago, according to meteorological authorities, it was just the most recent deluge. Inundation has become frequent enough that Dubai’s transport authority opened a flood management control centre in January.\n\n“They are not rare events for the Middle East,” said Suzanne Gray, professor of meteorology and Reading University in the UK, who identified the tempest as being caused by an amalgamation of several high level thunderstorms, called a mesoscale convective system, typically hundreds of kilometres wide.\n\nScientists said that cloud seeding, a technique used by the UAE to help stimulate rain, was not to blame.\n\n“We know that man-made climate increases extreme rainfall — this is well understood physics as warm air holds more water,” said John Marsham, Met Office joint chair at the University of Leeds. “Any possible effect of any cloud seeding in these circumstances would be tiny.”\n\nWith the UAE hosting the COP28 climate summit last year, awareness has grown about climate change dangers. The country has an adaptation plan, and Dubai was the first to apply for a UN scheme to become a “City Resilience Hub” in 2020.\n\nUAE capital Abu Dhabi weathered the latest storm better than the larger glitzy trading and financial hub of Dubai. The futuristic city is the UAE’s biggest by population and the location of the world’s second busiest airport, which was forced to cancel more than 1,000 flights, leaving passengers stranded for days.\n\n“The infrastructure was built before these weather changes happened,” said an insurance executive, who said it was too early to estimate overall damage costs. “In certain instances, the quality of construction by the developers was not good enough.”\n\nSprawling Dubai was especially vulnerable to flooding because it was relatively flat, covered in impermeable concrete and asphalt surfaces, and its desert sands lacked the ability to grow vegetation that could absorb floodwater, said a Dubai-based town planning specialist.\n\nUnderlying those drainage problems is a groundwater table already oversaturated by irrigation and pipe leakage, a common issue in the Gulf. “The cities are really floating,” said Hrvoje Cindrić, Middle East planning lead at international engineering firm Buro Happold.\n\nWhen Dubai floods, he added, “the water has got nowhere to go”.\n\nDubai officials over the years have considered comprehensive drainage systems but carried out limited works because of the high costs involved versus the perceived relatively low risk.\n\nUpgrades to the network have included a 10km drainage tunnel under southern Dubai, opened ahead of Expo 2020, to serve the huge exhibition facilities, which was also the site of the UN climate summit, and the airport.\n\n“You wouldn’t engineer for the worst possible scenario . . . it’s prohibitively expensive,” said Huda Shaka, a chartered urban planner based in Dubai. But following the storm, “it’s not just a theoretical scenario. It has happened, and the costs are real.”\n\nIn the wake of the floods, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed al-Maktoum, the crown prince, approved a Dh66bn upgrade to the drain network. Tenders were first issued last year for the project, though bids were not received until February.\n\nThe announcement came after the UAE president Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan ordered officials to monitor the nation’s infrastructure and “limit the damage caused,” according to the state news agency.\n\nTown planning experts say Dubai could adopt “sponge city” principles, making detailed flooding plans and allotting areas with permeable surfaces for better drainage. Given the damage sustained by many buildings, “there may be a need for tougher building codes,” said a former Emirati official.\n\n“Now the cost of mitigating [extreme weather] becomes not unreasonable,” said urban planner Shaka, adding: “sometimes it takes an extreme event for action to happen.”",

    "body": "The Biden administration is proactively encouraging US tech groups to seek artificial intelligence deals and partnerships in the United Arab Emirates, seeking to cultivate an alliance that would provide it with an edge over China in developing the revolutionary technology.\n\nThis week, Microsoft announced a $1.5bn investment in G42, an Abu Dhabi-based AI group chaired by powerful Emirati royal Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed al-Nahyan, representing the tech giant’s latest huge bet on AI.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the discussions, the deal was finalised following a series of meetings over the past year brokered by the US government between investors and companies from the UAE and American tech companies including Microsoft, Google and OpenAI.\n\nThe talks are part of Washington’s efforts to achieve supremacy over Beijing in the development of artificial intelligence and other sensitive technologies.\n\nCommerce secretary Gina Raimondo has been closely involved, a person briefed on the negotiations said, as the highest levels of the US government worked to develop closer ties between American tech groups and Abu Dhabi.\n\nAnother critical figure is Sheikh Tahnoon, the UAE’s national security adviser who also oversees a business empire and Abu Dhabi’s biggest sovereign wealth fund. He spearheads the nation’s burgeoning AI efforts as G42’s chair and was photographed presiding over the deal-signing with Microsoft.\n\nThe US-UAE meetings show how the fight to dominate emerging technologies has become geopolitical, as commercial decisions have become intertwined with national strategic and security interests.\n\nOil-rich Abu Dhabi has cultivated ambitions to deploy its vast petrodollar wealth to be at the heart of the global development of AI as it works to lessen its dependence on fossil fuels. It has launched MGX, a fund dedicated to AI deals, and is also expected to spend billions on research and development through government organisations such as the Advanced Technology Research Council.\n\nAI leaders, including OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman and chipmaker Nvidia’s chief executive Jensen Huang, have become regular visitors to the Gulf state.\n\nAltman has travelled between the UAE and Washington this month, meeting government officials and investors to discuss how AI companies and governments in both countries can work together.\n\nThe OpenAI founder has discussed plans over an ambitious chip venture with Sheikh Tahnoon, seeking to raise billions of dollars to develop the semiconductors required to train and build AI models, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nAltman has also met America’s ambassador to the UAE, Martina Strong and members of Congress and the US national security community to ensure there is enough energy, chips and data centre capacity to support the AI boom, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations.\n\nWhile seeking stronger ties, US officials had previously expressed unease over the UAE’s use of Chinese technology, particularly Huawei’s 5G hardware, worried that China could use these networks to access information from an important US ally.\n\nUS lawmakers had scrutinised G42’s links to Chinese companies, over concern that the company could provide a route for US AI technology and Americans’ genetic data to reach the Chinese government and companies. G42’s chief executive Peng Xiao was born in China, studied in the US and is now a UAE citizen.\n\nDuring a visit to Washington last year, Sheikh Tahnoon told his counterparts that he wanted to work towards a framework after Abu Dhabi took a “strategic decision” to focus on US tech, according to a person briefed on the UAE’s strategy.\n\n“The UAE views data as the new oil,” the person said. “It realised that it had to find a new way to exist between the US and China because of US concerns about Chinese tech.\n\n“They’ve since been having very productive conversations, with Raimondo in particular,” the person added.\n\nGiven the sensitivities around national security, approval for the G42-Microsoft deal took months of talks with government officials on both sides, two people close to the negotiations said.\n\nOne of those people said the deal involved G42 pledging to remove Chinese technology — most importantly, hardware built by Huawei — from its systems.\n\nXiao told the Financial Times late last year that it was cutting links with Chinese partners in order to prioritise relationships with US companies, saying: “We are in a position where we have to make a choice . . . we cannot work with both sides.”\n\nThe FT reported earlier this year that the group’s venture capital arm had also divested its Chinese holdings.\n\nG42’s deal with Microsoft means it will have to abide by US regulations. The two have signed an “Intergovernmental Assurance Agreement”, which the companies said was drawn up in “close consultation” with Washington and Abu Dhabi.\n\n“Both companies will move forward with a commitment to comply with US and international trade, security, responsible AI and business integrity laws and regulations,” G42 and Microsoft said in a statement.\n\nBrad Smith, Microsoft’s vice-chair and president, told the FT the investment “reflects confidence by our company in the UAE as a country, in G42 as a company, and in Peng as its CEO”.\n\nThe Microsoft-G42 deal appears to be the start of a broader alliance between the US and UAE over AI.\n\nThe commercial agreement represents “a starting place to define the contours of the government-to-government co-operation and partnerships”, said a person familiar with the UAE’s thinking. They added: “The UAE is not giving up on China tech and is working to manage that relationship, but there are going to be limits on the UAE’s ability to co-operate with the Chinese on tech.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Stephen Morris in San Francisco",

    "body": "Travel chaos roiled the world’s busiest international airport in Dubai for a third day, after a record-breaking storm which hit the United Arab Emirates caused the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights.\n\nThe UAE experienced its heaviest rains in the 75 years on record on Tuesday, flooding critical infrastructure and causing unprecedented flight cancellations and delays at one of the world’s most important travel hubs.\n\nAirlines have been forced to cancel 1,145 flights since Tuesday, about a third of the scheduled departures and arrivals at Dubai airport, according to data from Flightradar24.\n\nDubai airport on Thursday said it was slowly resuming operations, including at terminals serving both Emirates and international carriers.\n\nBut it warned that “flights continue to be delayed and disrupted” and told passengers only to travel to the airport if they had received confirmation their flight was operating, amid a “high volume of guests”.\n\nTravellers continued to upload pictures of chaotic scenes at the airport. “It remains an incredibly challenging time. In living memory, I don’t think anyone has ever seen conditions like it,” Dubai Airport’s boss Paul Griffiths told the BBC.\n\nAmong the affected travellers were attendees at a major cryptocurrency conference in Dubai, Token2049.\n\nSome conference goers complained of having spent hours waiting in Dubai airport on Tuesday and Wednesday due to severe shortages of onward transportation.\n\nAnd others who had arrived at the weekend, had battled delayed or lengthy rerouted flights due to airspace closures across the region during Iran’s attack on Israel.\n\nDubai has grown over the past 30 years from a minor regional airport into the world’s busiest international hub, as the Gulf has become a major force in global aviation.\n\nAirlines are scheduled to fly seats for nearly 5mn passengers on flights to and from Dubai in April, almost 1mn more than the second busiest international airport at London Heathrow, according to industry data provider OAG.\n\nWhen accounting for domestic flights too, Dubai is the second busiest in the world, behind Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson.\n\nEmirates uses Dubai as a hub to connect transiting passengers on intercontinental flights around the world, in a model that has also been taken up by regional rivals including Turkish Airlines and Qatar Airways.\n\nThe airline did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday, but on social media it said customers departing from Dubai were able to check into their flights as of Thursday morning.",

    "body": "An intense storm has caused travel havoc across the United Arab Emirates, forcing the cancellation of flights at the world’s second-busiest aviation hub and leaving passengers stranded as flooding disrupted roads and public transport.\n\nThe UAE has experienced its heaviest rains in the 75 years for which it has kept weather records, according to meteorological authorities. One Emirati man was reportedly killed in flash flooding in Ras Al Khaimah. In neighbouring Oman, where dangerous storms are more frequent, more than a dozen people were reported killed.\n\nIn Dubai, operations at the airport, a global travel hub, were severely disrupted, while vehicles were submerged in poorly drained slip roads and tunnels, highlighting the vulnerability of the region’s financial centre to extreme weather.\n\nFlood waters cascaded through malls on Tuesday, while in the most violent periods of the storm, furniture was hurled from balconies while the sky turned green. The rising waters flooded villas in the city’s desert outskirts, where residents were canoeing and jet-skiing along submerged roads.\n\nDubai officials are concerned about the growing frequency of large-scale storms in the city, where drainage systems are overcome during periods of heavy rainfall. Scientists have predicted that climate change will make the lower Gulf region hotter, more humid and more prone to flooding.\n\nA government body that oversees cloud seeding — which the UAE uses to manage precipitation — was forced to deny its involvement in the extreme weather. The National Center of Meteorology told CNBC news that it had not deployed pilots before or during the storm.\n\nAlthough sunshine prevailed by Wednesday, Dubai airport, the world’s second-busiest aviation centre, advised people “NOT to come to the airport, unless absolutely necessary”, and Dubai airline Emirates suspended check-in for passengers until midnight on Wednesday. In-bound flights were diverted as the storm raged on Tuesday night.\n\nFlooding on Tuesday covered large parts of the UAE’s road network, leaving standing water on Wednesday. Public transport has been severely disrupted, with many metro stations in Dubai closed on Wednesday.\n\nGovernment employees and students have been told to stay at home, while waterlogged golf courses remained closed.\n\nThe oil-rich UAE is seeking to reduce its dependence on exports of fossil fuels, the biggest contributor to global warming. Dubai hosted the COP28 climate summit last year, where a historic agreement was reached to establish a “loss and damage” fund for poorer nations and to “transition away” from fossil fuels. Abu Dhabi is currently hosting an assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency.\n\nMarissa Grobler, consul general of Namibia to UAE, was caught in the centre of the storm’s destructive impact in the desert region between the cities of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Al Ain.\n\nLocated in one of several areas that received twice the nation’s average annual rainfall in one day, her family slept in a bathroom overnight as high winds tore off the roof of her newly built home.\n\n“A concrete wall came down, smashed like Lego, and debris destroyed our cars,” said Grobler, who runs a quarantine facility for endangered species. “Parts of our roof are literally on another farm one kilometre away.”\n\nHer neighbours, a group of workers, were now homeless after their less-secure buildings were completely destroyed, she said. By Wednesday, phone and internet connectivity had been restored in her neighbourhood but electricity remained down.\n\nAt Grobler’s facility, a large aviary was broken apart while other animals, including meerkats and gazelle, either drowned or escaped when walls collapsed. “It’s crazy. I have never seen anything of this magnitude,” said Grobler, who has lived in the UAE for 23 years and grew up in neighbouring Oman.\n\n",

    "blurb": "Agreement is latest move by US tech company to extend its reach into fast-growing sector",
    "date": "2024-04-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Microsoft has agreed to invest $1.5bn in Abu Dhabi artificial intelligence group G42, its latest big bet on the technology that underscores deepening collaboration between the US and United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe agreement gives Microsoft a minority stake in G42, and its vice-chair and president Brad Smith will have a seat on its board. It comes after G42 severed its links to Chinese hardware suppliers, which had been the subject of scrutiny by US lawmakers.\n\nThe investment will strengthen Abu Dhabi’s position as an AI hub, and is a sign of the oil-rich emirate’s ambitions in the technology. It also shows how the Gulf, long seen by many in Silicon Valley as an easy source of funding, is increasingly regarded as a credible technology partner.\n\n“Given the importance of the technology and given how important it is to the two countries and two governments, we’ve taken this first step in close collaboration with the governments of both the UAE and the United States,” Smith said. “We will take the next step and following steps in close collaboration with them as well.”\n\nAsked if the Microsoft deal was a prize for cutting ties with China, G42’s chief executive Peng Xiao said: “I would focus on our decision to form this partnership with Microsoft to really develop our capabilities on a global scale. Less focus on what we choose not to do.”\n\nThe deal has required negotiation with the Biden administration, amid concern from US lawmakers about G42’s links to China including whether the data of American citizens could be passed to the Chinese government.\n\nG42 said that “after deciding to partner with Microsoft last year, we began meetings with US officials to ensure compliance with US regulations — including on Chinese technology — so we could get the deal over the line”. Another person close to the negotiations said G42 had agreed to pull all hardware made by China’s Huawei from its systems.\n\nAs part of the deal, G42 would use Microsoft’s cloud computing platform Azure “as the backbone for the development and deployment of AI services we provide to all of our customers”, said Xiao.\n\nSmith said the companies planned to partner at a later stage on building out data centres in other countries. They will also support a $1bn fund for AI developers.\n\n“Microsoft’s large investment is not something we do without a lot of thought,” Smith added. “And this decision reflects confidence by our company in the UAE as a country, in G42 as a company, and in Peng as its CEO.”\n\nChaired by the UAE’s powerful national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who oversees a sprawling business empire, G42 is central to Abu Dhabi’s AI ambitions and is backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign investor Mubadala.\n\nG42’s companies range from data centres to healthcare, and it has produced an Arabic large language model called Jais.\n\nAI leaders have been increasingly drawn to Abu Dhabi by its grand plans and deep pockets. It recently launched an investment company dedicated to AI deals, called MGX.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has visited several times, including this month, and has held discussions with UAE investors including Sheikh Tahnoon for a scheme to boost chip production, likely to cost billions of dollars.\n\nSeattle-headquartered Microsoft is OpenAI’s main partner, having invested $13bn in the start-up, much of it in the form of credits for Microsoft’s cloud.\n\nMicrosoft is positioning itself at the centre of an AI boom following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. It says it sees the G42 investment as a launch pad to other regions.\n\n“By coming together, I think we can accelerate very substantially the arrival of AI services in the Global South,” said Smith.\n\nSatya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, regards AI dominance as critical to getting ahead of rivals, and a way to eat into arch-rival Google’s dominance in search.\n\nNadella has sought to corner the market by investing heavily. Last month, Microsoft struck a $650mn deal to hire the founders and dozens of researchers and engineers at AI start-up Inflection.\n\nMicrosoft has been the biggest spender during an investment frenzy over the past 18 months. According to private markets data provider PitchBook, investment into generative AI roughly quadrupled between 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe bulk of the $27bn raised by AI start-ups last year came from big tech companies. As well as Microsoft’s $10bn investment in OpenAI, Amazon and Google agreed multibillion-dollar deals with Anthropic, another San Francisco-headquartered AI company.",

    "body": "The UK government has ruled out any direct foreign state ownership of a British newspaper in a strongly worded amendment to a law that would in effect block Abu Dhabi-backed RedBird IMI’s takeover of Telegraph Media Group.\n\nDirect investment in UK newspapers of any size by a foreign state will be banned under the new regime being drawn up by Whitehall officials, according to a legislative amendment published by the government on Thursday.\n\nMinisters are also pushing for a more strongly worded definition of foreign state, and the extent to which it could be seen to have control or influence, than the national security act when applying to a newspaper or a news magazine.\n\nRedBird IMI is already considering a potential sale of the Telegraph following the government’s move last week to prevent any foreign state from owning or having influence or control over a British newspaper.\n\nPossible bidders are being sounded out should it come back for auction, and the joint venture between US fund manager RedBird Capital and Abu Dhabi investment vehicle International Media Investments could alternatively bring in other investors to replace Abu Dhabi funds, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nUnder the proposed amendment, the definition of foreign power will refer to the head of a foreign state, a foreign government or part of a foreign government, an agency of a foreign government, authorities responsible for administering the affairs of an area within a foreign country, governing political parties, and officers of governing political parties.\n\nThe restriction will also apply to ownership, control or influence of newspapers and news magazines by associated individuals other than the sovereign or head of state and ministers investing their private wealth, in order to capture all possible ways in which a foreign state could seek to secure control or influence over a UK newspaper or news magazine.\n\nIf passed, the changes to legislation going through parliament would in effect prevent the £600mn takeover of the Telegraph by RedBird IMI.\n\nThe government will, however, be introducing a narrow and specific exemption for passive investments below a certain threshold, via secondary legislation.\n\nThis will allow the so-called passive stakes held by sovereign wealth funds owned by countries such as Norway in listed British media groups, for example.\n\nIMI, which is controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and owner of Manchester City football club, provided about three-quarters of the funding to RedBird IMI. RedBird IMI declined to comment.\n\nThe amendment presented by the government on Thursday follows the publication of a letter to the bidding vehicle for RedBird IMI detailing the reasons why culture secretary Lucy Frazer is expected to refer the sale of the Telegraph to a phase 2 investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, the antitrust watchdog.\n\nThe in-depth regulatory review will give the UK government more time to change the law to formally block the deal, which includes the Spectator magazine and was opposed by a number of MPs and peers.\n\nThe letter refers to a report by Ofcom, the media watchdog, citing concerns over public interest issues around the deal. Ofcom said there was “evidence of the UAE government’s approach to freedom of expression which, given its close ties with IMI, may indicate IMI’s propensity to exercise influence to curtail freedom of expression in the Telegraph titles”.\n\nIt added that “IMI has clear political and broader commercial incentives to influence the editorial line of the Telegraph titles, particularly in matters relating to the UAE and its broader political and commercial interests . . . in a way which could negatively affect the accurate presentation of news and free expression of opinion”.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, National World, the regional media group, said it was interested in any future sale of the Telegraph, describing itself as the “best qualified among the various candidates” to own the rival company.",

    "body": "Leading European and UK artificial intelligence start-ups have been lobbied to move their headquarters to rival nations, as they become targets in a global competition to develop cutting-edge technology.\n\nGermany’s Aleph Alpha and UK-based Synthesia and StabilityAI are among the fledgling AI companies that have been approached by officials from Canada and the United Arab Emirates in recent months, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe tech groups have been offered subsidies, lenient tax regimes and light-touch regulation in an effort to persuade them to move locations, these people said.\n\n“We already have been approached by people from outside the European Union asking us basically: ‘Oh, now with all that horrible regulation, don’t you want to move your AI R&D company?’” said Jonas Andrulis, founder and chief executive of Aleph Alpha.\n\nA person close to the German company, which is among Europe’s best-funded AI start-ups, said it had been approached about moves to Canada, UAE, Singapore, the UK and Denmark.\n\nThe concerted push to attract Europe’s most promising AI companies is part of the ambition of states beyond the tech superpowers of the US and China to become serious players in the burgeoning AI industry.\n\nCanada is already home to thousands of AI start-ups, such as Cohere, and leading researchers including Turing award winner Yoshua Bengio. It has sought to encourage AI companies and researchers to the country with policies that speed up immigration, and research and development credits.\n\nCaptain AI, which sells AI software to restaurants, is in the process of relocating from London to Canada, in a move being made to prioritise its customer base in North America.\n\n“Companies who choose to come to Canada do so because we have a competitive economic environment and because we are a global player in artificial intelligence,” said François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s minister of innovation, science and industry.\n\nThe UAE is also hoping to position itself as a global hub for emerging technology, offering long-term “golden visas” to AI talent and opening up its large language model Falcon for researchers and commercial use.\n\nPeople close to Synthesia and Stability said the UAE has also offered generous tax rebates, as well as through the creation of its Hub71 tech hub in Abu Dhabi, backed by Mubadala Ventures, which is intended to attract start-ups to the city.\n\nOmar Sultan al Olama, the UAE’s AI minister, said more than 1,000 companies with a focus on AI were now operating in the Gulf state. He added that the country was aiming for a “just right scenario” on regulation, that was neither too soft nor too hard, while ensuring companies operating in the UAE were compliant when selling into other markets.\n\nRival nations have suggested AI start-ups face less strenuous regulation than in Europe.\n\nThe EU approved its AI Act last week, considered one of the world’s strictest regimes over the technology, causing companies that offer services to European consumers to scale up compliance teams.\n\n“This is a cost that weighs heavy on some of those companies, in addition to high energy costs and an overall high burden of regulation,” said Aleph Alpha’s Andrulis. “So it’s not ideal. I would have preferred that we focus on innovating first because innovation will secure our space in the future.”\n\nThe UK has taken a more relaxed approach, relying on existing industry regulators to create rules around AI, rather than drafting bespoke new legislation. However, most UK-based AI companies are subject to the EU’s AI Act because they operate in the bloc.\n\nParis-based Mistral was vocal in its criticism of the AI Act as it was being drafted. The company lobbied the French government during the negotiations, saying the strict rules would prevent European start-ups from competing with US-based giants. Mistral declined to comment on whether it had been approached over moves away from France.\n\nThe EU law’s advocates, including competition watchdogs and civil society groups, said tougher regulation was necessary to prevent the potential harms caused by the rapidly accelerating technology.\n\nDespite the approaches, Synthesia’s chief executive and co-founder Victor Riparbelli said it had no intention to move from the UK because the country offered a “strong international talent pool, world-leading universities in AI and the best funding environment in Europe”.\n\nAleph Alpha also said it was committed to its headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany, and supporting “European values” and “the European ecosystem”.\n\n“We successfully hire people from the US tech giants [and] bring them to Heidelberg,” Andrulis said. “I pitch it to our international hires as the German Tuscany.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Javier Espinoza in Brussels and Leila Abboud in Paris",

    "body": "A new Abu Dhabi investment company is in talks to back OpenAI’s ambitious chip venture, in the latest effort by the United Arab Emirates to become a global powerbroker in the development of artificial intelligence.\n\nState-funded MGX is in early stage discussions over a funding deal with OpenAI, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The US start-up’s chief executive Sam Altman is seeking to launch a semiconductor business to reduce its dependence on cutting-edge chips made by Nvidia.\n\nEstimates from Altman and others of the cost of building out AI infrastructure have varied from hundreds of billions of dollars to as high as $7tn over the coming years.\n\nSuch figures price out traditional technology venture capitalists, leading the group to approach nation-states. The Financial Times this month reported that OpenAI was also holding talks with Singapore-backed Temasek over a funding deal.\n\nMGX, an AI-focused fund that launched this week, is chaired by the UAE’s powerful national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The nation is betting its wealth, abundant energy resources and the political backing of the autocratic state’s leadership give it a head start in the race to become a global AI hub.\n\n“They’re looking at creating a structure that will put Abu Dhabi at the centre of this AI strategy with global partners around the world,” said a person briefed on the fund.\n\nThe UAE’s AI minister Omar Sultan Al Olama told the FT that Tesla chief Elon Musk — who has launched xAI, a company building AI models in an effort to rival OpenAI — was also interested in partnerships with the Gulf state.\n\n“I do see him [Musk] doing something [AI-related] here,” said Olama, adding that he first met the billionaire in 2017 and has done so multiple times since. “I don’t think it’s far out for him to do something here,” said Olama. “The economics are going to dictate what he and others do here.”\n\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon, a brother of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, oversees a sprawling $1.5tn empire that includes two sovereign wealth funds as well as private businesses.\n\nHe chairs G42, a UAE-based group of AI-focused companies, which is backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign investment fund Mubadala and boasts partnerships with OpenAI, Microsoft and Cerebras.\n\nBy setting up MGX, in partnership with G42 and Mubadala, Sheikh Tahnoon said in a statement that Abu Dhabi was establishing a “national champion” for AI that would “further advance the UAE’s role as a home and ecosystem for top technology talent, investors and entrepreneurs”.\n\nAI’s top players such as Altman and Nvidia chief Jensen Huang have been attracted by the UAE’s ambition and financial firepower. The Gulf nation was an early mover in the nascent industry, appointing the world’s first AI minister in 2017 and opening the world’s first AI-focused graduate university two years later. The state has “been talking about AI since before it was cool”, said Altman at an event in Abu Dhabi last year.\n\nOlama said the country also has a “backlog” of expensive Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), the semiconductors used to power large language models.\n\n“We need to constantly increase the stockpile to match with the ambitions that we have and the direction that we’re going in,” said the AI minister. “[T]here’s going to be a constant flow of investment from the UAE in this domain”\n\nYet the UAE’s plans have also required navigating the trade tensions between the US and China. In particular, Washington has raised concerns about G42 and its ties to Chinese companies including Huawei, which have been blacklisted by the US.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon visited Washington in June, where he discussed issues including “the importance of building trusted technology ecosystems”, according to the White House. Following his trip, the UAE took a strategic decision to prioritise access to US tech partners, people familiar with the leadership’s thinking said.\n\nG42 has since cut off its China partners and sold off its investments in the country — the latter move welcomed by Mike Gallagher, chair of the House select committee on the Chinese Communist party, who has been a vocal critic of the Abu Dhabi-based company.\n\nOlama said the UAE was not making a political decision to favour the US over China in any AI-related venture. “The UAE does not have an agenda that we’re only going to work with one partner . . . It’s always economics.”\n\nHe added: “We want to ensure that AI is being applied in ways that are non-controversial, that can help us in the long term, that are responsible and are led by Emiratis if we can. And if not, that we work with the best partner globally.”",

    "date": "2024-02-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "A key figure in the Dubai-based “super cartel” that supplied a third of Europe’s cocaine has been sentenced to life in prison by a Dutch court as international prosecutors close in on other drugs bosses still at large.\n\nRidouan Taghi, a Moroccan-born Dutch national who allegedly headed the “Angels of Death” cartel, was jailed for ordering a string of assassinations and belonging to a criminal organisation. The public prosecutor’s office described Taghi’s operation as a “well-oiled killing machine”.\n\nA court in Amsterdam on Tuesday sentenced Taghi — who had been the Netherlands’ most wanted man — and two other defendants to life in prison in the sensational Marengo trial, which shocked the liberal nation. Taghi was not present at the reading of the verdict, which can be appealed.\n\nTaghi is also suspected of ordering three further murders during the trial, including of a top lawyer and a prominent journalist in the Netherlands, and pulling strings even from behind bars following his arrest in Dubai in 2019.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has become a hub for powerful European traffickers and Taghi was a key player in the flow of drugs through the port of Rotterdam, which has made the Netherlands one of the bloc’s biggest markets and a growing production hub for synthetic drugs.\n\nTaghi was extradited from Dubai in 2019, where key super cartel traffickers had lived opulent lifestyles believing themselves safe from capture.\n\nHis extradition paved the way for those of other top crime figures, including France’s convicted Moufide “Mouf” Bouchibi, known as “The Ghost”, and Raffaele Imperiale, an alleged Italian Camorra mafia boss who has turned state’s witness in Italy.\n\nEuropol in 2022 said it had smashed the heart of the super cartel’s command and logistics operations when it arrested 49 people in raids across Europe and in Dubai. Ireland’s Daniel Kinahan — considered by police and experts to be the biggest European drug boss still at large — is believed to be in hiding in the Gulf state, where he once partied with Taghi at the Irishman’s wedding in 2017.\n\nThe six-year trial put Taghi and 16 others in the dock — and the Netherlands’ reputation as a pivotal nexus in the European drug trade — firmly in the spotlight.\n\nThe trial began in 2018 with evidence from a suspected drug trafficker, identified by authorities as Nabil B, who became a crown witness in exchange for a reduced sentence of 10 years. Nabil’s lawyer and his brother were assassinated after he agreed to testify.\n\nAfter his extradition, prosecutors believe Taghi pulled strings from jail to order the murder of Dutch crime journalist Peter de Vries in 2021, who had reportedly been in touch with the crown witness.\n\nTwo men have been convicted of killing the lawyer, and a verdict in the De Vries case is expected in summer.\n\nProceedings in the Marengo trial were further thrown into disarray last year when Taghi’s defence lawyer Inez Weski was arrested on suspicion of belonging to Taghi’s criminal organisation. Weski was said to have passed on sensitive information from Taghi to outside contacts while he was in confinement. She has previously called the allegation incorrect and is awaiting trial.\n\nTaghi’s conviction comes as Irish prosecutors seek the extradition of Kinahan, who is under US sanctions and has a $5mn bounty on his head.\n\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions in Dublin has been reviewing a police file for several months on potential charges Kinahan could face. Dubai police visited Dublin in October last year to discuss co-operation, following a visit by Irish police to Dubai.\n\nEarlier this month, Irish police seized a haul of crystal meth worth an estimated €33mn, exposing alleged links between Kinahan’s group and Mexico’s notorious Sinaloa cartel.",

    "blurb": "Biz2Credit hopes to use Magnati’s data to broker loans to small businesses in the UAE",
    "date": "2024-02-2600:00:00.0",
    "body": "A New York fintech that has become a top source of US small business loans is partnering with a payments group backed by Brookfield to try to do the same thing in Abu Dhabi.\n\nBiz2Credit has struck a deal to feed Magnati’s real-time payments data into artificial intelligence models on its lending platform. That should enable it to broker up to $1bn in loans to small and medium sized enterprises in the next 18 months, and the same amount annually, according to Rohit Arora, co-founder and chief executive.\n\nCapital for the loans would come from overseas credit funds and local banks, Arora said. Payment services company Magnati was spun out of First Abu Dhabi Bank and is now majority owned by Canadian private equity giant Brookfield.\n\nBiz2Credit hopes to step into an underserved market and take advantage of the oil-rich emirate’s strong interest in fostering artificial intelligence and technology as a long-term alternative growth source.\n\nAbu Dhabi named an AI minister in 2017, the world’s first country to do so, has encouraged and funded AI research and invested heavily through its sovereign wealth funds.\n\n“The UAE and Saudi Arabia are some of the most progressive markets in their mindset right now,” Biz2Credit’s Arora said. He added that Abu Dhabi’s biggest AI group G42 is particularly keen to work with US players, after it cut ties with Chinese partners to assuage American concerns.\n\n“They’re very hungry for American technology because . . . G42 are realigning themselves away from China and more with the US.”\n\nBiz2Credit also has a separate partnership with the Saudi credit bureau Simah/Qarar and is also aiming to expand there.\n\nEmirati banks have traditionally shied away from lending to small businesses, according to Jorge Camarate, a Dubai-based partner at Strategy& who heads the consultancy’s financial services division in the Middle East.\n\nThat is partly because the banks have viewed the small enterprises as a risky bet. “The majority of SMEs are expat-owned and asset-light — import, export, trade, retail,” said Camarate. “It’s really difficult to lend to you because you can get on a plane and leave”.\n\nBut Magnati believes the data it collects on merchants will make banks more willing to lend to them. “We are going to the merchants and telling them: guys, you are sitting on this huge data and you haven’t done anything [with it],” said Ramana Kumar, Magnati’s chief executive.\n\nMagnati’s platform monitored transactions to businesses which use its payment services, Kumar said, and could compare their performance with other similar merchants to produce a picture of the company’s financial health.\n\n“We are giving new indicators based on this data,” Kumar said. “Now the propensity of someone to lend to them has increased”.\n\nBut Camarate was sceptical that an artificial intelligence lending solution would make a real difference to local banks’ appetite to lend to small businesses: “Honestly, you don’t need AI. You just need to go look at the turnover [the businesses have] been making”.\n\nFounded in 2007 by two Indian immigrants to the US, Biz2Credit started out lending to SMEs owned by other recent arrivals. It focused early on technology, eventually setting up an online platform that it now licenses to other banks as well as using it to originate loans.\n\nBut it really came into its own during the Covid pandemic when it processed more than $5.5bn in government-backed Paycheck Protection Program loans, and other banks using its software handed out more than $8bn more. However, Biz2Credit’s strong fraud detection methods have drawn inquiries from regulators concerned that it took longer than the 14 days it advertised for PPP loan processing.\n\nPPP “really showcased that we can build software at scale and we can use data to disperse a lot of money very quickly as well as prevent fraud”, Arora said. “Our mindset has now become, yes we can do a lot bigger things.”",

    "blurb": "Cash for Mediterranean development could unlock IMF deal for most populous Arab country, say analysts",
    "date": "2024-02-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Abu Dhabi has agreed to invest $35bn in a large development site on Egypt’s northwestern Mediterranean coast in a move that could ease a financial crisis in the country of around 110mn people.\n\nThe investment by state investment vehicle ADQ, which aims to build a tourism and financial centre in the Ras al-Hekma area, is central to unlocking a long-stalled agreement with the IMF for a loan package expected to top $10bn, analysts said.\n\nEgypt has been struggling with a severe foreign currency shortage for almost two years and the IMF has made its loan conditional on Cairo allowing the currency to move to a flexible exchange rate.\n\nHowever, authorities have been reluctant to allow market forces to set the value of the Egyptian pound because the central bank did not possess enough foreign exchange buffers to prevent a sharp fall against the dollar.\n\nThe official rate has been held at around E£31 to the dollar since March 2023, but it has been trading on the black market at more than twice that value.\n\n“This deal is the missing piece of the puzzle to bring the IMF agreement over the line,” said Mohamed Abu Basha, head of macroeconomic analysis at EFG-Hermes, a Cairo-based regional investment bank. “This will help resolve the immediate foreign exchange problem, and provide enough foreign currency liquidity to move towards a float.”\n\nEgypt has been forced to go to the IMF for multiple loans since 2016 and is its second biggest debtor after Argentina.\n\nThe country has spent billions on infrastructure projects overseen by the military over the past decade. Critics say that, while some of the projects address real needs, others — such as a new administrative capital — could have been deferred.\n\nMostafa Madbouly, the prime minister, announced the deal with ADQ to develop the 170 sq km coastal area on Friday.\n\nThe first tranche of investment, due in a week, will be a $15bn payment, including $5bn from a prior deposit by the United Arab Emirates in the Central Bank of Egypt.\n\nThe remaining funds will be invested within two months and will include $14bn of fresh money and $6bn from Emirati deposits in the central bank. These will be converted to Egyptian pounds and invested in the project.\n\nGoldman Sachs said in a note on Friday that the “magnitude of the investment is far greater than what we had been expecting and the timing far sooner”.\n\nIt added that, if the financing came through as planned, “we believe this (along with an upsized IMF programme) should provide ample liquidity to cover Egypt’s financing gap over the next four years”.\n\nGulf states have provided vital financial support to Egypt in recent years because they fear the economic collapse of such a large country would further destabilise the region.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar deposited $13bn in Egypt’s central bank after an exodus of foreign bond investors in a flight to safety.\n\nHowever, they have also become less willing to provide no-strings-attached handouts, instead seeking commercial investments and expecting reforms by governments they support. In Cairo’s case oil-rich states are considered crucial to its attempts to ease the currency crisis and meet commitments to the IMF to sell off state assets.\n\nADQ, chaired by the UAE’s national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, has been the main vehicle used by the Gulf state to acquire Egyptian assets.\n\nADQ said the project would establish Ras al-Hekma “as a leading first-of-its-kind Mediterranean holiday destination, financial centre and free zone equipped with world-class infrastructure to strengthen Egypt’s economic and tourism growth potential”.",

    "blurb": "Gulf state no longer subject to additional scrutiny by Paris-based Financial Action Task Force",
    "date": "2024-02-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The international body that oversees the fight against money laundering has removed the United Arab Emirates from its “grey list”, two years after it identified weaknesses in the Gulf state’s ability to tackle financial crime.\n\nThe Paris-based Financial Action Task Force said on Friday that the UAE was no longer subject to additional scrutiny by the body, having demonstrated that its ability to police illicit money flows had significantly improved.\n\nThe decision is a victory for the UAE, which has become an increasingly important global trading hub but has faced criticism over lax scrutiny of money flows, with transparency campaigners claiming the country has been used by criminals to hide international corruption.\n\n“If you are on the grey list you are seen to have crossed the red line,” said Bhavin Shah, a Dubai-based expert in combating financial crime and managing director of Secretariat Advisors. Getting off the list “restores the global business community’s trust in the UAE to have a robust framework to fight financial crimes”.\n\nBarbados, Gibraltar and Uganda were also removed from the grey list, while Kenya and Namibia were placed on it.\n\nFATF, which designs international standards to help governments tackle illicit financing for crimes ranging from terrorism to drugs trafficking, said the UAE and others removed from the grey list had taken “substantial steps” to improve their financial crime fighting systems.\n\nThe countries “have demonstrated the necessary political will to sustain and continue these changes”, said FATF president Raja Kumar.\n\nForeign affairs minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who chairs the UAE committee overseeing its counter money laundering and terrorism financing strategy, said the UAE “is committed to consolidate its unwavering approach and position within the world’s financial system” by sticking to “all relevant international laws and conventions”.\n\nFATF’s move will improve the reputation of a country that anti-corruption campaigners have painted as weak in enforcing anti-financial crime regulations and slow to help other countries investigate or extradite suspects living in the UAE. The Gulf state is dotted with free zones where people can open companies without revealing their identities.\n\nFor the UAE, being put on the grey list “was extremely challenging but it forced out a lot of reforms”, said Bryan Stirewalt, a former chief executive of banking regulator Dubai Financial Services Authority who now leads EY’s financial services regulation division in the region.\n\nBeing placed on the grey list means FATF believes a country has “strategic deficiencies” in their systems for combating money laundering, financing of terrorism and illegal arms deals — but that the state has agreed to work with the organisation to plug its gaps. Emerging markets from South Africa to Vietnam are on grey list, and getting off it, which means proving its anti financial crime processes are working properly, can take years of assessments and monitoring.\n\nBeing on the grey list does not impose restrictions on the country, but it acts as a red flag for international counterparties such as banks, often leading them to conduct heavier due diligence.\n\nMeasures taken by the UAE to get off the grey list have included bolstering its Executive Office of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terror Financing to crack down on illicit money, and beefing up legislation. The country also extradited several alleged financial criminals, introduced an online system for reporting suspicious activity and worked on improving a national registry of companies.\n\nThe UAE’s Financial Intelligence Unit pointed to increased compliance activity, including a 79 per cent rise in reporting of suspicious transactions and activity between 2021 and 2022, as proof that the state’s systems are strengthening.\n\nNicholas Cameron, KPMG’s head of forensics in the lower Gulf region, said the UAE had made “massive progress”, adding that “quite rigorous inspections” were now being carried out across financial institutions.\n\nHowever, anti-corruption campaigners argue that the FATF’s move has come too soon and that the international community should keep pressuring the UAE to continue its reforms.\n\nBerlin-headquartered Transparency International said in a letter to FATF that the UAE had more to prove, citing allegations that at least three Russian politicians hit with sanctions by Australia, New Zealand, France and Switzerland over Moscow’s war on Ukraine still owned properties in Dubai.\n\nAn influx of wealthy Russians to the UAE after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been a point of concern for western countries trying to use financial sanctions to starve the Kremlin’s war machine and prevent oligarchs from laundering money abroad.\n\nMaíra Martini, head of policy and advocacy at Transparency International, said two years was insufficient time to see the UAE’s changes in action. “It is definitely too early to tell whether there is an appetite to really go after those enabling corruption and those hiding in the UAE and those abusing the loopholes and secrecy,” Martini said.\n\nThe risk of criminals using the UAE to launder ill-gotten cash remains, experts say.\n\n“Getting out of the grey list is just one tiny step,” said Shah. “It’s more about the UAE continuing to have this position, to keep fighting emerging risks as a transient economy, as an important economic centre of the world.”",

    "date": "2024-02-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The Barclay family has pledged its remaining primary UK businesses as security to loans provided by IMI, the Abu Dhabi investment fund, as part of a deal to buy the Telegraph, according to filings.\n\nAt least half a dozen companies within the Barclay family empire — including the Very Group, an online retailer and financial services company — show new charges linked to the IMI loan agreement, filings at Companies House, the UK’s corporate registry, disclose. The charges have been entered against a range of holding companies related to the retail group.\n\nLloyds Banking Group pushed the Telegraph newspaper group into administration last year over unpaid debts by the Barclays of about £1.1bn, leaving the UK bank to conduct a sale of the right-leaning broadsheet that had been owned by the family since 2004.\n\nRedBird IMI, the vehicle backed by IMI, short-circuited this sales process by offering the family money to pay the Lloyds loan back in full. About half of this money was through a convertible loan for the national newspaper, and half in a loan of similar size to the family from IMI relating to other parts of the Barclay family business empire.\n\nDebt experts have questioned what collateral would be used to secure the IMI loan, with a complicated financing structure at the Very Group that includes securitised bonds, as well as a £200mn loan from Carlyle, the private equity group, that was used to pay off debt owed to Greensill Capital in 2021.\n\nOne person close to the process confirmed that the security charges were linked to the IMI loan, giving the Abu Dhabi investor the right to take control of parts of the family business in the event of a default. Parts of the group have also been used as collateral for the Carlyle loan. The family and RedBird IMI declined to comment.\n\nThe move comes as the Barclay family have scrambled to sell off assets to raise cash, including the Spectator magazine’s headquarters in Westminster, and Yodel, the parcel delivery group.\n\nThe family still technically own the Telegraph after repaying the Lloyds loan, although they cannot exert any influence over the company given the convertible loan agreement that has left RedBird IMI in effective control of the newspaper.\n\nThe Telegraph deal is being held up after a second regulatory investigation on public interest grounds by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority was launched by culture secretary Lucy Frazer.\n\nThe findings of these investigations are due about early March. Analysts now expect that Frazer will refer the deal to the CMA for a more in-depth probe, given the scale of public-interest concerns despite undertakings by RedBird IMI over editorial independence.\n\nThe deal has met with considerable opposition among members of the Conservative party.\n\n",

    "body": "Abu Dhabi artificial intelligence group G42 has sold its stakes in Chinese companies including TikTok owner ByteDance, as the group seeks to reassure US partners by cutting ties with China.\n\n42XFund, the $10bn technology investment arm of G42, told the Financial Times that it had “divested from all its investments in China”. The fund did not comment on individual deals or respond to questions about the overall size of its investment in China.\n\nHowever, two people with knowledge of the matter said the sell-off included shares in Beijing-based ByteDance. G42’s stake in the TikTok owner was worth an estimated $100mn, according to the data provider PitchBook.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, led by G42, is pressing to become a global leader in AI, an effort that has thrust it into the centre of geopolitical jostling between the US and China over the technology.\n\nChief executive Peng Xiao told the FT in December that G42 “cannot work with both sides” and was severing links with Chinese hardware suppliers, including Huawei.\n\n“In order for us to further our relationship — which we cherish — with our US partners, we simply cannot do much more with [previous] Chinese partners,” added Xiao, who was born in China, studied in the US and is now a UAE citizen.\n\nG42, which is chaired by the UAE’s powerful national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, is developing a range of AI projects, from health and life sciences to mapping and a large language model.\n\nBacked by investors including the UAE sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and US private equity firm Silver Lake, G42 had also been working with US partners such as Microsoft and OpenAI as well as Chinese technology companies.\n\nBut the Abu Dhabi-based group, which relies on semiconductors made by US chipmaker Nvidia, has scrambled to allay fears that companies linked to the Chinese government could gain access to American AI systems.\n\nIn December The New York Times reported that US officials were worried about the Emirati company’s relationship with groups including telecoms company Huawei. It said they were also concerned G42 could provide a route for the genetic data of US citizens to reach the Chinese government and companies.42XFund, which has said it operates as a private equity investor with $10bn to spend in sectors ranging from climate to consumer technology, has followed suit by divesting its Chinese holdings.\n\nLast March, it participated in a $300mn funding round for JD Industrials, part of online retailer JD.com group, led by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala.\n\nByteDance declined to comment.

    "blurb": "Entrepreneurs operating in Gulf state hope their delicate commercial links can withstand the conflict",
    "date": "2024-02-0700:00:00.0",
    "body": "In the days after Hamas’s October 7 attack and the war that followed, Israeli entrepreneur Ron Daniel left Dubai, his home since 2021, fearing that he was “sitting on a volcano”.\n\nThe chief executive of asset manager and financial technology company Liquidity Group flew back to the United Arab Emirates a month later after deciding these concerns were “mainly in my head”.\n\nDaniel is among a small band of Israelis who have been living and working in the UAE since it normalised relations with Israel four years ago. His decision to return reflects hopes among Israeli businesspeople that the US-brokered normalisation with the UAE and three other Arab states — which allows them to openly seek deals in the Middle East — can withstand the fury and anguish created by Israel’s war in Gaza.\n\n“The peace survived, the interest survived, the friendships survived,” said Daniel, adding that while it was “awkward” with Emirati friends at the start, “very quickly it was like, ‘it’s got nothing to do with us’.”\n\nThe UAE, like all other Arab states, has condemned the devastation wrought by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which has enraged Emiratis and a large part of the majority expatriate population.\n\nBut anger and hurt have largely been contained to private conversations in the autocratic state, where protests are prohibited. This has led to an absence of the kind of large-scale demonstrations in support of the Palestinians seen across the region and other parts of the world. The authorities have also warned against overt displays of Palestinian solidarity.\n\nThe UAE’s leaders have stated their commitment to the deal with Israel known as the Abraham Accords, despite their concerns about Israel’s Gaza offensive.\n\n“The UAE has taken a strategic decision, and strategic decisions are long-term,” presidential foreign affairs adviser Anwar Gargash told a conference in Dubai last month.\n\nThe UAE has long been unhappy with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government. But it considers its decision to become the third Arab state to normalise ties with Israel as vital to its interests, both in terms of security and its economic ambitions.\n\nThe UAE needed to keep “communication, intelligence and diplomacy” channels open and see if it “can put them to use”, said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati analyst. “We knew there would be ups and downs.”\n\nUnlike the “cold peace” that Egypt and Jordan agreed with Israel, the UAE — which never fought a war with the Jewish state — embraced the relationship and pushed for greater economic ties, with a particular desire to tap Israeli technology. And with the UAE and Israel sharing a foe in Iran, the accord also enabled Abu Dhabi to overtly develop intelligence sharing and security co-operation.\n\nMost of the new business that followed the accord was conducted with Emirati state-affiliated entities, particularly those in Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich capital that drove the normalisation deal.\n\nEven before the war, tapping private UAE family offices was harder than expected for Israeli entrepreneurs, who wanted to use the Abraham Accords to gain a regional foothold and access to deep-pocketed Gulf investors.\n\nThere was an idea that “Israeli entrepreneurs would come over, raise a lot of capital and come back”, said Elie Wurtman, co-founder of Jerusalem-based PICO Venture Partners. But “that is not the way business gets done there”.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has now chilled nascent prospects of Emirati private businesses doing deals with Israeli companies because of the simmering fury among merchant families — many of whom were already wary of dealing with Israelis — over the destruction in Gaza.\n\n“Whether it’s business or socially, everyone who is here will think twice,” said an Emirati executive. “If I had business with an Israel company, I would stop that right now,” he added. “Emotions are very high.”\n\nThe most significant deals have involved Abu Dhabi’s state-affiliated companies. G42, Abu Dhabi’s artificial intelligence company chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE’s powerful national security adviser, was the first Emirati business to open an office in Israel. Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala has invested $1bn in an Israeli gasfield and $100mn in Israeli venture capital and start-ups.\n\nAnd even if some business may have slowed, there are signs that in other areas it is moving ahead.\n\nIsrael-based senior researcher Yoelle Maarek said last month that she was moving ahead with opening a Haifa branch of Abu Dhabi’s Technology Innovation Institute, renowned for its open-source large language model Falcon. TII said it had established itself in Israel early last year, and that Maarek “was in a recruitment process with us since late summer of 2023” — prior to the start of the war — and has now been “onboarded”.\n\nThe Gulf state’s airlines have continued services to Tel Aviv even as other carriers cancelled flights, underscoring the interest in maintaining the relationship with Israel.\n\nFor many Israelis doing business in the Emirates, the Israel-Hamas war has sharpened the need for friends in a hostile region.\n\n“Since October 7, perhaps the Abrahamic Accords is no longer in its honeymoon phase — but it’s still our future,” said Noa Gastfreund, co-founder of the Israeli-Emirati business forum UAE-IL Tech zone. The group is being rebranded as simply Tech Zone “in light of the sensitivities and need for wider regional collaborations”.\n\nArik Shtilman, chief executive officer of the Israeli-founded financial technology company Rapyd, which has about 100 employees in the UAE, said the war’s impact on his business was “literally nonexistent”.\n\n“Everything is business as usual” in the UAE, he said, adding that there has been a greater change in Europe where it has become more challenging to sign on new clients.\n\nThe bilateral flow of goods between Israel and the UAE, excluding software, topped $2bn from January to August 2023, according to Israel’s ambassador in Abu Dhabi. A UAE-Israel partnership deal came into force last year, lowering tariffs and aiming to boost bilateral trade to $10bn within five years.\n\nWurtman of PICO Venture Partners said a crucial aspect was that Israelis still felt welcomed in the Gulf state. “It’s one of the safest places in the world today to be Israeli,” he said.",

    "blurb": "UK culture secretary asks regulators whether holding company represents a different deal",
    "date": "2024-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Abu Dhabi-backed RedBird IMI faces further regulatory scrutiny of its £600mn planned takeover of the Telegraph Media Group following UK government concerns about a proposal to overhaul its corporate structure for the business.\n\nRedBird IMI wants to create a holding company via a new English limited partnership to acquire the newspaper group, as part of a package of proposals designed to guarantee the independence of the editorial team of the right-leaning broadsheet.\n\nLucy Frazer, culture secretary, on Thursday asked Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority to consider whether the new holding company in effect represented a materially different deal, and so needed a new probe from both regulators.\n\nRedBird IMI’s bid was already being scrutinised by Ofcom, which was due to present its recommendations to Frazer this week. She had asked the regulator to report on whether the deal could raise public interest concerns in relation to the need for accurate presentation of news and the need for free expression of opinion, given the risk of influence by Abu Dhabi over the newspaper.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes said that it would report “imminently”. The new government intervention could extend the process by a further few weeks.\n\nThe proposal for the new UK company was not intended to change the identity, nature or economic interests of the ultimate shareholders at RedBird IMI, the government said, citing the investment vehicle. International Media Investments, an Abu Dhabi vehicle controlled by the Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, owns about three-quarters of RedBird IMI.\n\nA spokesperson for RedBird IMI said: “This change was made in order to clarify the point that IMI is a passive investor in the company that will own the Telegraph and as such will have no management or editorial involvement whatsoever in the title.”\n\nIn a written statement, Frazer said that given the “very late stage in the process at which information about this new corporate structure has been shared and implemented . . . I do not consider this is conducive to the full and proper functioning of the process”.\n\nRedBird IMI managed to short-circuit an auction process of the newspaper group last year by agreeing to repay the debts of the original owners, the Barclay family, which had prompted the Lloyds Banking Group to seize control of the assets.\n\nThe deal has sparked considerable opposition from Conservative MPs — with the Telegraph traditionally seen as closest to the policies of the party — as well as from rival newspaper groups that have previously signalled their interest in buying the title.\n\nMembers of the editorial team at both the Telegraph and the group’s Spectator magazine have also flagged concerns over the record of press freedom in Abu Dhabi, and worries over editorial independence from part-ownership of a foreign government.\n\nRedBird IMI, which is run by former CNN boss Jeff Zucker, has promised to create an editorial charter overseen by independent media executives in a legally binding governance structure. Other legal undertakings to the government have promised to guarantee IMI’s status as a passive investor, with no role in operational or editorial matters.\n\nIn a separate letter to RedBird IMI, the government said it remained “concerned about the potential influence of International Media Investments over TMG which could affect the free expression of opinion and accurate presentation of news in the newspapers”.\n\nThe letter continued that there were “certain reserved matters where IMI consent will still be required under the partnership agreement”.\n\nAnalysts predict that Frazer will probably refer the deal to the CMA for a more in-depth probe, owing to concerns over press freedom from the takeover of a national newspaper by an investment group backed by Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe move would be a politically safe option, according to people close to the transaction, given it would delay a concrete decision for some months and provide extra evidence for a move either to rubber-stamp the deal or block it on public interest grounds.\n\n\n\n",

    "blurb": "Leaked UN report outlined ‘credible’ evidence that the Gulf state was delivered arms and fuelling the conflict",
    "date": "2024-01-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has denied arming the paramilitary group fighting a war with Sudan’s armed forces, after a leaked UN document found “credible” evidence that it was sending weapons to the Rapid Support Forces.\n\nThe report, compiled by experts for the UN Security Council and seen by the Financial Times but not yet made public, said several shipments of weapons and ammunition shipments were unloaded each week from cargo planes at an airport in Chad, and handed to the RSF at the Sudanese border.\n\nBut the UAE strongly denied arming any group in Sudan, telling the UN panel that these flights carried humanitarian aid, including for a hospital it had set up.\n\nThe Gulf state “does not take sides in the current conflict”, a UAE official told the FT, adding that the country had “consistently called for de-escalation, a sustainable ceasefire and the initiation of diplomatic dialogue” in Sudan.\n\nDespite the UAE denial, some analysts believe its alleged backing has been crucial in strengthening the RSF. “If the UAE withdraws its support and cuts ties with the RSF today there’s an 80 per cent chance the war might end tomorrow,” said Hamid Khalafallah, a Sudan expert and PhD researcher at the UK’s University of Manchester.\n\nThe RSF, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemeti, have been fighting the Sudanese armed forces for control of the country since April. Government forces are led by the country’s de facto president and army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.\n\nThe fighting has killed more than 13,000 people, forced about 7.6mn to flee and left almost 25mn — more than half of the country’s population — needing humanitarian aid, according to the UN’s humanitarian affairs agency.\n\nHemeti’s militia now controls most of the western Sudanese Darfur region, its historic power base, and parts of the capital Khartoum. Last month it seized control of the country’s second-largest city, Wad Madani, which had been the centre of humanitarian relief efforts.\n\nThe UN report alleged that the RSF — which grew out of the Arab militia Janjaweed — and its allies had, since the conflict broke out, committed atrocities in Darfur that amounted to war crimes and could amount to crimes against humanity. The Sudanese armed forces also committed war crimes, it added, for instance by using aerial bombing and heavy shelling in urban areas.\n\nHemeti’s militia exploited the country’s natural resources to fund the war, according to the UN report. It said the paramilitary group invested proceeds from Sudan’s gold trade — most of which it controlled prior to the war — into several industries, which enabled it to “acquire weapons, pay salaries, fund media campaigns, lobbying, and buy support of other political and armed groups”.\n\nSix of the entities that the RSF and SAF have allegedly used to maintain their war efforts had sanctions imposed this week by the EU. Two of the companies linked to the RSF had UAE addresses, and the EU alleged that one — Al Junaid Multi Activities Co Ltd — acted as a conduit for arms from the UAE.\n\n“The RSF is also using Al Junaid’s gold production and exports to secure military support from the UAE, to which most of Sudan’s gold production is smuggled,” the EU regulation stated. The FT could not reach Al Junaid for comment.\n\nThe conflict has drawn in several other countries vying for influence in strategically placed Sudan, which borders the Red Sea and straddles the Middle East and Africa.\n\nAside from the UAE, which over the past decade has expanded its influence in the Horn of Africa region and is an ally of Ethiopia, Egypt has supported Sudan’s military, albeit in a minor capacity, analysts say, while Saudi Arabia maintains relations with both warring parties and hosted peace talks in Jeddah.\n\nHowever, various peace talks that have also involved the US have failed to curb the violence, with analysts saying they lacked co-ordination and a clear strategy as well as the backing of several important players.\n\nWith no sign of the fighting abating, there are fears the Sudan war will drag on. As the conflict fragments, there is a risk of new groups forming and a splintering into localised fighting, which could increase the suffering of civilians and make peace talks more difficult.\n\nThis was what happened in the past, Khalafallah said, noting how the RSF was a “militia that the military created, empowered and supported, and now it is fighting against the military”.",

It will be listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange on January 26.\n\nIt will be managed by Lunate, with BNY Mellon serving as its global custodian.\n\nThe ETF will be listed some two months after CSOP Asset Management unveiled the CSOP Saudi Arabia ETF in Hong Kong as the first ETF with single-country exposure to the Saudi market listed in Asia Pacific.\n\nLunate in May had also launched the Chimera S&P China HK Shariah ETF, a shariah-compliant ETF tracking Hong Kong-listed Chinese equities.

    "date": "2024-01-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "People with a liking for white furniture. Children in designer wear. Social media hotel-gym reviewers called things like Brianna. People who eat at Nobu on a non-ironic basis. Paulo Coelho readers.\n\nThere is a prejudice about the crowd that Dubai attracts. I won’t pretend, during a trip here this week, not to have seen them at all. But the visit has been a better education in global affairs than was available in Davos over the same time.\n\nA landlocked town in a landlocked nation is a damn fool place to host the World Economic Forum. As the Houthis are giving us occasion to remember, the forum of world economics is the sea. The setting of Davos encourages a very turn-of-the-millennium obsession with ideas, “trends” and tech over geographic facts. You wouldn’t know from the abstraction of the discourse there how much of modern life still hinges on the safe passage of tangible objects across water (or on the distribution of mineral deposits). It is easier in Dubai to see what makes the world go round because of, not despite, its de-intellectualisation of things.\n\nBut that’s the least of it. When the world was American-led, market-based and ever more democratic, Davos was a useful distillation of it. Dubai, where the US is one influence among several, capital more state-directed and political values negotiable, is now a more faithful portrait of the world. When a sanctioned Russian moves from Knightsbridge to Palm Jumeirah, or a sovereign fund rather than a private one acquires a foreign asset, globalisation is going on — just not on western terms.\n\nI doubt there will be a “capital of the world” again. Power is too diffused. But the trend of the world is best seen in Dubai. (Bangkok is a decent vantage point too.) You can’t guess from the faces and voices of shoppers in Dubai Mall which have been the best-off nations since 1945, or even if Europe is better-off than India. Excluding the airport, I have overheard one American all week. (“This place is crazy”, she said of the Mall, twice over, and not without insight.) If Davos Man and Woman were rich people from rich countries, their Dubai equivalents are rich people from middle-income countries that were poor within their parents’ lifetimes.\n\nTo be clear, I preferred the Davos world. I am becoming more, not less, of an Anglo-liberal absolutist with age. But if the point is to have some notion of where things are going, then passing through Dubai once in a while, as a sort of pulse-check, is shrewd. The alternative? The untenable conceit that a globalist is someone who knows London and Paris.\n\nThis year is the 100th anniversary of Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain. Set in a Davos sanatorium, the book re-creates the world before the first world war on a miniature scale. One patient represents liberal humanism, one conservative reaction, another decadence, and so on. In the final scene, when the protagonist comes down from the mountain to fight, the reader knows that an inferno is due for that entire civilisation.\n\nA century on, Davos is again infused with a sense of chronic or even terminal illness. A once-invincible order seems to be going to seed. Dubai is worth a visit because it reveals this fear to be at least half-right. Yes, the economic centre of the world (people have tried to calculate its exact location over time) is moving east. The fruits of that new wealth have to be seen up close.\n\nAt the same time, look how much still rests on western elements. There is the US naval presence up in Bahrain. There is the common law in the Dubai International Finance Centre. What price Jebel Ali Port if America were to leave the guarding of shipping lanes to its less liberal rivals? Which foreign investors would trust the enforcement of their contracts to whimsical diktat rather than case precedent?\n\nThere is a lot of glee out there at the fading of Davos World. That doesn’t mean there is a model to replace it. The cleverness of Dubai is in not choosing. This mental bifurcation extends to the tolerant-but-also-strict moral codes, the western-but-also-not architecture, and the ambiguous geopolitical orientation of the United Arab Emirates. I can never decide if this is the least subtle place on Earth, or the most.\n\njanan.ganesh@ft.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow @FTWeekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life & Art wherever you listen",

    "blurb": "Urban areas must rapidly become more resilient to rising temperatures",
    "date": "2024-01-1800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Think of climate change, and the mind instantly tends to go to melting ice caps, arid plains, forest fires and sinking tropical islands. But the impact of rising temperatures will not only be felt in the hinterlands. A report, commissioned by London’s mayor, this week highlighted the possibility of “more intense and frequent heatwaves, more intense rainfall, flash flooding and sea level rise” in the British capital. It is a reminder that cities across the world — where over 80 per cent of global gross domestic product and the majority of the planet’s population live — are also under significant threat.\n\nMajor urban ports — including those on America’s eastern and western coastlines — risk becoming increasingly swamped in the coming decades. The 2050 Climate Change City Index, produced by Nestpick, a rentals platform, places a range of high and low-income cities at risk of rising sea-level damage. This includes Bangkok in top place, where the OECD has projected over 5mn of its inhabitants could be exposed to flooding by the 2070s. Amsterdam, Shenzhen and Dubai also rank in the top 10.\n\nIt is not only coastal cities that face challenges. Many riverside cities including Paris, Cairo and New Delhi are at risk of flooding too, while those farther from flowing water are under threat from drought, such as Phoenix, Brasília and Mexico City. The number of cities exposed to extreme heat is expected to almost triple by 2030. Extreme weather events are also expected to become more intense and frequent.\n\nThe human and economic costs could be enormous. In young and fast-growing African and Asian countries, urbanisation is set to continue unabated. This will put millions more impoverished city dwellers directly at risk of flooding, heat illnesses and famine. The urban heat island effect — where cities tend to be hotter than rural areas due to heat trapping and emissions from buildings — could also be exacerbated as populations and economic activity swells. Trading floors, skyscrapers and factories in urban centres risk becoming uninhabitable. According to C40, a network of city mayors, climate-related flooding and drought could cost the world’s major cities $194bn annually.\n\nWith the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5C or to well below 2C potentially slipping out of reach, cities need to make a step-change in their adaptation and resilience efforts. Some are already acting. At the extreme end, the Indonesian government plans to abandon its capital, Jakarta, 40 per cent of which now lies below sea level, for a new capital city over 1,000km away. Others have begun by greening cities with parks and gardens, which help to cool urban space and reduce flood risk.\n\nBut too many cities are taking inadequate action. The report on London stated the capital was “underprepared” for the effects of climate change. Greening and retrofitting often aged infrastructure in dense urban spaces is complicated, disruptive and expensive. To navigate this, more cities must first create adaptation strategies. Planning rules may need reform and local areas will also need the powers and resources to adapt their cities. Investment in flood defences, land engineering solutions and green technology also needs to be ramped up. Regional and multilateral lenders can provide financial support for cities in developing countries.\n\nThere are political challenges too. Boosting cities’ resilience could be seen as shifting funds from needy regions to wealthier urbanites. Big populations in urban areas may also vote down necessary, but ugly, infrastructure adaptations. It is essential nonetheless that national and local governments find a way through the myriad difficulties. Otherwise their urban economic powerhouses will come under increasing strain, multiplying their problems in the process.",

    "date": "2024-01-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "An executive from consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal was detained in the United Arab Emirates while working to overhaul a Nasdaq-listed company that US authorities charged with fraud last month, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nGuy Wall, the managing director of A&M’s restructuring practice in Dubai, last month became a director of Brooge Energy Limited, a UAE oil storage company that had been plagued by financial reporting failings since listing in New York in 2019.\n\nWall and a colleague became directors after A&M was appointed in November by a Cayman Islands court to oversee the liquidation of BPGIC Holdings, the holding company that is the majority owner of Brooge.\n\nThe court appointed A&M as liquidators following a successful legal claim over unpaid debts from Bahrain-based investment firm Asma Capital.\n\nWall was detained this month by authorities in the UAE, the people said, as he was in the process of working out a plan to stabilise Brooge after the fraud charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThey added that Wall was held in prison in Fujairah, the emirate where Brooge’s oil storage tankers are based, before being released. Wall was detained for allegedly trying to remove documents from Brooge’s Fujairah offices without authorisation, the people added.\n\nA&M, which has its headquarters in New York, declined to comment. Wall did not respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Brooge declined to provide a comment for publication.\n\nA representative of the Fujairah police said that they “cannot share personal information about people who are detained in our prison”. The UAE government did not provide a comment by the time of publication.\n\nBrooge was part of a wave of companies that capitalised on investors’ appetite for special acquisition companies and was valued at more than $1bn when it went public.\n\nThe company had the backing of Middle East investors including Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the son of the previous UAE president, who died in 2022.\n\nThe sheikh held a minority stake in Brooge through his 24 per cent stake in BPGIC Holdings. A businessman, Salman Dawood Salman al-Ameri, was the majority shareholder in BPGIC Holdings.\n\nTheir stakes were set in effect to be stripped from them, however, when Wall and fellow A&M executive Alexander Lawson were appointed as liquidators of BPGIC Holdings.\n\nA&M has significantly expanded its international operations in recent years, including in the Middle East, competing with global advisory firms such as the Big Four professional services groups. It employs about 8,500 people globally.\n\nThe SEC on December 22 charged Brooge and two of its former executives with fraud after it found that the company had “created false invoices to support inflating revenues from its oil facilities in Fujairah, UAE by over $70mn over three years”.\n\nBrooge, which did not admit or deny the SEC’s charges, agreed to pay a $5mn penalty.\n\nThe regulator’s probe focused on a related party called Al Brooge International Advisory (BIA), which it said “had no meaningful business operations aside from participating in the misstatements of revenues associated with [Brooge Energy]”.\n\nBoth EY and PwC have resigned as auditors of Brooge since the company went public. PwC quit in December 2022, citing “disagreements” on matters of accounting with the company.\n\nBrooge replaced PwC with UAE-based accountancy firm Affiniax AAS Auditors. Last year, Affiniax AAS reclassified $74mn of funds received from BIA between 2018 and 2020 that had previously been booked as revenue as a liability. This meant that the accounts showed that Brooge owed this money to BIA.\n\nFive days after the SEC announced its charges, Brooge said that its main subsidiary had been “served with a court order from a court in the UAE following a case brought forward by Brooge International Advisory”. It added that its legal counsel had determined that it should not impact Brooge’s “ongoing operations”.\n\nBIA did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "body": "A Saudi Arabia-backed investment fund is liquidating the holding company of a United Arab Emirates oil storage company that has been plagued by financial reporting issues since going public in New York.\n\nBrooge Energy Limited listed its shares on Nasdaq in 2019 through a merger with a special acquisition company that gave it a market valuation of more than $1bn.\n\nThe operator of oil storage facilities in the emirate of Fujairah had the backing of powerful Middle East investors including Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the son of the previous president of the UAE, and claimed in its prospectus to have signed big contracts with unnamed international trading companies.\n\nBut Brooge subsequently had two Big Four auditors resign, restated tens of millions of dollars of improperly booked revenue from a related party and became subject to an examination of its financial statements from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nLast month, an investment fund managed by Bahrain’s Asma Capital placed Brooge’s majority shareholder BPGIC Holdings into liquidation over unpaid debts. Asma is backed by Gulf sovereign entities such as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, the Islamic Development Bank and Bahrain’s finance ministry.\n\nBPGIC Holdings borrowed $75mn from Asma’s fund in 2019, but never paid any interest on the debt, according to Cayman Island court filings related to its insolvency, racking up more than $30mn of unpaid interest.\n\nBPGIC Holdings owns more than 85 per cent of Brooge Energy’s listed shares. The holding company was in turn owned by Salman Dawood Salman al-Ameri and Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\nBrooge was part of a wave of foreign groups that seized on the US boom for special acquisition companies to list their shares in New York.\n\nBrooge last week announced that two restructuring advisers from Alvarez & Marsal had been appointed to its board as a result of BPGIC Holdings being placed into liquidation. Alexander Lawson and Guy Wall, the Alvarez & Marsal partners acting as official liquidators, said that the process would “have no adverse impact on the company’s performance” and that Brooge has a “solid business foundation and state-of-the-art facilities”.\n\nBrooge declined to comment. Asma Capital did not respond to requests for comment. A lawyer who represented BPGIC Holdings did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhen Brooge listed its shares, it disclosed that its auditor EY had identified “material weaknesses” in the company’s “internal control over financial reporting”. Brooge also disclosed that it relied on an entity called Al Brooge International Advisory (BIA) for the entirety of its revenue. While BIA had been a related party, Brooge said that one of its shareholders was planning to divest her stake in the company, making it independent.\n\nEY resigned as Brooge’s auditor in 2020 and was replaced by PwC. Brooge’s audit committee then began an internal probe into the company’s accounting practices in 2022, in response to an SEC “examination” of its financial statements. In August 2022, Brooge announced that its audit committee concluded that its financial statements “should no longer be relied upon” due to “revenue recognition” issues.\n\nIn December 2022, PwC resigned as Brooge’s auditor after “disagreements” on matters of accounting. In a letter to the SEC written in January 2023, PwC stated that “likely illegal acts” had come to its attention that would “have a material effect on the financial statements”. Brooge said at the time that it “strongly disagrees with PwC’s opinions” stated in the letter.\n\nBrooge appointed UAE based accountancy firm Affiniax AAS Auditors to replace PwC and “reaudit” its previously issued financial statements. As a result, Brooge reclassified $74mn of funds received from BIA between 2018 and 2020 that had previously been booked as revenue as a liability. Brooge now also considers BIA a related party.\n\n",

    "body": "The number of core participants at the UN COP28 flagship climate summit in Dubai topped 65,000, as an unprecedented number of observers and guests including business executives joined country delegations for the first time.\n\nThis compares with the 36,000-plus tally of the core participants at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the year before, or an increase of 80 per cent.\n\nBy contrast, when the groundbreaking Paris agreement was agreed in 2015 about 26,000 people attended. The first climate COP was held in Berlin in 1995 with just under 4,000 delegates.\n\nThe FT analysis of the COP 28 figures, collated by the UN on the closing day of the summit held at Expo City, includes only those who had activated their badges for the so-called blue zone where the formal business is conducted.\n\nThe 65,000-plus number of core participants does not include technical and support staff of almost 13,500, which would bring the physical presence to near 80,000 on site.\n\nEarly registrations closed at the end of October and initial figures of more than 100,000 were recorded, but about one-third of those indicating their interest did not ultimately attend.\n\nThe largest group of delegates plus observers are those who have an active part in the negotiations and represent nation states, and the EU bloc. This group numbered more than 40,000, or almost double the previous figures, including more than 22,000 “overflow” badges issued.\n\nThe UAE presidency hosting the summit invited more than 9,000 to the formal business area in the blue zone, including about 5,000 guests outside of its own extended delegation, based on Financial Times analysis of a provisional UN list of attendees.\n\nThe UAE guest list included chief executives and private sector lobbyists, led by energy industry executives, such as ExxonMobil boss Darren Woods, Oxy CEO Vicki Hollub, ENI head Claudio Descalzi and German energy group RWE’s chief, Markus Krebber.\n\nThe UAE also brought a sizeable contingent of 17 Abu Dhabi National Oil Company staff, where COP28 president Sultan al-Jaber is chief executive. Its national renewable energy group Masdar also had more than 70 staff on hand.\n\nAside from energy executives, bankers and finance executives were one of the most represented professions among badge holders invited by the UAE.\n\nDespite the numbers attending the event was judged by most as a logistical success, with the vast venue allowing for the crowd, and issues encountered in Sharm el-Sheikh at COP27 over a lack of food and water were avoided with wide choices and outlets available at Expo City in Dubai.\n\nThe UAE and country delegations and their guests were provided special access to areas that offered a plentiful free buffet. A hierarchy of badges involved a colour system, with a strip of pink, orange and blue indicating a higher level of access, while media were designated yellow.\n\nEven on the busiest days, when world leaders and their security detail might have jostled with other delegates as they did in Sharm el-Sheikh, the crowds were dwarfed by the 14m height air-conditioned indoor venues.\n\nPalm trees, landscaped gardens and overhead canopies helped cool walkways at the site built in the desert outside Dubai to host a trade fair in 2020. Traffic wardens separated the flow of pedestrians from the most important guests, who were ferried around in buggies.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron was observed being instructed how to drive one, and 80-year-old US top climate official John Kerry was taken to and from late night meetings with the UAE presidency in a buggy.\n\nCOP29 is due to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, after the eastern European group of countries took its turn to elect the choice of host country. The selection overcame blocking action by Russia, which vetoed other EU countries as a result of tensions related to the war in Ukraine.\n\nAt a meeting to launch the COP29 effort on Friday, Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said the petrostate would “assert itself in this field as an oil and gas country, and everyone in the world will see again that our agenda is related to green energy.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Aime Williams",

    "date": "2023-12-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Every UN climate COP ends with a mix of relief, exhaustion and bafflement. The two-week COP28 conference in Dubai was no exception.\n\nIt ran nearly 24 hours over schedule and headlines centred on 34 agonisingly crafted words in the final text that called on countries to shift away from fossil fuels in energy systems.\n\nMarkets do not move and change does not magically happen with such words, even though these were the first of their kind in nearly 30 years of COPs. The power of these meetings lies instead in their ability to normalise the once unthinkable, which is why exhausted delegates haggle so fiercely over a final outcome.\n\nBut COPs are changing too. Behind the fraught diplomatic negotiations, countries and companies have begun to forge less visible agreements to take more immediate and concrete climate action that could cut demand for fossil fuels and eliminate potent emissions.\n\nThree pledges made at COP28 are worth looking at in detail.\n\nWhile oil and gas companies have not yet committed to producing less fossil fuels, their pledge to cut emissions from their own operations is noteworthy.\n\nSaudi Aramco, ExxonMobil and BP were among 50 of the world’s top fossil fuel producers to sign the “oil and gas decarbonisation charter”, a voluntary agreement to stop routine flaring of excess gas by 2030 and eliminate almost all leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.\n\nMost of the initial signatories were national oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco and Brazil’s Petrobras, which account for more than half of global production but typically face less pressure to decarbonise than their publicly traded counterparts.\n\nThe one thing they all have in common is methane, the odourless gas produced by virtually every oil and gas project worldwide. When it is not cost effective to capture it, companies often release methane into the atmosphere via venting or burn it through flaring, which converts it into carbon dioxide.\n\nThe gas also leaks into the atmosphere from facilities via innumerable small, undetected or unreported leaks in pipelines or other equipment, or through large-scale releases called “super-emitter” events.\n\nScientists say methane has been responsible for up to 30 per cent of global warming since the industrial era began, so the Dubai charter offers a win for the climate, even if the 50 signatories account for less than a third of the industry’s total operational emissions.\n\nSo can the charter’s aims be met? “It’ll be different for different companies,” says Adam Pollard of the Wood Mackenzie research firm.\n\nSome of the biggest oil companies have already promised zero routine flaring and near-zero methane, he says, and a number have shown that big progress can be made on the latter. “With ongoing monitoring, detection and mitigation, near-zero methane feels quite achievable,” he says.\n\nBut zero routine flaring may be trickier. In an ideal world, excess gas would be piped off and sold for extra revenue. But that can be hard in offshore sites, where most flaring happens, because it’s costly to build the necessary gas export facilities.\n\nCompanies will have to assess the future of these sites, says Atul Arya, chief energy strategist at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “They may decide that they have to shut some production because that’s the most cost effective answer to flaring.”\n\nGovernment regulation will also dictate the charter’s success. Tough new US and EU methane regulations should ensure that companies operating in these jurisdictions live up to their charter pledges, says Kevin Book, managing director of Clearview Energy Partners, a Washington consultancy.\n\nBut for companies operating elsewhere, it will depend on their willingness to invest in the equipment needed to detect and quantify leaks, and monitoring by outside agencies.\n\nAny company trying to dodge its methane pledges faces censure, thanks to more widely available satellite detection.\n\nNew tracing and tracking technologies are making it much easier for the UN and NGOs to pinpoint methane leaks and carbon dioxide footprints around the clock. “So you can run but you can’t hide,” US climate envoy, John Kerry, told reporters in Dubai on Wednesday. “People are going to be held accountable for what their footprints are and what the progress is.”\n\nA second COP28 commitment could affect demand for fossil fuels by tripling the world’s renewable energy generation capacity to at least 11,000 gigawatts by 2030.\n\nMore than 120 countries signed up to this pledge, which will require a big leap in effort from what has been done before. It took 12 years from 2010 to 2022 to achieve the last tripling of renewable capacity. This one has to be done in the space of eight.\n\nMeeting the goal will be “hard, but achievable,” according to analysts at the BloombergNEF research group who have assessed the commitment.\n\nThe good news is that solar and wind are now the cheapest sources of new energy generation in most countries, according to the BloombergNEF, and direct subsidies are no longer the main ingredient needed to accelerate deployment in many places.\n\nThe less good news is that the growth of renewables is being held back by a range of bottlenecks that many authorities are struggling to unblock.\n\nTwo chief culprits: permitting rules that can hold up projects for years, and a lack of the investment needed to allow power grids built for fossil fuels to absorb renewables.\n\nOnly 50 cents is currently spent on transmission and distribution grids globally for every dollar of renewable energy investment, say the BloombergNEF analysts.\n\nAs a result, it can take up to eight years to get a grid connection permit in Europe, meaning a wind farm project proposed in 2023 would not be hooked up in time to meet the COP28 target.\n\nIt is estimated nearly 600GW of renewables were queueing for connection in five European countries at the end of 2022 — enough to double the region’s capacity.\n\nThe problem is also bad in the US where, despite generous clean energy support in the Inflation Reduction Act, projects that might triple the country’s renewable capacity by 2030 are snarled up in grid queues.\n\nOne country that is expected to reach the 2030 tripling goal is China, already a wind and solar juggernaut, where billions have been invested in ultra high voltage power lines. But that will not be enough on its own.\n\n“I’m more worried about what happens in the rest of the world,” says Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission coalition of experts.\n\nThe US government is trying to fix the problem by fast-tracking permits for transmission lines, as are countries elsewhere. But BloombergNEF forecasts suggest that as things stand today, the US, Europe, Japan, India and Indonesia are not on track to meet the 2030 tripling target.\n\nThe third COP28 commitment with implications for hydrocarbons is aimed at boosting energy efficiency.\n\nMore efficient and smart use of energy is widely referred to as the “first fuel” in clean energy transitions because it offers some of the quickest and most cost-effective options for cutting emissions, lowering energy bills and bolstering energy security.\n\nThe technology and policies required are already well established, from heat pumps and greener lightbulbs to low-carbon building codes and transport.\n\nElectric cars also matter: these vehicles can convert more than 77 per cent of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels while conventional gasoline vehicles only convert about 12 per cent to 30 per cent of the energy stored in gasoline.\n\nThe countries that signed up to the 2030 renewables pledge agreed to collectively double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements from around 2 per cent to more than 4 per cent every year until 2030.\n\nCan this be done? “It’s highly ambitious, but achievable,” says James Newcomb, a senior expert at the Rocky Mountain Institute research group that was founded to improve US energy practices.\n\nThe soaring price of energy spurred by the war in Ukraine has seen record global investment in energy efficiency. Even before then, dozens of countries analysed by the International Energy Agency have been able to improve their energy intensity by 4 per cent or more at least one year in the past 10.\n\nBut meeting the COP28 pledge on a sustained basis will require more active policymaking, which could invite political opposition and public backlash. The agency reckons global efficiency rates would be doubled if every government adopted policies that matched:\n\nOn the issue of air-conditioning: in recognition of the growing risk it poses in a warming world, 63 countries also signed a global cooling pledge at COP28. It aims to cut cooling-related emissions across all sectors by at least 68 per cent globally, though not until 2050.\n\nGiven that timeframe, it is no surprise that experts expect this goal to be met. “We have the solutions,” says Jürgen Fischer, president of climate solutions at Danish industrial group, Danfoss. “It’s a combination of high energy efficiency, environmentally friendly refrigerants and renewable energy for a decarbonised grid that will get us there. Now governments need to turn words into action by creating plans for implementation.”\n\nMeeting the three big energy pledges on oil and gas emissions, renewables, and energy efficiency will require government action, of course. Yet this will not be enough.\n\nEven if all three commitments are met, the IEA has made the dismal calculation that this would only amount to about 30 per cent of the emissions cuts needed to put the world on track for the Paris agreement goal to limit warming to 1.5C.\n\nIn other words, as with so much else in global climate policy, COP28 has taken an important step forward, but it is still not close to the giant strides the world needs.\n\nLetters in response to this article:\n\nFossil fuel addicts need to check into rehab / From Professor Hugh Willmott, Professor of Management, Bayes Business School, London EC1, UK\n\nCar­bon pri­cing is a key tool, but not the only one / From Mark Moody-Stu­art, Has­socks, East Sus­sex, UK",

    "body": "European diplomats fanned out across the expansive grounds of the futuristic conference venue in Dubai on Tuesday in a final push to galvanise support for a global agreement to dump fossil fuels.\n\nThe most intense phase of the talks in the final days of the two-week-long UN COP28 climate summit exposed deep divisions between wealthy and poorer countries over the costs of halting new coal, gas and oil projects.\n\nAlmost 200 countries on Wednesday signed a compromise agreement to transition from fossil fuels that some — including the group of 39 small island states that were not present for the outcome as they scrambled to gather their response — accused of not going far enough.\n\nAfter the deal was struck, the world’s largest oil and gas producer expressed an understanding for those countries that are economically reliant on fossil fuel production.\n\n“I would love it if certain countries had come here and signed on the dotted line and said, ‘we’re finished’,” said John Kerry, the US’s top climate diplomat, referring to fossil fuel production.\n\n“But no, you know, one minister from one of those countries said, ‘John, you can’t ask us to commit economic suicide’.”\n\nSultan al-Jaber, president of COP28 and head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, courted dozens of diplomats and ministers overnight on Tuesday to back the compromise deal.\n\nThis included successive meetings with China’s climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, half-brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who led the resistance to any suggestion of cuts in fossil fuel production.\n\nThe talks, which pushed the world’s most important climate summit almost 24 hours beyond its deadline, laid bare the financial gulf with the countries suffering disproportionately from climate change.\n\nSmall island nations are on the front line of climate change and argue that high levels of debt and high borrowing costs leave them unable to cope with extreme weather events fuelled by global warming.\n\nMona Ainuu, minister for natural resources from the atoll Niue, broke into tears on Monday night as she told reporters: “We need help in the Pacific. We’re drowning as the sea levels rise.”\n\nBut other governments, notably in Africa and Latin America in, argue that exploiting their oil and gas wealth is critical to their economic development.\n\nColombian official Sebastian Carranza Tovar said his country was taking the climate science “seriously”, despite being highly dependent on coal to fund its health and education systems. He described the need for fossil fuel revenues as “one of the most complex problems to solve”.\n\nAvinash Persaud, a negotiator and special climate envoy to Barbados, said any commitment to immediately phase out fossil fuels would be “meaningless” without “the trade, investment and finance to achieve it”.\n\nUltimately, some of these countries found themselves striking a grand bargain to collectively transition from fossil fuels in exchange for an acknowledgment that more money should be made available to poor countries for climate action, beyond the seed capital of some $420mn pledged on the first days of the summit for a loss and damage fund.\n\nThe final COP28 deal underlined the importance of overhauling multilateral developing banks, such as the World Bank, and called on shareholder countries to “significantly scale up the provision of climate finance”.\n\nUnder the agreement, countries also backed “accelerating” the establishment of “new and innovative sources of finance”, such as new taxes to pay for the shift away from fossil fuels.\n\nBut critics argued the agreement was not strong enough on financing, especially for the developing world, and meant the discussion on how to pay for climate change would be pushed further out to COP29 next year.\n\nThe International Energy Agency has said $4.5tn will be needed each year for clean energy alone by the early 2030s, up from $1.8tn now.\n\n“Those most responsible for the climate crisis did not bring finance, technology, or actions to start phasing out fossil fuels,” said Alex Rafalowicz, executive director of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, a campaign that has the endorsement of a bloc of nations and states pushing for a shift away from coal, oil and gas.\n\nTeresa Ribera, deputy prime minister of Spain and co-head of the EU’s COP28 delegation, spent 24 hours negotiating with dozens of countries to drum up support for a more ambitious outcome.\n\nSpeaking after a night where she slept for an hour and a half on a sofa in the Spanish offices on the Expo site, Ribera told the Financial Times the UAE consensus was a “very good deal” that had “been very hard to get”.\n\n“We managed to capture the momentum . . . for a shift from a fossil fuel world towards the fossil fuel free world.”\n\nIt sent a “very powerful signal” that governments across the world planned to step up action on climate change and overhaul their economies to transition away from fossil fuels, she said.\n\nShe suggested investors and businesses would now closely watch countries to see how they put the agreement into practice, in spite of the failure of financial markets to react to the COP28 agreement.\n\n“I don’t expect a huge [immediate] reaction from stock markets, a big slowdown of oil companies and the rise of renewables companies.” But over time, “it is going to be going smoothly up in one direction and smoothly down in the other direction”.\n\nUN climate body chief Simon Stiell said the Dubai “outcome is the beginning of the end” for the fossil fuel industry. “Now all governments and businesses need to turn these pledges into real-economy outcomes, without delay.”\n\nAlden Meyer, senior associate at the climate think-tank E3G, said now countries would be expected to submit new, more ambitious climate targets. “Everyone’s got to rethink what they’re doing based on this decision.”\n\n“Whether that’ll happen is a tall challenge — there’s no legal obligation. It’s just the obligation of ‘what world do you want to leave to your children, to your grandchildren?’ That’s the obligation.”\n\nA triumphant Jaber on Wednesday told the UN plenary session that the UAE-led agreement would preserve the COP28’s “north star” to limit the global temperature rise to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThe agreement includes recognition of the UN conclusion that a cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 compared with 2019 levels, is needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C. This remains far out of reach — instead emissions are expected to rise another 2 per cent this year.\n\nMany scientists questioned whether it was strong enough to halt greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to limit global temperature rises.\n\nJohan Rockström, co-director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said the COP28 agreement was a “pivotal landmark” but it “will not enable the world to hold the 1.5C limit”.",

    "body": "Hello from Dubai. After two consecutive nights of intense negotiations that ran into the small hours, COP28 has ended in a deal.\n\nThe “global stocktake” agreed here has broken with the shameful inability of previous UN climate conferences to state openly the need to move away from fossil fuels. COP president Sultan al-Jaber — who has received huge criticism over his conflicts of interest as a major oil company chief executive — deserves credit for persuading big oil producers, notably Saudi Arabia to support this deal.\n\nYet this agreement leaves a vast amount of work to be done. And to some eyes, this COP has been yet another failure, given that we still don’t have a clear path to the end of fossil fuel usage.\n\nThat message was given voice at the closing plenary by Anne Rasmussen, lead negotiator for Samoa, who complained that she and other small island state representatives were still in discussion outside the hall when the agreement was approved. “We see a litany of loopholes,” she said. “We cannot afford to return to our islands with the message that this process has failed us.” — Simon Mundy\n\nTo many observers of COP28, saying that we need to move away from fossil fuels to tackle climate change will seem like a statement of the bleeding obvious. It’s a fair point, which is why the failure to say this in the 27 previous COPs was so egregious — and why the fossil fuel language in this text is significant.\n\nMany countries, including the EU and the Alliance of Small Island States, had pushed at COP28 for a commitment to “phase out” fossil fuels. That term didn’t make it into the text. Instead, it called on nations to contribute to:\n\nSome analysts have expressed severe disappointment with this language, saying that unlike “phase out”, it doesn’t necessarily mean that fossil fuel usage is on the way to zero. Still less does this text give a clear deadline for stopping fossil fuel usage. But “transitioning away from” still seems a tad stronger than “reducing” or “phasing down”, which were other options on offer.\n\nIt’s also notable that this clause talks about moving away from fossil fuels in energy systems altogether, not just “unabated” usage. The latter phrasing would have implied no need to transition away from fossil fuels, provided you use carbon capture technology.\n\nCarbon capture appears in the very next clause, however, as one of the green technologies that countries are encouraged to “accelerate” — something that will concern those who worry that it will help prop up the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe language agreed at COP26 on “accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power” survives unchanged, despite efforts here to strengthen wording around the most polluting fossil fuel.\n\nAnother clause that has prompted some queasiness is the statement “that transitional fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition while ensuring energy security”. This is an apparent reference to fossil gas, which is presented by advocates as a less polluting alternative to coal.\n\nThe text introduces its language about energy systems by saying that countries can take into account “their different national circumstances, pathways and approaches” — wording that some governments may use to push for flexibility around their obligations.\n\nAt the plenary discussion where the deal was approved, a succession of developing nations stressed the urgent need for rich countries to provide more support on climate finance.\n\nThe global stocktake had some decent language on the scale of this challenge. It warned of the “growing gap” between the finance that developing countries need to fund their climate-related obligations, and the support that they have so far secured. Their adaptation finance needs are estimated at $215bn-$387bn a year this decade, it warned.\n\nYet even as it acknowledged that adaptation finance “will have to be significantly scaled up” beyond the doubling (from 2019 levels, by 2025) that has already been agreed, the text was short on detail of how this will be achieved.\n\nSimilarly, while the text welcomed the first funding provided for the new climate loss and damage fund, these commitments — amounting to less than $1bn — amount to “an initial downpayment”, as Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, told reporters today.\n\nA massive increase in funding for low-carbon energy is also needed. One of the key wins for COP28 president Sultan al-Jaber was the agreement here to triple renewable energy capacity globally, and double the average rate of energy efficiency improvements, by 2030.\n\nThe text made clear that climate finance — both to restrain climate change, and to respond to its impacts — will “need to increase manyfold”.\n\nIt noted that the capital is there to close the investment gap, but noted “barriers to redirecting capital to climate action”. Interestingly, it named taxation as one of the “new and innovative sources of finance” for governments to explore — a promising area, as we highlighted last week.\n\nFilling in these climate finance gaps will be at the top of the agenda at next year’s COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The preparations for that event should begin today. (Simon Mundy)\n\n“This outcome reflects the very lowest possible ambition that we could accept rather than what we know, according to the best available science, is necessary to urgently address the climate crisis.”\n\n— Madeleine Diouf Sarr, chair of the Least Developed Countries Group\n\nPermitting rules are holding back green investment in the US, writes Brooke Masters.",

    "body": "The outcome is very far from perfect. It is better than feared but less than needed. It bows too much to the forces of international diplomacy, and too little to the immovable realities of science. Yet the COP28 climate conference in Dubai has delivered a historic and unmistakable message that the global energy system must move away from the use of coal, oil and gas.\n\nThis follows a two-week meeting in which the fundamental clash between the need for climate action and the economic reliance on fossil fuels has been laid bare to an extent rarely seen. The final agreement calls on countries to shift away from fossil fuel use for energy in order to reach net zero emissions by 2050. After nearly 30 years of UN climate COPs, this is the first to specify the need for such a decline in the use of all fossil fuels, by far the biggest contributor to global warming.\n\nThe meeting of almost every country in the world also agreed that this shift should be accelerated “in this critical decade”, “in keeping with the science”. And it recognised that limiting global warming to 1.5C required emissions almost to halve by 2030.\n\nThis message would nonetheless have been far sharper had the final agreement spelt out firm deadlines for when fossil fuel use should peak and decline this decade. Many countries had sought such an outcome in Dubai, not least those most vulnerable to climate change. The stakes are especially high when the US could soon be led again by a president who just a few years ago pulled the country out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\n\nAs part of the Paris accord, COP28 had to come up with a deal that guided countries’ future plans to meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. This guidance is now more muted than many nations would have liked. But as John Kerry, the US climate envoy, told the conference on Wednesday: “We know this was a compromise between many parties.” Such compromises have long prevailed in UN-sponsored climate meetings, where decisions are made by consensus. Calls for future COPs to make decisions by a majority vote will be strengthened by this meeting.\n\nThe dynamics of this summit were rocked by the leak of a letter from the head of Opec to oil-producing nations that openly urged them to “reject any test or formula that targets energy, ie fossil fuels, rather than emissions”. The oil cartel did not in the end get its way, though nor did nations seeking a stronger agreement.\n\nOpec’s intervention underlines an often overlooked reality of climate COPs. These meetings are frequently dismissed as hot air, and they cannot instantly change anything on the ground. But they normalise ideas and measures once seen as too radical to be globally agreed, such as the need to shift away from fossil fuels — which Opec well understands.\n\nAgainst somewhat pessimistic expectations, moreover, the COP hosts United Arab Emirates, and its president Sultan al-Jaber — who heads the national company Adnoc — presided over a conference that produced some important measures even beyond the headline call on fossil fuels. In a rare move, national oil companies agreed to cut their emissions, though not their production levels. Countries agreed to triple renewable energy capacity and double global energy efficiency rates by 2030.\n\nA long-sought climate loss and damage fund was approved as wealthy countries committed more than $400mn on day one in a move that has allowed the fund to get up and running. A $30bn UAE commitment for a separate climate finance fund that aims to mobilise $250bn in green investments by 2030 is also positive, as are the billions of dollars in climate finance pledges from the public and private sector. But the global energy transition requires those billions to become trillions — so it was welcome, too, to see multilateral development banks offer new plans to scale up climate finance.\n\nUltimately, individual governments, banks, investors and companies will decide whether all these goals are met. COP28 missed the chance to offer firmer signposts on the speed and scale of global climate action. But it still marks a step forward — rather than the retreat that many had feared.",

    "body": "The US has hit companies in Turkey, the UAE and China with sanctions as part of a sweeping effort to stop the Russian defence industry easily obtaining sensitive technologies for Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.\n\nMore than 250 entities were covered by the measures, which also reached deep into Russia’s war economy, even targeting a provincial bakery refitted to make drones.\n\nThe latest US package is timed to coincide with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington this week, a show of support for Kyiv even amid political roadblocks that have raised doubts about future military aid.\n\nThe sanctions target military contractors and civilian companies that have turned to supporting Russia’s war effort, leading to increasing confidence from the Kremlin that it can bolster its arsenal while western resolve to support Ukraine crumbles.\n\n“We will continue to use the tools at our disposal to promote accountability for Russia’s crimes in Ukraine and those who finance and support Russia’s war machine,” said US secretary of state Antony Blinken.\n\nUkraine’s allies are particularly concerned about Russia using countries such as Turkey, the UAE and China either as sources or conduits for high-end electronics and high-precision goods that Moscow’s war effort is unable to produce domestically.\n\nThe US measures also target companies that have helped transfer munitions and military equipment from North Korea to bolster Russia’s defence stocks.\n\nNorth Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has swung to supporting Moscow after meeting Putin in September, supplying the Russian military with much-needed artillery rounds.\n\nBut the US’s main focus is on industrial companies in Russia, many of which are civilian companies that have switched to producing defence equipment under Putin’s drive to put the economy on a war footing.\n\nThe continued supplies of technologies from advanced microchips to ball bearings have helped keep artillery, drones and missiles rolling off the production lines at Russian factories. Putin boasted last week that Ukraine’s overreliance on western backing doomed it to lose the war.\n\n“When you don’t have your own raison d'être, no ideology, industry, money, or anything of your own, then you don’t have a future. And we do,” Putin told a group of servicemen in comments published on Sunday.\n\nThe Financial Times reported in November that Nato member Turkey’s exports of military-linked parts to Russia have soared since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.\n\nThe US, EU, UK and other western partners say these so-called high-priority goods are items of particular value to Russia’s war effort and include microchips, navigation equipment and scopes.\n\nJanet Yellen, US Treasury secretary, said: “Our sanctions today continue to tighten the vice on willing third-country suppliers and networks providing Russia the inputs it desperately needs to ramp up and sustain its military-industrial base.”\n\nWashington and Brussels are particularly frustrated that Turkish companies are purchasing dual-use items, which have commercial and military applications, from western suppliers and then re-exporting them to Russia either directly or through intermediaries in central Asia and eastern Europe.\n\nOne of the newly sanctioned Turkish companies, Kartal Exim, describes itself as a “multifunctional supplier of technological equipment”. Russian records suggest it has shipped about $2.1mn of goods to Orlan LLC — a St Petersburg company that is a self-described fishing equipment supplier.\n\nBy far the largest category of goods shipped from Kartal Exim to Orlan, worth $1.1mn, was listed as “data transmission” equipment, a category on the high-priority goods list. The items, shipped from Istanbul, were made by western suppliers including Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Fujitsu, Dell and Samsung. Kartal did not respond to an FT request for comment.\n\nWhile Turkey has not applied western sanctions directly on Russia, it says “strict monitoring and prevention of efforts to skirt sanctions through Turkey is an integral part of our . . . policy”.\n\nIn the UAE the new sanctions have targeted 12 companies, many of which are involved in moving aircraft parts into Russia. One of the sanctioned entities is Aspect DWC, a UAE company which, according to Russian customs records, has been shipped parts for Dassault business jets.\n\nA significant focus of sanctions on Chinese companies was a procurement network run by Hu Xiaoxun, a businessman. According to the US Treasury, his company — Jarvis HK — has exported ammunition, loitering munitions and semiconductor microchip manufacturing equipment from China into Russia.\n\nThe US also listed 17 other Chinese entities, including Beijing Yunze Technology and Chang Guang Satellite Technology.\n\nAccording to the listing, the two companies supplied satellite imagery used in Russian operations, including by the Wagner Group. Russia, the Treasury noted, had become “reliant on PRC commercial satellite imagery”.\n\nThe US also targeted Ivan Tavrin, a private equity executive who has emerged as a central dealmaker for western companies looking to exit Russia, and Expobank, which has financed several of those deals.",

    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has brought new terrorism charges against dozens of imprisoned activists, rights groups reported, as the autocratic Gulf monarchy steps up its crackdown on dissent while hosting the UN COP28 climate summit in Dubai.\n\nEighty-seven Emiratis were summoned to an appeals court in the capital Abu Dhabi for a mass trial on December 7, according to the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Centre. They were accused of setting up or supporting and financing a terrorist organisation.\n\nThe overseas advocacy group said it was concerned about the apparent fabrication of charges which carry severe penalties, including the death sentence and life imprisonment.\n\nThe 87 Emiratis facing a renewed trial include Islamist activists who were imprisoned after the Arab spring protests of 2011, when calls were made for democratic elections in the autocratic UAE, as well as human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor, who was detained in 2017. Some of the defendants facing new charges are living in exile.\n\n“The decision to lay new terrorism charges on this scale in the middle of the talks, when the UAE is under the global spotlight, is a giant slap in the face to the country’s human rights community and the COP process,” said James Lynch, co-director of human rights organisation FairSquare.\n\nThe UAE did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Gulf state has long argued that its tough approach to domestic security prevents the political instability seen in many Middle East countries from spilling over into the region’s tourism and business hub.\n\nHuman rights groups last week organised a protest for the UAE’s prisoners of conscience in the UN-administered “blue zone” at the COP climate summit in Dubai. It was a rare public acknowledgment of their plight in a country where criticism of the state has been criminalised and protests are prohibited.\n\nThe demonstration was delayed several times as activists negotiated terms of the action with the UN, including having to remove written references to the detainees, in an apparent indication of the sensitivity of the protest.\n\nSome of the 87 individuals facing new charges are from the so-called UAE 94 group including prominent figures such as lawyer Mohammed al-Roken, who were imprisoned for terms of up to 10 years in 2013 for plotting to overthrow the government.\n\nDozens of these prisoners have completed their sentences but have not been released. People close to the government have said anti-terrorism legislation has been invoked to prolong their sentences.\n\nMary Lawlor, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights defenders, said she was “appalled” to hear about the new terrorism charges against individuals who are “held in poor conditions”.\n\nIn a post on X she said “the UAE cannot parade itself as a defender of rights”.",

    "blurb": "Abu Dhabi-backed G42 says it ‘cannot work with both sides’ and retain access to American-made AI chips",
    "date": "2023-12-0700:00:00.0",
    "body": "A leading Gulf artificial intelligence company has said it is cutting ties with Chinese hardware suppliers in favour of US counterparts, in a sign of the growing geopolitical struggle over the new technology.\n\nG42 of the United Arab Emirates is making the move to ensure its access to US-made chips by allaying concerns among its American partners, which include Microsoft and OpenAI, chief executive Peng Xiao said.\n\n“For better or worse, as a commercial company, we are in a position where we have to make a choice,” Xiao told the Financial Times. “We cannot work with both sides. We can’t.”\n\nG42’s ventures include the launch of an Arabic large language model. Its investors include Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, and the US private equity group Silver Lake.\n\nXiao was speaking just before reports last month that claimed to shed new light on G42’s deep links to China. According to The New York Times, US officials are worried by the Emirati company’s relationship with groups including telecoms giant Huawei.\n\nThe report suggested the US also raised concerns that G42 could provide a route for US AI technology and Americans’ genetic data to reach the Chinese government and companies.\n\nXiao said G42 was phasing out hardware from Huawei, which had provided servers and data centre networking gear. He added that G42 had decided to pull back from its China relationships to appease its US corporate partners and to ensure it complied with Washington’s rules on exports of advanced chips.\n\n“The impression we are getting from [the] US government and US partners is, we need to be very cautious,” Xiao said.\n\nHe added: “In order for us to further our relationship — which we cherish — with our US partners, we simply cannot do much more with [previous] Chinese partners.”\n\nG42 declined to comment on recent reporting about its links to Chinese groups. It said it had been “at the forefront of technological advancements” and had made an “overwhelmingly positive” contribution to work on AI governance, ethics and regulation.\n\nHowever, Xiao, who was born in China, studied in the US and is now a UAE citizen, added that G42 had never had “deep AI research relationships” with Chinese partners “because, frankly speaking, they’re not leaders in this domain”.\n\nThe decision by G42 to cut some ties to China shows how Gulf countries with ambitious AI agendas have become battlegrounds in the competition between China and the US over the fast-advancing field.In September, G42 and Microsoft announced an expansion of their partnership with a plan to make sovereign cloud offerings available to the UAE, work together on advanced AI capabilities and expand data centre infrastructure in the Gulf state.\n\nThe following month, G42 and OpenAI unveiled an agreement to use the Microsoft-backed start-up’s generative AI models in areas where the Emirati group has expertise, including financial services, energy, healthcare and public services.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI declined to comment.\n\nG42 and its chair, UAE national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, have been crucial to the country’s push to diversify its geopolitical partnerships to secure access to the latest technologies.\n\nHowever, G42 has been caught up in controversies. Reports suggest it has been involved in the development of ToTok, a UAE chat app allegedly used by the government to spy on the users’ phones. G42 did not respond to a request for comment about its alleged part in the creation of ToTok.\n\nThe UAE sees itself as a node within a new multipolar world, where China, India and Russia have emerged as counterpoints to the west’s historic economic dominance. But the global scramble for AI chips, particularly those made by US chipmaker Nvidia, has limited Abu Dhabi’s room to pivot away from Washington’s orbit.\n\nThe UAE chose Huawei to install the first national 5G infrastructure in 2019, despite US objections, citing an unavailability of similar technology from western partners promoted by Washington. Since then, however, state companies have signed further deals with Sweden’s Ericsson as the UAE pursues a policy of diversifying its telecommunications partners.\n\nThe growing row over G42 highlights how it is hard for companies to simply pick the US or China when both have “a lot to offer” on AI, said Nikki Sun, an academy associate in the digital society initiative at the Chatham House think-tank.\n\n“It’s unsurprising that G42, as an AI-focused start-up, engages with China, given China’s extensive role in the global AI value chain, from hardware, talent, to end market,” said Sun, who is also a fellow at Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic venture led by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt. “Severing these connections entirely seems very unlikely.”\n\nG42 insists its “extensive network” of international relationships is “no different” from “any other global technology company, including US companies”.\n\nG42 has partnered with Sinopharm, the drugs company, and BGI, the genomics research group, in relationships that originated during the Covid-19 pandemic. Sinopharm trialled and later manufactured and distributed its Covid vaccine in the UAE, while G42 worked with BGI to build a detection centre for the disease in the country.\n\nWhen US officials have complained about the UAE’s growing ties with Beijing, Emirati officials have replied that Washington’s reluctance to supply cutting-edge technologies gives them no choice but to co-operate with China.\n\nUS reluctance to sell high-tech military equipment to the UAE and Saudi Arabia has allowed China to fill this vacuum and become an increasingly important player in the regional arms market.\n\nAdditional reporting by Richard Waters and George Hammond in San Francisco",

    "body": "Vladimir Putin has met the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as part of the first visit by the Russian president to the Gulf region since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago.\n\nThe two-stop tour on Wednesday is seen as Moscow’s attempt to show it can maintain close ties with the Gulf despite western attempts to force the region to comply with restrictions and sanctions against Russia.\n\nPutin enjoys warm relations with both the oil-exporting Gulf states, which have remained neutral over Ukraine since the full invasion of February last year. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have not ratified the statute that governs the International Criminal Court, which has indicted the Russian president for alleged war crimes.\n\nThe Russian leader is also keen to show that his country has not been isolated from the world because of the war, ahead of upcoming presidential elections in 2024.\n\nVideo of the meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, day-to-day leader of Saudi Arabia, published by Russian state media showed Putin describing the talks as “very timely”. He also said it was “very important to exchange information and assessments about what is happening in the region”.\n\nPrince Mohammed and Putin discussed “working together to achieve stability in the Middle East”, the Saudi broadcaster Al Arabiya reported, as well as highlighting their successful co-operation in energy, trade and investment.\n\nPutin also invited Prince Mohammed to visit Russia, Al Arabiya said.\n\nEarlier, after meeting the Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan in Abu Dhabi, Putin thanked the ruler for the “UAE’s stance”, saying this had allowed relations between the two countries to reach “an unprecedentedly high level”.\n\nRussian news agencies published a video of Putin’s arrival that included a fleet of jets flying over the UAE’s presidential palace, painting the sky in the colours of the Russian flag.\n\nPutin used his trip to discuss a range of issues, from energy and trade co-operation to the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nHe brought a delegation of high-ranking Russian officials with him, including central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina, his top energy official Alexander Novak and Denis Manturov, Russia’s trade minister, who has a mandate to restore supply chains. Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman leader of Chechnya, was also in attendance.\n\nRepresentatives of the most important Russian energy companies also took part in the talks, according to state news agencies.\n\nThe UAE has become the main international hub for Russian businesses and a significant route for circumventing western sanctions. According to Putin, the turnover of goods between Russia and the country rose 68 per cent in 2022. “I believe this year [the growth] will be even greater,” he added.\n\nPrince Mohammed and Sheikh Mohammed have developed personal relationships with Putin and touted themselves as interlocutors between Russia and the west. The two have been central to various mediation efforts relating to the Ukraine war, including prisoner swaps.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s economic partnership with Russia has been most strongly felt in the oil market. Prince Mohammed played a crucial role in helping bring Moscow into a broader Opec+ grouping, which last week expanded and deepened output cuts.",

    "date": "2023-12-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "One day in late October, leaders from more than a dozen towns across Liberia’s Gbi-Doru rainforest crammed into a whitewashed, tin-roofed church.\n\nThey had gathered to hear for the first time about a deal signed by their national government proposing to give Blue Carbon, a private investment vehicle based thousands of miles away in Dubai, exclusive rights to develop carbon credits on land they claim as theirs.\n\n“None of them were aware of the Blue Carbon deal,” says Andrew Zeleman, who helps lead Liberia’s unions of foresters.\n\nOnly two of the leaders were even remotely familiar with the concept of a carbon credit, he adds — the tradeable instrument that can be obtained when a tonne of carbon is removed from the atmosphere or avoided, for example because a forest has been planted, or protected from deforestation.\n\nBlue Carbon, a private company whose founder and chair Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook al-Maktoum is a member of Dubai’s royal family, is in discussions to acquire management rights to millions of hectares of land in Africa. The scale is enormous: the negotiations involve potential deals for about a tenth of Liberia’s land mass, a fifth of Zimbabwe’s, and swaths of Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania.\n\nBlue Carbon’s intention is to sell the emission reductions linked to forest conservation in these regions as carbon credits, under an unfinished international accounting framework for carbon markets being designed by the UN. In a market that is being designed for and by governments, Blue Carbon is among the most active private brokers.\n\nClimate negotiators meeting in the United Arab Emirates for the COP28 summit this week have been looking to finalise this framework, with the aim of sounding the starting gun on a new market in carbon credits which would allow countries to shrink their own carbon footprints by buying emission reductions from others.\n\nThe trade is supposed to be simple. The 195 countries that have signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement committed to setting targets for reducing their carbon emissions by 2030. If a country exceeds these or future targets — for instance through switching to renewables, or reforesting territory that increases carbon stocks — it can sell those additional emission reductions to another country.\n\nThe UAE, alongside other governments such as Switzerland and South Korea, has been betting that these international carbon markets could be a central pillar in the climate solutions offered to world leaders at COP28.\n\nThe existing international market for carbon credits is worth about $2bn, with roughly four in 10 credits sold based on nature restoration projects. Private buyers, from companies to individuals, can buy offsets for their own emissions to meet their own reduction goals. Brokers similar to Blue Carbon obtain rights to buy and sell credits, taking a cut of their value.\n\nUntil recently, governments had steered clear of buying and selling directly into this market. But as targets to cut national emissions by 2030 speed into sight, importing carbon credits at scale has become increasingly attractive. And as plans for a national scheme have emerged, there has been a new rush for access to resources in countries rich in biodiversity.\n\nSouth Korea, Switzerland, Japan, the UAE and Singapore are among the states to have struck 95 preliminary deals since the start of 2021 to buy future emission reductions from countries including Ghana, Vietnam and Senegal, according to data from MSCI carbon markets.\n\nA carbon credit boom could channel money towards poorer countries with smaller carbon footprints and higher financing needs, to help them address the effects of increasingly extreme weather and temperature changes.\n\nBut the scale and speed of dealmaking between countries over available land have sparked concern about a lack of guardrails around this system.\n\nSeller countries are not being given enough time to develop a natural resource strategy that would promote a fair trade in carbon credits, say community leaders and activists in the countries where Blue Carbon is active.\n\nKey issues include revenue-sharing, land rights and the potential impact on the host countries’ ability to hit its own climate target.\n\n“The [methods] of exploitation might be new but the consequences are not so different to the last 200 years of land grabs in Liberia,” says David Young, an independent expert on civil society’s role in forest governance in the country. “The promises to the communities are vague and unpredictable and it’s like logging or mining or palm oil all over again.”\n\nScientists have also warned about the broader risk to the planet of giving big polluters a green light to continue pumping oil and gas based on purchases made from the existing unregulated market for credits.\n\nAnd scientists including Thales West, of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam’s Institute for Environmental Studies, have argued the market is underpinned by tenuous accounting standards, based on scenarios that overestimate both volumes of carbon removed from the atmosphere and the permanence of these removals.\n\n“We are fooling ourselves when we purchase these offsets,” West has said.\n\nCarbon credits are part of the UAE’s official strategy to cut its national emissions by 2030, alongside other investments including in hydrogen gas and decarbonising steel production.\n\nAfter the country pledged $450mn to help develop African carbon markets in September, Mohamed Ben Salem, who leads on voluntary carbon markets for the UAE’s presidency of the climate conference, announced in October the UAE would like to see a 50-fold increase in the size of this market globally.\n\n“Voluntary carbon markets can drive real, on the ground effective climate action . . . with significant co-benefits to climate, local communities and nature,” he said at a conference in London.\n\nAnd reforestation is likely to be a central part of future carbon markets. A peer-reviewed study published in Nature journal last month estimated that 139 gigatonnes of carbon could be removed from the atmosphere by better protecting existing forested areas where relatively few people live or work.\n\nThis is more than six times the carbon that the UN’s environment programme has said needs to be cut from annual emissions by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nFor François Megret, head of carbon trading at First Abu Dhabi Bank — which is the UAE’s biggest lender, an official partner of the COP28 summit and a backer of Blue Carbon — carbon trading between states should start as soon as possible. “We don’t have 20 years and we don’t want to lose these two years or three years to activate something,” he said at the same conference.\n\nBut some of the earliest deals are being criticised for their lack of transparency and accountability. Liberia, unlike other countries approached by Blue Carbon, does not yet have a law governing the sale and taxation of carbon credits.\n\nA copy of Blue Carbon’s memorandum of understanding with Liberia, dated July and seen by the Financial Times, proposed to give the Dubai-based company exclusive rights to generate and sell carbon credits on about 1mn hectares of Liberian land. It would receive 70 per cent of the value of the credits for the next three decades, and sell these tax-free for a decade. The government would receive the other 30 per cent, with some of this going to local communities.\n\nCommunity consultation was due to take place between August and November, according to the document. But Zeleman says that the local leaders he engages with on the land have still not been consulted about the deal.\n\nBlue Carbon denies failing to consult with communities and says it will follow all government “laws, rules and regulations . . . once formal binding agreements are entered into”. It adds: “Blue Carbon is mindful of all community and human rights including land rights in Liberia.”\n\nSome activists have heavily criticised the proposed deal. Allowing a foreign company to manage such a big portion of Liberian land would endanger the livelihoods and community land ownership of up to a million people, groups including the Rainforest Foundation UK, Friends of the Earth and Earthsight wrote in a letter earlier this year.\n\nThe government was “handing over decisions about how a substantial part of its carbon emissions for the next 30 years are to be managed [to] a UAE firm that has existed for less than a year, and which has no track record in carbon trading,” they said in the letter.\n\nNo contract with Blue Carbon has yet been signed, says Wilson Tarpeh, head of Liberia’s Environmental Protection Agency, who flew to Dubai over the summer to discuss the proposal. Liberia’s government is working on developing a legal framework for carbon developers that highlights “carbon belongs to the state”, he says, and is also consulting with civil society on the Blue Carbon project. “We value their position.”\n\nTarpeh estimates that Liberia had 2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide locked into its forest, absorbed through photosynthesis. “The size of the carbon stock is huge, so anybody will be tempted to sell our carbon,” he says. “But it has to be a rules-based system. It’s not like buying a candy bar.”\n\nOther countries approached by Blue Carbon have been in a stronger position to respond.\n\nThe foreign and environment ministers of South America’s Suriname, another small country almost entirely covered in tropical forest, received a similar offer to that of Liberia when they flew out for pitch meetings with al-Maktoum in Blue Carbon’s offices in the Burj Al Salam skyscraper in Dubai in August.\n\nSuriname’s gross domestic product per capita is about 10 times greater than Liberia’s and its government has more than a decade of experience engaging with financing mechanisms for emission reduction, including under the UN’s ill-fated Clean Development Mechanism, which had its roots in the 1997 Kyoto protocol eventually superseded by the Paris agreement.\n\nSo the ministers were better able to push back against Blue Carbon’s initial proposal to take a significant cut of future carbon credit revenues, according to an adviser to Suriname on the deal who asked not to be named.\n\nA person close to Suriname’s environment ministry confirmed that it was still considering Blue Carbon’s latest updated offer, alongside other offers for its 4.8mn credits tied to national deforestation reduction.\n\nBut such offers can be hard to turn down. “[Blue Carbon’s] pitch is that they have untold wealth from the royal family,” the adviser says, a powerful incentive for poorer countries looking to insure themselves against volatility in carbon pricing.\n\nApproached by the FT about its offers to Suriname, Blue Carbon said it wanted to investigate “these false allegations”, but did not specify details.\n\nOther countries have moved to put protections around their arrangements. In Tanzania, a tough taxation regime for carbon credit trading came into force shortly before Blue Carbon signed a memorandum of understanding for future development of 8mn hectares of forest in February with the country’s forestry agency. Local authorities receive 61 per cent of revenues from carbon credit sales.\n\nBlue Carbon has not said what proportion of the credits it develops in Liberia, Kenya and elsewhere it would sell to the UAE versus selling these on to other countries, or potentially other companies. The investment vehicle told the FT it expects a “diverse customer and buyer base”, and operated separately to the government.\n\nAs negotiators from each country present at COP28 battle over how best to strengthen the framework for governments to trade carbon credits, one priority is to avoid repeating mistakes made by corporate buyers and sellers on issues of accounting and human rights.\n\nDirk Forrester, head of the International Emissions Trading Association, representing carbon traders and developers, says developing countries are losing investment because of a slowdown in appetite for carbon credits in voluntary markets. “It’s like someone hit the great reset button in the sky . . . and [the pull back] appears to be slowing climate action rather than accelerating it.”\n\nIn particular, scientists have pointed to several flaws in the idea of issuing credits to reward a developer for protecting a forest from hypothetical future deforestation, as Blue Carbon is expected to do.\n\nVerra, the largest accreditation body for voluntary credits, has denied claims that it over-credited projects based on inflated projections of future deforestation. But at the same time it says it is rethinking its methodology for forest-based credits.\n\nThe UN supervisory bodies tasked with rewriting the rules for the international carbon credit market hope negotiators at the summit convene on a common standard.\n\n“I think there is no moral justification for independent standards to exist,” Olga Gassan-zade, head of one of the bodies, told the FT before the start of the summit. She hopes the UN’s mechanisms would one day eclipse the private sector approval systems for credits that have been tarnished by controversies in the past year. “We are able to move forward on nature-based [credits] and learn from their mistakes.”\n\nUnder the UN’s nascent system, governments must cancel out any emission reductions sold within their borders by inflating their own carbon footprint, to avoid double counting between countries. This could boost public confidence in the stated climate benefit of carbon credits, analysts say. But it would also heighten political risk for foreign developers of carbon credits, because each credit sold makes it harder for a government to hit its own climate target.\n\nNo matter the fairness of the terms, poorer countries will continue to be attracted to carbon credit deals because of the scarcity of other financing to help pay for the effects of climate change, argues Gilles Dufrasne, a policy lead at the non-profit Carbon Market Watch.\n\n“Richer countries have not delivered the climate finance [developing countries] need so they are turning to what they can access . . . and the only system that seems mainstream and hyped at the moment is carbon credits.”\n\nIn defining what counts as a carbon credit and who should profit from them, the stakes are high. Honduras has already deployed a tenth of its standing army to protect its forest stock and to boost its chances of selling deforestation reduction credits to richer countries in future.\n\n“It’s about climate justice”, says Lucky Medina, the country’s minister for natural resources and the environment. “The vision is that the money [from carbon credits] is for the countries, not individuals . . . in a sovereign market, the carbon cowboys or brokers should not exist.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Aanu Adeoye in Lagos.

    "body": "Some arrived to discover their badge was only valid for two days of the 13-day conference. Some had to wait so long to make a late afternoon speech, they ended up addressing a hall left empty by delegates who had headed to dinner. And they were far from the only luckless industry captains last week at the vast COP28 climate conference in Dubai.\n\nJohn Neal, chief executive of the Lloyd’s of London insurance market, was among a raft of business leaders who queued for more than two hours in the desert heat to enter the sprawling Dubai Expo City conference venue.\n\nOne business adviser later confided he and his boss were trying to avoid the Expo venue as much as possible. “It’s much easier to just stick to the hotels.”\n\nBy that he meant the plush hotels dotted around the city where executives have gathered for a parallel series of COP business events, far from the chaotic bustle of the actual COP.\n\nBut if business finds COPs hard going, the feeling can be mutual.\n\nThis finding has emerged from research carried out by Archie Young, the UK’s former lead climate negotiator, now at Harvard’s Kennedy School.\n\nHe recently spent months interviewing government officials, negotiators, NGOs and business people for the Centre for Multilateral Negotiations, a group set up to foster successful global talks.\n\nThe effort was sparked by concerns that the mushrooming presence of businesses at COPs wasn’t advancing the conferences’ core aim of tackling climate change as well as it could or should.\n\n“The growing numbers of companies here offer a big opportunity to advance climate action, but it’s becoming clear that it needs to be carefully managed,” Young told me over an orange juice at another venue for business events miles from the COP28 centre.\n\nHis interviewees were broadly positive about the advantages business could potentially bring to COPs. But some climate negotiators had also said the “circus” of business events, kiosks and panels was making COPs too crowded and chaotic. “One said explicitly, ‘It hinders and hampers our work. There are too many people here’,” he said, adding that was a minority view.\n\nThe critics weren’t talking about the fossil fuel groups that have been coming to COPs since the first one in 1995 and are here in force at COP28. Rather, it’s the fact that scores of other companies now come to COPs, from drug groups to banks, big tech and truckmakers.\n\nYet private sector expertise — and investment — is needed now that UN climate talks are supposed to be implementing an accord, the 2015 Paris Agreement, not forging a new one.\n\nAn estimated $5tn a year of low-carbon investments will be needed by 2030. And as Ajay Banga, the World Bank Group president, told a Bloomberg conference on Sunday, all the world’s multilateral development banks, governments and philanthropies put together “don’t have that kind of money”. “Not even Mike,” he added, referring to the billionaire founder of the financial data and news group, Michael Bloomberg.\n\nBut navigating a global energy transition at speed also requires technical expertise and business experience.\n\nYoung concluded COPs needed better ways to enhance business and government collaboration. And executives need to recognise it’s no good if, as he puts it, “business only turns up for a pavilion, a panel and some prosecco”.\n\nIn other words, they need to be aware COPs are not just another corporate event.\n\nOne chief executive, ExxonMobil’s Darren Woods, had a brush with this reality last week. He arrived in Dubai for his first COP just as nearly 120 countries pledged to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nWoods has long championed other technologies that in theory allow fossil fuels to be burnt cleanly, such as carbon capture. But when he repeated his thoughts in an interview with the Financial Times in Dubai, they did not land well.\n\nThat’s partly because the businesses coming to COP are changing. They now include big green energy groups willing to take on the likes of Exxon as vigorously as any green activist.\n\nGreg Jackson, founder of the UK’s fast-growing Octopus Energy Group, told me Woods’ remarks revealed that some fossil fuel companies were “admitting that they can’t do this” energy transition.\n\nAndrew Forrest, the Australian mining magnate and green hydrogen champion, went further. Fossil fuel companies might come to COPs to talk about prolonging their industry, he said. “But we invented COPs to save the planet,” he added, “not save a few businesses.”\n\npilita.clark@ft.com",

    "date": "2023-12-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "The United Arab Emirates is set to take a large minority stake in a second UK offshore wind farm in the space of a week, as the Gulf state seeks to capitalise on difficult conditions in the industry to expand in Britain.\n\nThe proposed investment in the new East Anglia Three offshore wind farm, which state-backed renewables company Masdar intends to finalise in the first quarter, is among a string of deals that oil-reliant UAE has signed at the COP28 climate conference, as it seeks to boost its green credentials.\n\nThe proposed investment also comes amid scrutiny of Emirati investment in other UK assets, including its part in an attempt to purchase the Telegraph Media Group.\n\nMasdar, which is chaired by COP28 president Sultan al-Jaber, hopes to buy up to a 49 per cent stake in the 1.4 gigawatt wind farm under construction off the Norfolk coast — set to be one of the UK’s largest — from Spanish energy company Iberdrola.\n\nThe decision to back the project, due to start producing power in 2026, shows that the UAE is prepared to invest in projects that many developers believe have become uneconomical after government contracts locked in low prices for the electricity they produce.\n\nThe sector has run into trouble as spiralling costs have cast doubt over the viability of projects awarded at relatively low prices under the UK’s contracts-for-difference scheme. Some developers are now seeking additional government support to continue with the projects.\n\nEast Anglia Three has a strike price of £37.35 per megawatt hour, the guaranteed maximum price the government pays operators for the electricity they generate, though it is further advanced than many other projects with construction expected to start next spring.\n\nLast month, the government increased the maximum strike price for its next offshore wind auction to £73 per megawatt hour to reflect more challenging conditions in the sector.\n\nHusain Al Meer, Masdar’s director of global offshore wind and UK, told the Financial Times that the “market has been going through a tough time” but that this represented an opportunity for the state-backed company to deploy “dry powder”. “We have a lot of capital to deploy, but we are very selective”, he said.\n\nAsked about criticism of Emirati investment in the UK, including the Telegraph deal, he said: “We enjoy a very strong relationship with the UK. We’ve been investing in the UK for a long time; this is part of our commitment to the UK that we will keep investing in infrastructure and the energy transition.”\n\nThe proposed deal follows the launch by the UAE of a $30bn climate-related investment fund with BlackRock, TPG and Brookfield.\n\nAnalysis by the Financial Times last week found that UAE state companies and funds could be linked to almost $200bn in global investments in the year leading up to the COP summit, mostly in green energy.\n\nUtility companies often sell stakes in their facilities after the initial development stage but Masdar’s recent large investments show it is taking an active role in the development of wind farms.\n\nLast week, it bought a 49 per cent stake from German utility RWE in the UK’s £11bn Dogger Bank South project. It also agreed in July to acquire a 49 per cent stake in an Iberdrola 476MW offshore wind farm in the Baltic Sea, worth €1.6bn.\n\n“When we take 49 per cent, it’s a clear signal that Masdar is becoming a developer, we’re going to share development risk and deploy people alongside Iberdrola and co-develop the projects,” said Al Meer. “We’d like to go to 50 . . . or even take 100 per cent of projects.”\n\n“They have been buying other assets elsewhere but they’re definitely keen on the UK,” said Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Bernstein. “Maybe because of the COP presidency, there’s more willingness on the part of the UAE to push more money in now.”\n\nThe Iberdrola agreements form part of up to €15bn in funding that Masdar and the Spanish group have agreed to mobilise at COP to back renewable energy projects.\n\n“By combining our renewables experience and financial strength with those of Masdar, we can deliver more secure, competitive and clean energy quicker,” said Ignacio Galán, Iberdrola’s executive chair.\n\nAdditional reporting by David Sheppard in London",

    "body": "Vladimir Putin is set to visit both Saudi Arabia and the UAE on Wednesday, the first time he has travelled to the region since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced the working visits on Tuesday, saying that “the parties will discuss bilateral relations and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict”.\n\nSaudi Arabia is Russia’s key partner in Opec+, while the UAE has become the main international hub for Russian businesses and a significant route for circumventing western sanctions.\n\nPutin enjoys close relations with both the oil-exporting Gulf states, which have remained neutral in the Ukraine conflict. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have not ratified the statute that governs the International Criminal Court, which has indicted the Russian president for alleged war crimes.\n\nMohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, ruler of the UAE, have developed personal relationships with Putin and touted themselves as interlocutors between Russia and the west.\n\nPrince Mohammed and Sheikh Mohammed have been central to various mediation efforts relating to the Ukraine war, including prisoner swaps.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s economic partnership with Russia has been most strongly felt in the oil market. Prince Mohammed played a crucial role in helping bring Moscow into a broader Opec+ grouping, which last week expanded and deepened output cuts.\n\nMoscow’s relationship with the region was underlined last month when the US imposed sanctions on three UAE-based shipowners, accusing them of exporting Russian crude oil priced above a $60-per-barrel cap imposed by the G7 and Australia.\n\nWashington’s move highlighted the increased western efforts to clamp down on sanctions circumvention, after the Financial Times reported that in October, almost all of Russian oil traded above the G7 price cap.\n\nPutin will on Thursday host President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran, an important ally and provider of military equipment such as drones for his forces in Ukraine. Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been regional rivals, although the two signed a China-brokered deal this year to restore diplomatic relations.\n\nSince ordering the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin has limited his travels to countries of the former Soviet Union, as well as China and Iran.\n\nAndrey Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that, aside from their practical value, the visits were a way for Putin to show that Russia was not in international isolation.\n\n“It’s both a message to the elites — that these regions are now fields for engagement and a way to reassure the population that Russia is not isolated from the outside world.”",

    "body": "Scores of major companies have flocked to Expo City on the outskirts of Dubai for the world’s biggest UN climate summit, to rub shoulders with some of the near-200 governments and tout their business.\n\nThe attendance of prominent bank and energy bosses has risen, including the first-time visit by ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods, but the leaders of a host of other enterprises are also present for the first time after the COP28 agenda was expanded for health, food, water and nature.\n\nSpeaking from Dubai, Reckitt chief executive Kris Licht said he was “delighted” that health had finally been given a formal place on the agenda. Reckitt came to prominence at COP26 in Glasgow, where it supplied its Dettol disinfectant to the organisers in the middle of the pandemic.\n\n“By collaborating to unpack how climate impacts health and how healthcare impacts the climate, we can find solutions to both problems,” he said, about the event that has also drawn drug companies such as AstraZeneca.\n\nFrom the oil and gas industry, UAE guests included Oxy chief executive Vicki Hollub, ENI head Claudio Descalzi and German energy group RWE’s Markus Krebber.\n\nBut the wider range of corporate attendees this year includes EY chief executive Carmine di Sibio, Microsoft president Brad Smith, Lloyd’s of London boss John Neal, and Volvo deputy chief executive Javier Varela.\n\n“Business has an integral role to play in both finding and implementing the solutions to climate change,” said Varela.\n\nHe added that COP28 was “an invaluable opportunity” for Volvo, which has begun sourcing “green” steel for its vehicles. It was a chance “to listen and learn from other companies and experts that like us” believe that limiting global warming to “1.5C above pre-industrial levels is a limit rather than just another target.”\n\nPower company bosses were also well-represented as talks took place about the shift from coal and methane emission cuts, bringing French group’s Engie’s chair Jean-Pierre Clamadieu and chief executive Catherine McGregor, as well as NextEra’s Rebecca Kujawa.\n\nBobby Banerjee, professor of management at Bayes Business School at City University in London, said oil and gas companies had been attending the COP for years despite being on the sidelines of the agenda. “But it’s become a lot slicker now,” he said, likening it to a “trade show”.\n\nIn many cases, he says, the “real stuff” happens away from the official climate negotiations at the COP, with businesses meeting each other or with officials from countries or states.\n\n“What really happens is the backroom deals,” he says. “They have these side events. That’s where you will find the oil companies talking about [technology like] carbon capture and storage.”\n\nFor smaller businesses or those with interesting technology, the COP was a big opportunity to showcase their products, he said.\n\nThe cohort of senior bankers at the summit has also swelled, as finance for climate-related projects moves into the front lines, growing since Glasgow’s COP26 when the financial alliance was launched with Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan and Standard Chartered’s Bill Winters.\n\nSteven van Rijswijk, chief executive of ING, who is also in Dubai, said the Dutch bank was keen to be part of the financing of the energy transition.\n\n“[COP] is always the place where all relevant players come together, so it is good to be there too, to be part of the conversation, to hear what the developments are, what everyone thinks about it and to make clear what we can contribute and what we expect,” Rijswijk said.\n\nBut Paul Morgenthaler, managing partner at venture capital group CommerzVentures, says COP is little more than “a business conference where oil deals are struck”.\n\nConcerns about the fossil fuel industry’s roles at the summit have been amplified this year, because host country the United Arab Emirates is one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers. COP28 president Sultan al-Jaber is also the boss of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.\n\nThe UAE has been linked to about $200bn in deals, largely in green energy, in the run-up to COP28, according to Financial Times analysis. At the start of the summit, it announced a £30bn climate-focused investment vehicle, working with asset managers including Brookfield and BlackRock. Both Brookfield’s Connor Teskey and BlackRock’s Larry Fink were in Dubai.\n\nThe size of the COPs has ballooned in recent years, with registered attendees upwards of 80,000 not including a large support staff at the venue.\n\nSome have called for COP to be slimmed down, refocusing on the climate negotiations. Morgenthaler believes the present format has “proven ineffective at addressing the challenge we are up against”.\n\nOthers, including Jaber, argue the business world should be at the annual climate summit, because it has a chief role in shifting economies to become greener.\n\nThe private sector will need to provide trillions of dollars in financing for the shift to greener economies if the world is to meet its goals of limiting global temperature rises.\n\nLloyd’s Neal said he would welcome an agreement between countries on whether to phase out fossil fuels as this would provide more “certainty” to the business world. The leading insurance market sent Neal along with its chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown.\n\n“They’re going to have that conversation at some point, so why not have it now?” he said, describing the climate transition as “the biggest single opportunity we will have ever seen”.\n\nAcknowledging that Lloyd’s does not require its own members to stop underwriting new oil and gas projects, he said this type of decision was best left to politicians and negotiators.\n\n“I don’t think the private sector should say ‘we will stop insuring fossil fuels in 2035’. That’s for governments to determine.”\n\n“In a strange sort of way, it’s trying to get the government and leadership to think, ‘why don’t you just get in front of the story?’” he added. “Because you’ve got a private sector that will help with the financing, help with the transition.”\n\nBanerjee said that businesses play a role in influencing whatever agreement countries reach.\n\n“The COP people love to say: ‘Oh look, a small country can veto an agreement’. Sure they can. But those agreements are pointless because the real deals are happening somewhere else.”\n\nHe added: “There is a geopolitics, but the geopolitics is always being influenced by big business.”\n\n",

Total attendance in Dubai is unconfirmed but estimated at about 80,000, based on the list.\n\nThe roster of chief executives on the UAE guest list included interim BP chief executive Murray Auchincloss, BlackRock’s Larry Fink, commodity trading group Trafigura’s Jeremy Weir and Brookfield Asset Management’s Connor Teskey. BlackRock and Brookfield were involved in the $30bn fund launched by the UAE on Friday to invest in climate-related projects.\n\nBankers were one of the most represented professions among badge holders invited by the UAE, as climate finance moves to the forefront.\n\nHSBC’s Noel Quinn arrived on the first day, with more than two dozen staff from various entities attending as part of the UAE group and another 46 invited by other Asian nation delegations.\n\nHSBC said it had “participated in previous COPs and will engage at COP28 in support of the ambition to drive climate action and contribute to the efforts to finance the net zero transition”.\n\nCitigroup listed 26 staff, with Bank of America sending 18 as UAE guests, with its presence led by chief executive Brian Moynihan.

Standard Chartered chief executive Bill Winters and Deutsche Bank’s Christian Sewing and Lazard’s Peter Orszag were among the other prominent bankers to make the UAE list.\n\n“This COP is even more of a trade show than we saw in Glasgow and Sharm el-Sheikh [in 2021 and 2022],” said Alex Scott, climate diplomacy and geopolitics lead at the climate-focused think-tank E3G. “I don’t expect these bankers are here to sit in on hours of climate negotiation.”\n\nFrom the oil and gas sector, the UAE guests included a sizeable contingent of 17 Abu Dhabi National Oil Company staff, led by the COP28 president Sultan al-Jaber, who has battled criticism of his dual conflicting roles. The UAE renewable energy giant Masdar also had more than 70 staff on hand.\n\nOxy chief executive Vicki Hollub, ENI head Claudio Descalzi and German energy group RWE’s Markus Krebber were among the other sector leaders.\n\nEnergy executives were also well represented on the smaller delegation lists of other countries, including from Brazil, which itself brought about 3,000 people in all. By comparison the US delegation was about 800.\n\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is among the more prominent country leaders attending, as well as India’s Narendra Modi, in the absence of the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies, Joe Biden and Xi Jinping.\n\nThe first draft of the so-called global stock take of emissions published on Friday that forms part of the outcome of the COP28 negotiations included the hard fought-over option of a fossil fuel phaseout.\n\nBoth the renewable energy and fossil fuel sector were “at liberty at any other time of year to conduct business”, said Tessa Khan, an international climate change lawyer and campaigner. “At a moment that is so critical, any diversion of energy or focus from a really strong outcome and from the focus on a fossil fuel phaseout in particular is a concern.”\n\nAn army of public relations and strategist specialists were also among the UAE’s guests and delegation, led by 53 Edelman operatives, plus more than 100 other communications staff working for the UAE.\n\nThe consultants were out in force, with Boston Consulting Group allocating 62 staff to the UAE team in its advisory role, as well as making experts available on issues including renewable energy and finance.\n\nThe disclosures were made as part of a promise of greater transparency by the UN, after more than 630 lobbyists for fossil fuel interests were found to be registered at COP27 at Sharm el-Shekih in Egypt.\n\nThe UAE COP28 team said: “We welcome this new measure from UNFCCC which encourages greater openness and transparency.”\n\nThe UAE was one of only two countries to nominate housekeeping staff, nearly all registered with the office of Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak, whose son Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan is president of the UAE.\n\nKnown as the “mother of the nation”, her office nominated 17 housekeepers to attend the Blue Zone, with another housekeeper listed as support staff to the UAE delegation, and two cleaners for the office of Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Azerbaijan’s delegation also nominated two cleaners.",

    "date": "2023-11-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK is to probe Abu Dhabi-backed RedBird IMI’s offer to take over the Telegraph Media Group, a decision fuelling further uncertainty over the ownership of the right-leaning national newspaper in the run-up to the next general election.\n\nCulture secretary Lucy Frazer said on Thursday that the transfer of ownership of the shares to RedBird IMI would be scrutinised using a Public Interest Intervention Notice to start an investigation by Ofcom, the media regulator, and by the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nShe said her decision was based on the need for “accurate presentation of news and free expression of opinion in newspapers”, with both the CMA and Ofcom asked to report back by January 26 2024.\n\nThe decision is throwing uncertainty into a complex process to determine who will succeed the Barclay family as owners of the Telegraph and sister publication the Spectator, which were put into receivership by Lloyds Banking Group last summer.\n\nBut the decision is not a complete setback for RedBird IMI. The US-based investment company had feared a wider probe into the first part of its proposed deal, whereby the Barclay family would pay back their Lloyds loans with debt funding from Redbird IMI.\n\nThis would enable the family to temporarily take back control of the Telegraph group. RedBird IMI then intends to convert the debt provided to the family into full equity ownership of the group.\n\nFrazer’s decision follows concerns from Conservative MPs over risks to press freedom in the UK from a deal to sell to an investment fund that has the majority of its funding from Abu Dhabi. RedBird IMI is 75 per cent owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan’s International Media Investments but run by former CNN boss Jeff Zucker.\n\nRedBird IMI has promised to preserve the titles’ editorial independence with a separate supervisory board. The existing independent directors appointed by Lloyds, led by Openreach boss Mike McTighe, will be retained to oversee the newspaper during the investigation, as well as to unwind the deal should the regulator rule against the debt to equity deal.\n\nThe bidder has also insisted that its Middle Eastern backers play no role in the management of its assets.\n\nIn an interview, Zucker criticised rival newspapers launching sustained “mud slinging” after the details of his bid emerged, including those that also want to buy the titles.\n\nIf the debt repayment proceeds as planned, Lloyds will recover the full £1.1bn in debt owed by the Barclays, which it has written down in its books.\n\nRedBird IMI is planning to use £600mn of this loan for the purchase of the Telegraph Newspaper Group. Lloyds has already called for the funds to repay the loan, according to people close to the process. Final documents still need to be signed ahead of the weekend, with payment expected on Monday, they said.\n\nThe remaining debt to Lloyds will be repaid by IMI directly and then swapped into a corresponding loan to the Very Group, the financial services and retail group owned by the Barclay family.\n\nThe RedBird IMI offer has short-circuited an auction process to sell the titles, expected to have yielded about £600mn in total.\n\nThe decision by ministers not to intervene to stop the repayment of the debt will be a blow to rival bidders, who had called on the government to scrutinise the entire deal.\n\nOther contenders include hedge fund billionaire Sir Paul Marshall; DMGT, the owner of the Daily Mail; and News Corp, owner of The Times. They are expected to testify against RedBird IMI during the investigation in the hope that the deal will be blocked.\n\n",

    "body": "The United Arab Emirates is preparing to launch a $30bn climate-related investment fund with BlackRock, TPG and Brookfield, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe launch comes as the UAE attempts to bolster its credentials as host of COP28 on the first days of the UN summit.\n\nLunate Capital, a new Abu Dhabi-based asset manager set up with $50bn in assets, will oversee the fund with at least $5bn earmarked for investment in Global South countries, three people involved in discussions said.\n\nThe UAE is drawing on vast resources amassed as one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers. The nation sits on assets worth $2.5tn across its sovereign wealth fund, pension funds and central bank, according to data provider Global SWF.\n\nCOP28 president Sultan al-Jaber has repeatedly said climate finance would be a key focus for the summit, which kicked off on Thursday in Dubai. Tens of thousands of delegates and up to 180 heads of state or government are expected to attend the event in Expo City over the next two weeks.\n\nThe Financial Times reported this week that the UAE was putting together a multibillion-dollar investment pot. The country has been linked to almost $200bn in investments this year, largely in green energy, according to FT analysis.\n\nThe UAE has come under scrutiny since being chosen as the COP28 host a year ago over questions on whether one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers should oversee global climate negotiations.\n\nOne leading figure in climate finance called the investment fund a “serious amount” aimed at positioning the UAE as a global centre for climate finance.\n\nCountries, especially in the developing world, are struggling to find the cash to shift their energy systems and economies from fossil fuels to green sources of power. There is also a shortfall in cash to adapt the world’s economies for hotter temperatures.\n\nUN research in 2021 found that $125tn of climate investment would be needed by 2050 if the world was to slash its emissions and meet its Paris agreement goals. The International Energy Agency has said $4.5tn will be needed each year for clean energy alone by the early 2030s, up from $1.8tn now.\n\nIn recent years there has been a big focus on reforming the IMF, World Bank and other multilateral development banks to divert more money to climate change, but there are also growing calls for the private sector to work with public finance to invest in green projects.\n\nLunate was launched earlier this year under the patronage of UAE national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a brother of the Gulf state’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. Lunate is owned by Chimera Investment and its senior management.\n\nIn September, Lunate said Khalifa Al Suwaidi, head of Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, would be one of three managing partners, along with Murtaza Hussain, chief investment officer at Abu Dhabi wealth fund ADQ, and private investment company Chimera chief executive Seif Fikry.\n\nBrookfield, BlackRock and TPG declined to comment. COP28 representatives also declined to comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Kenza Bryan and Antoine Gara\n\n",

    "date": "2023-11-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has promised to allow a “peaceful assembly” and “expression of views” at the “inclusive” UN climate summit over the next fortnight, despite international advocacy groups’ concerns about the Gulf monarchy’s restrictive laws leading to detentions outside the venue.\n\nThe issues of free speech and freedom of movement have been raised by human rights advocacy groups based on the legal framework in the UAE, which limits expression and bans protests.\n\nThousands of participants from civil society are expected to attend, alongside the government and corporate delegations, that may test the UAE authorities.\n\n“Participants are encouraged to share positive and constructive solutions to address the climate crisis,” a UAE official said. “The UAE looks forward to welcoming diverse voices and perspectives.”\n\nIts approach, aligned with the UN climate change secretariat code of conduct, extended to “designated areas” within the summit’s “blue zone”, where delegates carry out formal conference business, but also the “green zone”, which is open to the public, the official said.\n\nUN law applies in the blue zone, whereas UAE law applies in the green zone, according to the secretariat.\n\nHuman rights groups are concerned that, despite the pledge, the validity of UAE laws in the green zone puts activists at risk of detention for raising sensitive matters, such as the UAE’s dual role as summit host and major fossil fuel exporter, or history of repression, or the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\n“We are deeply concerned for the safety and security of COP28 participants who believe they will be able to freely protest throughout the conference,” said Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia and UAE researcher for Human Rights Watch.\n\nAt the previous UN COP27 in Egypt, demonstrations were restricted to UN territory inside the conference centre, where a subdued protest march took place on a central avenue.\n\nWestern officials have been working with Emirati counterparts regarding their response to protests that may occur outside the dedicated zones at the COP28 site.\n\nThis includes how police and security forces will react to direct-action groups, whose activists elsewhere have disrupted traffic and attacked works of art to raise consciousness of climate issues.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests could also erupt in response to the strikes against Gaza by Israel. The UAE normalised diplomatic relations in 2020 with the Jewish state.\n\nActivists were preparing several public expressions of solidarity with Palestine during the summit, said HRW’s Shea. “We are very concerned as to how these will be dealt with,” she said.\n\nIn August, the COP28 organisers and the UN secretariat signed a bilateral deal outlining the legal basis for the holding of COP28 in Dubai. At the time, they said “there will be space available for climate activists to assemble peacefully and make their voices heard”.\n\nRights groups, to no avail, have called for the agreement to be published to clarify the legal conditions under which the summit will take place.\n\nThe UAE criminalises criticism of the state or its leaders or the harming of state interests. “The laws are repressive and not compatible with freedom of association,” said Devin Kenney, Amnesty International’s Gulf researcher, who secured a visa for the event. “Everyone is deeply concerned, myself included.”\n\nHuman rights groups are planning to attend the summit to highlight issues such as climate justice and domestic human rights abuses in the UAE.\n\nOne human rights organisation director, James Lynch, the co-founder of FairSquare, said his visa application for travel to the UAE to attend COP28 was rejected.\n\nHowever, a UAE official said Lynch was “not subject to any restrictions on entering”. The former Amnesty deputy director was stopped from entering the UAE in 2015, when he was scrutinising migrant labour conditions.\n\nAmnesty said the government has rejected all approaches regarding a dialogue on human rights.\n\nAt least 64 Emiratis have been unlawfully jailed because of actual or perceived political opposition, including prominent human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor, it added.\n\n“If the UAE government is serious about its pledge to hold an ‘inclusive’ COP, then it must start by immediately releasing the dozens of Emiratis left languishing in prison simply for expressing their opinions,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary-general.\n\nRights groups are also worried about the use of social media at the summit, based on the criminalisation of criticism of the UAE’s leadership.\n\n“If participants tweet criticism of the Emirati government in the blue zone and then return to their hotel, will they be detained?” said Shea. “There is no clarity on these issues and it is deeply alarming.”\n\nThe UAE was nonetheless preparing to deal with the potential protests in a careful manner, western officials and local observers said.\n\nFormer police officers from western democracies have been hired to consult on policing requirements for the summit, including sensitivity training for demonstrations, said an official.\n\n“They will let everything go inside the summit,” said one local observer. “But outside, that is a different matter.”",

    "body": "Sultan al-Jaber, president-designate of the UN COP28 climate summit and head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, launched a staunch defence against allegations that he used the United Arab Emirates’ position as host of the global event to discuss oil and gas deals, saying they were “false”.\n\nSpeaking in Dubai with less than a day to go before COP28 starts, Jaber said he had never seen nor used the briefing documents obtained by the non-profit Centre for Climate Reporting alongside the BBC, which outlined talking points for the COP president-designate to discuss possible fossil fuel deals with 15 countries including China, Brazil, Germany and Egypt.\n\n“These allegations are false, not true, incorrect and not accurate. It is an attempt to undermine the work of the COP28 presidency,” Jaber told a media briefing at the Dubai Expo City venue for the UN climate summit.\n\n“I promise you, never ever did I see these talking points that they refer to or that I ever even used such talking points in my discussions,” he said, in response to questions.\n\nThe UAE is one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers and a significant overseas investor, with a vast treasure chest in its sovereign wealth fund.\n\nThe Financial Times reported this week that the UAE had also struck deals worth about $200bn over the past year, including big renewable energy projects, prompting criticisms that it is looking to influence decisions at COP28 reached by the almost 200 countries gathered.\n\n“Do you think the UAE or myself would need the COP or the COP presidency to go and establish business deals or commercial relationships?” Jaber told reporters.\n\nEvery conversation he had conducted with every government or any stakeholders “was centred around one thing only”, he said, and that was how to keep alive a target to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.\n\nBut he acknowledged that he had been called on to “engage” with governments and oil and gas companies. “And sometimes I am told ‘you can’t do that’. We are damned if we do and damned if we don’t,” he added.\n\nTens of thousands of delegates are expected for the two-week summit, with organisers saying up to 180 heads of state or government had registered to attend. The UK’s King Charles will give the opening address on Friday.\n\nThe UAE has come in for intense scrutiny since being chosen as the COP28 host a year ago over questions on whether one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers should oversee global climate negotiations.\n\nEU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra was circumspect in an interview with a small group of reporters on Wednesday. “What is very clear, which is true for UAE . . .[and for] everyone is the whole world is watching,” he said.\n\n“Climate talks should be about one topic only and that is climate,” he added.\n\nUnder the landmark Paris agreement in 2015, countries globally agreed to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C and ideally to 1.5C since pre-industrial times.\n\nThis year’s UN climate summit is expected to include a fierce debate about the future role of fossil fuels, which are the biggest contributor to global warming when burnt.\n\nCountries such as the EU, France and Ireland are pushing for a phaseout of fossil fuels, but others that are reliant on production, including Russia, Saudi Arabia and China, are expected to continue to push back.\n\nLeading UN climate official Simon Stiell said world leaders must set out what “bolder actions” were needed to limit climate change. “COP28 cannot be just a photo op. Leaders must deliver in Dubai,” he said. “COP28 must show a clear agreement to leave fossil fuel dependency behind.”\n\nTeresa Ribera, the Spanish minister responsible for dealing with climate, told the FT that the UN summit would only be a success if there was “an ambitious decision on mitigation”, or how to tackle global warming.\n\n“The energy sector must be predominantly free of fossil fuels ahead of 2050,” Ribera added.\n\nUS climate envoy John Kerry said Washington supported calls for a phaseout of unabated fossil fuels, or those burnt without the emissions captured.\n\n“We all know what the problem is. It is this burning of fossil fuel without abatement,” he said, adding that the US would be calling for much faster action on climate change at the summit. The US remains the world’s biggest oil and gas producer but has strived under the administration of President Joe Biden to shift its economy to green energy through $369bn worth of incentives.\n\n“We’re going to have to move at a much, much faster rate and deploy many more trillions of dollars in order to achieve our goals, and that has to be hammered home every day relentlessly in an effort to get what we need to do to win this battle,” Kerry said.",

    "date": "2023-11-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "By all means block the deal but spare us the sanctimony. A campaign is on to prevent Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, vice-president of the United Arab Emirates, buying a major piece of the British media. That the titles in question, the Daily and Sunday Telegraph and the Spectator, are about the most important publications to the Conservative party is quickening anxiety.\n\nFor all the shifts in the media landscape, newspaper groups, and the rightwing press particularly, still carry an outsize weight in setting the political agenda. So it is not hard to see why the ownership of the Tory house journals — previously home to Boris Johnson’s scratchings — matters to Conservatives, who are making their case with high moral tone. They have a devastatingly simple argument. Sheikh Mansour is a leader of a foreign nation and one that does not believe in freedom of the press.\n\nThe UAE is a valued ally and investor in the UK. But it is not a good place to be a journalist. In the words of Reporters Without Borders (RSF): “As soon as they emit the slightest criticism, journalists and bloggers find themselves in the crosshairs of the UAE’s authorities, who are masters of online surveillance.” They can face prison for “insulting the state or spreading false information”. In RSF’s rankings of press freedom, the UAE stands 145th out of 180.\n\nWhile the Spectator is thriving, the Telegraph (where I worked in the 1990s) is not the institution it was. Once a bastion of serious if somewhat crusty journalism, the title now too often descends into shrill populist paranoia and heated anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nThe would-be buyers are a joint venture of the Sheikh’s IMI and a US private equity firm RedBird Capital. Their supporters argue that IMI is not a UAE state entity — though it comes close — and point to safeguards to protect editorial independence. Redbird will run the titles alone under the vigilant leadership of former CNN president Jeff Zucker. Sheikh Mansour, we are told, will be a passive investor.\n\nYet media history shows how little these defences are worth and it is naive to believe coverage would be allowed to be inimical to the UAE’s interests. As other proprietors have shown, you don’t need to interfere directly as long as you appoint an editor whose views align with yours and who is “sensitive” to your interests. The UAE has many welcome UK investments including Manchester City. But a football club cannot help decide the next Tory leader.\n\nSo yes, those calling for the UK to block the deal under public interest powers are right. For all the assurances, there is a principle here. A state-related entity from a country with no regard for press freedom at home should not own, even passively, a pillar of the British media. (I should note that the Financial Times is part of an employee-owned Japanese media group.)\n\nBut if we are going to have this conversation, let’s spare ourselves the humbug of pretending that existing British media moguls are as hands-off and virtuous as a Disney princess is chaste. Individuals buy newspapers for status or power and invariably use them to advance personal or professional interests. And the roll call of UK press barons is hardly one to shout about.\n\nIn 2015, the Telegraph’s chief political commentator resigned, claiming that the Barclay family, the outgoing owners, were suppressing stories about HSBC because it was an important advertiser. He similarly blamed the title’s relative silence over Hong Kong on a fear of upsetting Chinese interests. The Barclays’ predecessor, Conrad Black, was jailed for fraud in the US. He was later pardoned by Donald Trump.\n\nIf the Redbird IMI deal is blocked, the beneficiary could be the bid led by Sir Paul Marshall, co-owner of GB News, which gives airtime to race-baiters and conspiracy theorists.\n\nRobert Maxwell, the late owner of the Mirror, stole hundreds of millions from the company’s pension fund. A perennial interferer in his papers, he even rigged a “spot the ball” competition to avoid paying out the £1mn prize.\n\nLord Evgeny Lebedev, the current co-owner of the Evening Standard, owes his media empire to the money made by his father, a former KGB officer and Russian oligarch, currently on Canada’s sanctions list. Lebedev, a supporter of Boris Johnson in the London mayoral elections, ennobled by the former prime minister, also part-owns the Independent with a Saudi businessman thought to be close to the regime.\n\nAnd then there is Rupert Murdoch. The tycoon is a genuine newsman who saved the British press from the grip of the print unions. But his political influence is immense and, to many, malign. Aside from that, his stewardship has been replete with scandals. The UK phone-hacking saga, centred on his papers, led to the closure of a title and the jailing of journalists. One of the then editors is now his CEO at News UK. In the US, his Fox News network paid out $787mn to the Dominion voting equipment business for accusing it of being part of a plot to steal the 2020 presidential election, a claim the network knew was untrue.\n\nThese then are some of the existing owners. Viewed against them, the damage the sheikh could do is probably limited. And yet the conservative campaigners are probably right. There is an absolute principle worth defending.\n\nOn that basis the deal should probably be blocked. But let’s not delude ourselves about what counts for a fit and proper owner in the UK.\n\nrobert.shrimsley@ft.com",

    "body": "The United Arab Emirates planned to use meetings about the COP28 climate summit it is hosting later this week to pitch oil and gas deals to foreign governments, according to leaked briefing documents obtained by the non-profit Centre for Climate Reporting alongside the BBC.\n\nSultan al-Jaber, president-designate of this year’s UN climate summit, has called for a “phaseout” of fossil fuels globally. But his position as head of COP28 while also leading the UAE state oil company Adnoc has attracted criticism from politicians in the US and Europe because of the perceived conflict of interest.\n\nDocuments posted online on Monday appear to show plans for Jaber to discuss fossil fuel deals with 15 countries including China, Brazil, Germany and Egypt. The documents have not been verified by the Financial Times. A spokesperson for COP said the documents were “inaccurate”, “unverified” and had not been used by COP28 in meetings.\n\nThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees the summit, did not reply to a request for comment. Its website states that the role of the COP president, who hosts the climate change conference every year, includes “raising ambition to tackle climate change internationally”.\n\nUnder the UNFCCC’s code of conduct, elected and appointed officers should not use their role to seek private gain or advantage, or to represent the interests of other groups. Draft rules of procedure that have not yet been adopted by the COP state that “the president shall participate in the session in that capacity and shall not simultaneously exercise the rights of a representative of a party”.\n\nAmnesty International’s climate adviser Ann Harrison called for Jaber’s resignation as head of COP28. “Documents suggesting he was briefed to advance business interests in COP meetings only fuel our concerns that COP28 has been comprehensively captured by the fossil fuel lobby to serve its vested interests,” she said, adding it looked “ever more like a fox is guarding the hen house”.\n\n“The COP presidency is meant to rise above conflicts of interest and should focus instead on making this summit count on the key issues,” Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the landmark Paris agreement, told the FT.\n\nThe success of the climate summit would be judged on the negotiated text, she added, and whether this includes commitments to phase out fossil fuels and accelerate the deployment of renewable energy.\n\nThe US has previously argued that Jaber could play an important role in driving change in the oil industry.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is not planning to go to the summit, US officials said on Sunday, but his top climate advisers, including former secretary of state John Kerry and former White House chief of staff John Podesta, are expected to attend.\n\nSyria’s Prime Minister Hussein Arnous will attend COP28 as head of the country’s delegation, pro-government newspaper Al-Watan reported on Monday. Arnous’ name also appears on a list of speakers for the summit previously published by the UN.\n\nEarlier this year the UAE invited Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad to attend as part of an “inclusive COP process”, and against the backdrop of increasing normalisation of ties between the Syrian government and other Middle Eastern states. It would have been Assad’s first global summit since 2011 featuring western governments who opposed him in Syria’s bloody civil war.\n\nCOP28 is likely to host a fierce debate over emerging economies’ continued reliance on polluting fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas.\n\nAlmost 200 countries committed at COP26 in 2021 in Glasgow to “phase down” — rather than “phase out” — coal power, but use of the fossil fuel has barely declined, especially as energy demand expands in countries including China, India and Indonesia.\n\nBiden’s likely absence from COP28 had been expected as he grapples with war in the Middle East and prepares for a re-election campaign in 2024.\n\nBut the apparent decision to skip the gathering of world leaders is still striking given that Biden has placed the fight against climate change high on his domestic and international agendas and attended the last two climate summits in the UK and Egypt.\n\nThe White House said on Monday: “Since day one, President Biden has led and delivered on the most ambitious climate agenda in history, both at home and abroad. He secured the largest climate investment ever, putting the US on a path to cut climate pollution in half by 2030, protected more than 21mn acres of public lands and waters, and he continues to rally world leaders to raise their collective climate ambition.”\n\nPope Francis, who is 86, said at the weekend that he still planned to attend COP28 in person despite suffering from a lung inflammation that stopped him from delivering his usual Sunday blessing in person from St Peter’s Square in Rome.",

    "body": "The writer is chair of The Elders and former president of Ireland\n\nThis year will go down in history as the one when global temperature records were not merely surpassed but shattered. There is also a risk that 2023 becomes the year that multilateral co-operation on climate fractures, if leaders do not respond at the scale and with the urgency the science demands. As COP28 starts in Dubai against a backdrop of divisive geopolitics, governments need to demonstrate that working together on our shared challenges is not only necessary but possible.\n\nThe need for collective action is urgent, and the cost of inaction catastrophic. Yet leaders have not done enough. We are well off-track in curbing global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the limit set out in the Paris Agreement. The latest UN assessment shows current climate policies would mean a predicted 9 per cent rise in global emissions from 2010 to 2030, despite scientific consensus demanding a 45 per cent reduction in the same timeframe. Meanwhile, despite projections of global clean energy investments reaching $1.7tn in 2023, oil and gas industry profits soared to an estimated $4tn last year while fossil fuel subsidies hit a record $7tn.\n\nCOP28 will unfold amid intersecting crises: the horror in Israel and Gaza, Russia’s war on Ukraine and the cost of living crisis are all at the forefront of international concern. However, global stability is inextricably linked with addressing the many other grave challenges that humanity faces, not least the climate crisis.\n\nCOP28 presents a pivotal moment for the United Arab Emirates, as it steers these critical negotiations regarding our shared future. The UAE presidency is not without controversy, given the country’s domestic plans to expand fossil fuel production. But if it rises to the occasion with bold leadership, it could convince other major fossil fuel stakeholders to deliver a robust COP28 outcome with enhanced commitments.\n\nThe summit’s president, Sultan al-Jaber, has acknowledged the inevitability of a global transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. Given his position as the chief executive of the national oil company, he is uniquely placed to chart a path forward — but this cannot be with a slow phase down of fossil fuels. Instead we need a phase out with clear timelines. While a commitment to triple investments in clean energy by 2030 could be significant, the mantle of leadership at COP28 demands more. It is incumbent upon the presidency to raise ambition for an outcome that speaks to the urgency we face.\n\nThe burden of delivering a successful COP28 also extends to all governments, particularly those of nations historically responsible for generating most emissions. I am deeply troubled by some domestic policy reversals undermining progress — from tax cuts sparking an increase in emissions in Sweden, to the UK’s new North Sea oil and gas pledges, to the continuing oil and gas expansion in both Brazil and Norway — all moves that contradict their public commitments. While the US Inflation Reduction Act marks a major step forward, the surge in oil drilling permits under President Joe Biden — surpassing those of his predecessor — is worrying. Such inconsistency is untenable; leaders must align domestic policy with the reality of the climate emergency.\n\nRich countries need to get into crisis mode, spearheading efforts to drastically curb their own emissions and build resilience, while providing support to the least economically developed nations. Leaders must boost climate finance well beyond the promised $100bn mark, aiming for the trillions now necessary. We need to see the development of new mechanisms, including targeting industries reaping huge profits from climate change.\n\nWe cannot afford to press pause on action, or to have a “bad COP”. Amid a global landscape rife with division, the success of this summit is critical — not just for the climate, but for upholding the spirit of multilateral co-operation between countries.\n\n",

    "date": "2023-11-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sir Christopher Hohn’s activist hedge fund TCI has opened an office in Abu Dhabi, joining a wave of groups betting that the United Arab Emirates will help power the industry’s growth.\n\nThe firm, which manages $60bn, said it will use the office to forge ties with local investors and expand its assets under management. Bronwyn Owen, the group’s head of investors relations, is relocating from New York to run the office.\n\nThe UAE has in recent years become a hedge fund hotspot, drawing the likes of Izzy Englander’s Millennium, Steve Cohen’s Point 72, quant investing firm AQR and macro fund Brevan Howard.\n\nIndustry executives say that having an office in the region has become increasingly important to winning local business and building ties with major sovereign wealth funds.\n\n“The Middle East is a vital market for the investment management industry, both from a talent and asset growth perspective, as well as a critical partner in global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and climate change,” Hohn said on Thursday.\n\nHedge funds have so far favoured Dubai over Abu Dhabi but the latter has started to gain traction. Brevan Howard set up an office in Abu Dhabi this year, with co-founder Trifon Natsis and chief compliance officer Ryan Taylor both relocating to the city. The fund plans to have more than 100 staff there next year, and has already hired about 50, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nExecutives and traders say the absence of personal income tax in the UAE has also strengthened its hand as hedge funds consider expansion plans beyond the traditional financial hubs of London and New York.\n\nTCI, which has offices in both New York and London, did not clarify whether it would transfer additional existing staff to Abu Dhabi.\n\nHohn has built a reputation as one of the most fearsome activist hedge funds, pushing for changes in corporate strategy or the replacement of management.\n\nIn the past year, TCI has campaigned for the removal of three board members at Spanish telecoms company Cellnex and put pressure on plane maker Airbus to drop a plan to purchase a unit of French IT company Atos.\n\nThe hedge fund’s decision to establish a base in the Gulf state comes as the UAE prepares to host the UN’s COP28 climate summit. TCI has in recent years sought to put pressure on companies to disclose their carbon emissions.\n\nTCI said that having an office in the UAE will help it continue with “its efforts catalysing climate action within the private finance sector”.\n\nHohn said that he planned to use the new office in Abu Dhabi to help with additional philanthropic work. Hohn is the chair of a foundation linked to the hedge fund which gives money to charitable causes including improving children’s health, helping countries cope with the effects of climate change and promoting reproductive health and rights.",

    "blurb": "Pieces featuring Arabic or Hindi numerals, reflecting the region’s cultures, are gaining in popularity with collectors",
    "date": "2023-11-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Collectors visiting the biennial Dubai Watch Week, the sixth edition of which is on now, have come to anticipate not just another horological get-together, but also the release of special limited edition watches that reflect the culture of the region.\n\nEstablishing a fresh market for contemporary watches with dials featuring Hindi numerals has primarily been the achievement of Mohammed Seddiqi, chief commercial officer of Dubai-based Ahmed Seddiqi & Sons, the largest watch retailer in the United Arab Emirates and the wider region.\n\nToday, the UAE is one of the most dynamic markets for watches. According to figures from the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, Swiss exports to the UAE for January to September are up 11.5 per cent year on year, and up 29.4 per cent when compared with the same period in 2021.\n\nThere has long been an active collector market for vintage watches with what Christie’s Geneva head Remi Guillemin calls “Arabic dials” — in particular, those with the Khanjar national symbol of Oman and the UAE national crest with the signature of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai.\n\n“What’s interesting is that these collectors are not necessarily from the region,” says Guillemin. “We have interest in [these watches] from clients from Australia to the US. Their continued appeal lies in the fact that they are extremely rare and represent a certain moment in the history of this region.”\n\nSeddiqi’s efforts to kick-start a market for modern regional edition watches started over a decade ago. “My father had a white gold day-date with Hindi numerals and, in 2012, we started using the Hindi numerals with Hublot when we did the Vision in titanium and rose gold,” he says.\n\nSales of the initial limited edition of 100 pieces with Hublot were so swift that they inspired others. “It was an inspiration for a lot of the watch industry to come back with the Indian numerals. Many brands have implemented Hindi numerals specifically for the Middle East market and we see that demand worldwide has increased.”\n\nAs for the special editions launched at this year’s Dubai Watch Week, Seddiqi says everything was pre-sold before the event started.\n\nFrédéric Arnault, chief executive of Tag Heuer — which has just presented a limited-edition Dubai tourbillon — feels that “showing respect to local culture” stimulates interest and yields new customers. On the secondary market, Arnault has noticed those particular special edition watches attracting a minimum 30 per cent premium over their retail price.\n\nOne of the most sought-after Hindi or eastern Arabic numeral-dial watches is the platinum Rolex Daytona. According to Remy Julia, head of watches for auction house Christie’s in Dubai, the secondary market price of a regular platinum Daytona is $80,000-$90,000, whereas the Hindi-numeral version is $140,000-$150,000. “This has dropped from about $250,000, but I think it is going to go back up,” he predicts.\n\nBig brands are not the only ones benefiting from this regional specificity. Last month, a Moritz Grossmann in steel with eastern Arabic numerals sold via Christie’s for $37,800 against a presale estimate of $10,000-$20,000. This sale, says Julia, “educated us on the brand and its level of watchmaking, its attractiveness, and the level of interest with multiple clients”. He adds that, for small brands, these local editions provide “a platform with resonance that they would never usually be able to afford”.\n\nFor Seddiqi, the popularity of UAE special editions has encouraged him to explore fresh creative avenues with watch brands. One of his favourites was produced by Bovet. “It was a combination of Arabic and Hindi, with the upper numerals in Arabic and the lower numerals in Hindi,” he says. “It was following the trend of what Panerai did with the California dial, but we twisted it a bit to cater to our market. This kind of dial is something close to my heart, something totally new.”\n\nSeddiqi has further broadened the concept this year, with 16 limited UAE edition watches being launched during Dubai Watch Week. Not all have Hindi numerals. “We have two Hublots that do not use the numerals but have Arabic calligraphy on the dial,” he says. “We commissioned a calligrapher in Dubai and talked to Hublot about having his artwork in the dial. The calligraphy is in different colours and is also Super-Luminova, so it glows in the dark.\n\n“Then, with the Hindi numerals, we’re doing a Breitling GMT. It will feature Hindi numerals on a nice electric-blue dial. And we changed the name from GMT to DMT — Dubai Mean Time. Today, [with] Dubai being an important city and considered the centre of the world, we thought that we have to highlight Dubai. Maybe the people at Greenwich might be upset,” he says with a laugh.\n\n“But we just thought it would be nice for the people who are visiting Dubai Watch Week to have something that is made specifically for the market.”",

    "body": "Middle Eastern airlines placed orders worth tens of billions of dollars for more than 100 passenger jets on the opening day of the Dubai air show, underscoring the rebound in the aviation industry even as regional tensions run high.\n\nEmirates, the Dubai-based carrier, placed an order for 90 of Boeing’s 777X aircraft, the world’s largest twin-engined passenger jet, valued at $52bn at list prices.\n\nIts low-cost sister airline, Flydubai, followed up with an order for 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, which would be the first widebody aircraft in its fleet, worth $11bn at list prices. The US aircraft maker also picked up a commitment from Royal Jordanian for its 787 jet.\n\nThe flood of orders comes despite concerns over a fall in demand for air travel in the region due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nBookings for flights to the Middle East fell in the three weeks following the Hamas attacks on Israel, dropping from 13 per cent above 2019 levels to 13 per cent below, according to industry data provider ForwardKeys.\n\nSales for flights from the region fell 10 percentage points.\n\nYet demand for the industry’s biggest jets is soaring after a prolonged downturn following the coronavirus pandemic, which severely dented long-haul travel.\n\nMuch of the demand is expected to be driven by Middle Eastern airlines over the next two decades. Boeing is forecasting that wide-body aeroplanes for long-haul travel will make up 45 per cent of deliveries to the region over the next 20 years — the highest regional percentage worldwide — as it expands into an international transit hub.\n\nThe US group projects delivery of 3,025 new commercial aircraft in the Middle East by 2042, including 1,350 wide bodies.\n\n“The big Gulf carriers continue to believe strongly in the superconnector model and therefore anticipate some growth,” said Edmond Rose, an aviation consultant who works in the region.\n\n“If you believe there is going to be growth in air travel because of global economic expansion then those Gulf carriers are still going to be well placed to pick up some of that.”\n\nMiddle Eastern airlines are forecast to grow over the next two years, and reach 115 per cent of pre-pandemic capacity by 2025, a stronger recovery than any other region, according to the International Air Transport Association, a trade body.\n\nRegional profitability is forecast at $9.41 net profit per passenger this year, in line with the US and more than double that of European carriers.\n\nBeyond the Middle East, Boeing won an order for 90 of its narrow-body 737 Max jets from Turkey’s SunExpress, while European rival Airbus reached an agreement in principle with Turkish Airlines for what it said was a “significant commercial aircraft order”, understood to be for as many as 355 jets.\n\nAirbus also agreed a follow-on order for 30 of its A220-300s single-aisle jets with Latvian carrier airBaltic.\n\nIndustry analysts said they expected more orders to come at Dubai this week as airlines jostle to lock in delivery slots from both Boeing and Airbus.\n\nAirlines are having to replace older aircraft in their fleets as well as place orders to support future growth, said Stuart Hatcher, chief economist at consultancy IBA, who predicted significant deals at the show.\n\nOrder backlogs for the two plane makers are at record highs, totalling more than 13,900 aircraft to the end of October, according to data from Cirium, the aviation consultancy.\n\n“I am not sure where the [manufacturers] are finding slots for these and I suspect there is a significant amount of slot double booking going on as [they] gamble on some customers seeking to rearrange delivery slots, perhaps in 2026 and later,” said Rob Morris, head of Cirium’s consultancy business Ascend.\n\nAdditional reporting by Claire Bushey in Chicago\n\n",

    "body": "The United Arab Emirates is poised to be removed from the global financial crime watchdog’s “grey list” after making progress on compliance measures to combat money laundering while Panama has gone one step further and been dropped from the index.\n\nThe Paris-based Financial Action Task Force said on Friday that the UAE, the Gulf’s leading financial hub, had “substantially” introduced compliance measures needed for its removal from the multilateral body’s list of countries under enhanced monitoring.\n\nFaft said the UAE had made progress in areas such as facilitating money-laundering investigations, imposing sanctions on non-compliance at financial institutions, and increasing prosecutions. The task force said it would therefore conduct on-site visits to verify that these changes would be sustained.\n\nA successful inspection would provide a signal that the UAE, along with other jurisdictions such as Barbados, Gibraltar and Uganda, could be removed from the list at an upcoming plenary session in February.\n\nOn Friday Panama became one of several jurisdictions, including Albania, Jordan and the Cayman Islands, a British Overseas Territory, to be removed from the grey list altogether after their on-site visits proved successful.\n\nThis was good news for Panama’s beleaguered government, which has been trying to change its reputation as a haven for shady money by touting its green credentials similar to neighbouring Costa Rica.\n\nPanama hit global headlines in 2016 when a local law firm’s documents were leaked detailing how the country facilitated the offshore tax strategies of the global elite.\n\nBeing placed on the grey list last year also tarnished the reputation of the UAE, the leading choice for global financial firms seeking a base in the oil-rich region.\n\nIts inclusion coincided with the war in Ukraine, which triggered an influx of Russian money seeking to avoid western sanctions and intensified scrutiny of the country’s financial compliance regime.\n\nMany Russians have faced difficulties in setting up bank accounts, given the increasing reluctance of compliance teams to deal with clients linked to the country. The UAE earlier this year removed a newly granted license from Russian lender MTS after the US and UK sanctioned the bank.\n\nMany Russians have been forced to rely on informal exchange or cryptocurrencies to move money into the UAE, helping to stoke sky-high demand and driving up real estate valuations.\n\nSome richer Russians have found it easier to open accounts because lenders are willing to engage in the extra due diligence required to take on riskier clients. Sanctioned oligarchs have also moved high-profile assets into the UAE, such as yachts and private jets.\n\nBut the Gulf state, which has taken a neutral stance in the Ukraine war, has said it prevents money flows from sanctioned individuals and does not discriminate against non-sanctioned Russians.\n\nAdditional reporting by Marton Dunai",

A fragile truce between the Arab coalition and the Yemeni rebels has been holding since April 2022, and a Houthi delegation visited Riyadh last week for talks with Saudi officials.\n\nIt was the first official rebel delegation to visit Saudi Arabia since the war erupted and, after five days of talks, Riyadh said it “welcomed the positive results of the serious discussions regarding reaching a road map to support the peace path in Yemen”.\n\nBut after the deaths of the Bahraini soldiers, brigadier general Turki al-Maliki, the Saudi coalition spokesman, described the attack as “a treacherous act of aggression”.\n\nHe said it was carried out by “some elements of the Houthis”, adding that over the past month an electricity distribution plant and a police station had also been targeted in the Saudi border region.\n\nMaliki warned that the acts of “repeated provocation don’t conform with the positive efforts that are being expended to end the crisis and reach a comprehensive political solution”.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, one of the key members of the coalition, said the attack represented “a disregard for all international laws and norms” and required “a deterrent response”.\n\nThe Houthis control most of Yemen’s populous north, while Yemeni factions backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE control the south.\n\nThe conflict has triggered what the UN has described as the world’s worst man-made humanitarian crisis, with estimates that more than 300,000 people have died because of fighting, famine and disease.\n\nAll the warring parties have been accused of abuses, with the coalition condemned for killing thousands of Yemeni civilians in air strikes on Yemen.\n\nBefore the truce was agreed, the Houthis launched regular missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, targeting airports, oil facilities and other infrastructure.\n\nRiyadh has stepped up its efforts to extract itself from the conflict in recent years as it has focused ambitious domestic development plans on areas including the western and southern regions that were targeted by Houthi missiles and drones.\n\nSaudi Arabia has accused Iran of supplying the rebels with increasingly sophisticated missile and drone technology.\n\nBut tensions between Riyadh and Tehran have eased after they agreed in March to restore diplomatic relations as part of an agreement brokered by China.",

    "body": "Trade between Iran and the United Arab Emirates has surged as the Gulf’s commercial capital eased restrictions on business activity between the two neighbours, business people and officials say.\n\nExecutives said the UAE has in recent months rolled back limits on corporate registrations and the issuance of visas to companies from Iran, which remains subject to tough US sanctions. Iranian financiers are also exploring how to enhance bilateral trade by creating financial mechanisms to fund legitimate transactions, they added.\n\nFlourishing trade relations between Iran and the UAE, the traditional centre for re-exports into the Islamic republic, forms part of the Gulf state’s pivot towards regional de-escalation and a focus on business. This comes after a decade of muscular interventionism in the wake of the Arab spring uprisings of 2011.\n\n“UAE foreign policy seems to have shifted toward one that is primarily driven by economic statecraft,” said Afshin Molavi, senior fellow at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in the US, while adding that current and future sanctions on Iran would temper this growth.\n\nUAE diplomatic outreach to Iran since 2019, in response to attacks on international shipping around the Gulf, has been strengthened by the China-brokered breakthrough this year that re-established relations between the Islamic republic and its traditional foe Saudi Arabia. This has helped to ease a decade of cold war-style tensions between the rival Gulf powers.\n\nThe Saudi-Iranian rapprochement has raised hopes that ongoing negotiations could extend into a lasting political settlement. The release of US prisoners held in Iran could also presage talks towards a new — perhaps unofficial — agreement, with Iran to barter a reduction in sanctions for limits on its nuclear activity.\n\nWhile China is Iran’s premier trade partner, the UAE is the second largest. Trade between Iran and the UAE has recovered from a pandemic slump of $11bn in 2020/2021 to $24bn in the 12 months ending in March, according to Iranian data.\n\nThe increase surpasses the $22bn recorded in 2012 before US-led sanctions started to bite. Iranian officials have said they are now targeting a further increase in bilateral trade towards $30bn in the next two years.\n\n“Pressure from the UAE central bank has decreased and some Emirati banks have started opening bank accounts,” said Masoud Daneshmand, a former head of Iran-UAE chamber of commerce. “Currently, some Iranian companies which used to be in the UAE but had become inactive have become active again. Some new companies have also started business.”\n\nIn diplomatic exchanges, Iranian officials have been asking their Emirati counterparts to find new mechanisms for financing trade, according to people briefed on these conversations.\n\nUS sanctions on Iran have created anxiety around Iran-linked transactions because of the risk of US fines. Although the UAE is keen to extend its hand to Iranian business, there are still concerns about provoking a hostile reaction from the US.\n\nMolavi said upcoming elections in the US could also “give pause to UAE investors” because of another potential swing in US policy.\n\n“Our economic relationship with Iran has long been of major importance,” said the UAE’s economy ministry. “The UAE’s trade with Iran is conducted in full compliance with global rules and standards.”\n\nSome Iranian companies and banks have used trustees in the UAE who can act as a proxy for cross-border transactions as a way of sidestepping the current restrictions.\n\n“When goods come from Europe and Canada to Iran’s market, an Emirati pays for them and Iranians pay the Emirati,” said Daneshmand.\n\nSome Iranian banks are now approaching counterparts in the UAE in a bid to formalise the previously grey nature of their business, said a UAE-based businessman.\n\n“For years there’s been self-imposed restrictions on business with Iran, but these have been gradually eased in recent years,” the businessman said. “There’s a sense of more openness.”",

    "body": "An artificial intelligence group with links to Abu Dhabi’s ruling family has launched what it described as the world’s highest-quality Arabic AI software, as the United Arab Emirates pushes ahead with efforts to lead the Gulf’s adoption of generative AI.\n\nThe large language model known as Jais is an open-source, bilingual model available for use by the world’s 400mn-plus Arabic speakers, built on a trove of Arabic and English-language data.\n\nThe model, unveiled on Wednesday, is a collaboration between G42, an AI company chaired by the UAE’s national security adviser, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan; Abu Dhabi’s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI); and Cerebras, an AI company based in California.\n\nThe launch comes as the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been buying up thousands of high-performance Nvidia chips needed for AI software amid a global rush to secure supplies to fuel AI development.\n\nThe UAE previously developed an open-source large language model (LLM), known as Falcon, at the state-owned Technology Innovation Institute in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi, using more than 300 Nvidia chips. Earlier this year, Cerebras signed a $100mn deal to provide nine supercomputers to G42, one of the biggest contracts of its kind for a would-be rival to Nvidia.\n\n“The UAE has been a pioneer in this space (AI), we are ahead of the game, hopefully. We see this as a global race,” said Andrew Jackson, chief executive of Inception, the AI applied research unit of G42, which is backed by private equity giant Silver Lake. “Most LLMs are English-focused. Arabic is one of the largest languages in the world. Why shouldn’t the Arabic-speaking community have an LLM?”\n\nHowever, the Gulf states’ goal of leadership in AI has also raised concerns about potential misuse of the technology by the oil-rich states’ autocratic leaders.\n\nThe most advanced LLMs today, including GPT-4, which powers OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s PaLM behind its Bard chatbot, and Meta’s open-source model LLaMA, all have the ability to understand and generate text in Arabic. However, G42’s Jackson said the Arabic element within existing models, which can work in up to 100 languages, was “heavily diluted”.\n\nJais performs better than Falcon, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA, when benchmarked on its accuracy in Arabic, according to its creators. The developers of Falcon, however, said its software hadn’t been pre-trained in Arabic. Jais has also been designed to have a more accurate understanding of the culture and context of the region, in contrast to most US-centric models, said Professor Timothy Baldwin, acting provost of MBZUAI.\n\nHe added that guardrails had been created to ensure that Jais “does not step outside of reasonable bounds in terms of cultural and religious sensibilities”.\n\nBefore its launch, extensive testing was conducted to weed out “harmful” or “sensitive” content, as well as “offensive or inappropriate output that does not represent the values of the organisations involved in the development of the model”, he added.\n\nNamed after the highest mountain in the UAE, Jais was trained over 21 days on a subset of Cerebras’s Condor Galaxy 1 AI supercomputer by a team in Abu Dhabi. G42 has teamed up with other Abu Dhabi entities as launch partners to use the technology, including Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, wealth fund Mubadala and Etihad Airways.\n\nOne of the challenges in training the model was the lack of high-quality Arabic language data found online, in comparison with English. Jais uses both modern standard Arabic, which is understood across the Middle East, as well as the region’s diverse spoken dialects by drawing on both media, social media and code.\n\n“Jais is clearly better than anything out there in Arabic, and, in English, comparisons show we are competitive or even slightly better across different tasks than existing models,” said Baldwin.",

    "body": "PureHealth has agreed to acquire Circle Health Group of the UK from US company Centene in a deal worth $1.2bn as the United Arab Emirates’ largest healthcare provider extends its international expansion ambitions.\n\nPureHealth is owned by a consortium that includes Abu Dhabi state holding company ADQ and Alpha Dhabi, a listed company that is part of the conglomerate International Holding Company (IHC). They are controlled by the UAE’s powerful national security adviser, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who also chairs the emirate’s main sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.\n\nCircle operates the largest network of private hospitals in the UK with more than 50 sites across the country and about 8,200 employees. It has revenues of about $1.3bn.\n\n“We are confident that it [the acquisition] will position us for continued growth and success,” said Hamad Al Ameri, chief executive of Alpha Dhabi.\n\nThe Circle deal is the latest example of Abu Dhabi’s global acquisition drive as it seeks to deploy excess hydrocarbon revenues into fast-growing sectors that can help diversify its oil-reliant economy.\n\nEarlier this year, PureHealth completed a $500mn investment in Ardent Health Services, the fourth-largest private healthcare group in the US, which operates across six states.\n\nFrom the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to sovereign investment group Mubadala, Abu Dhabi entities have become increasingly active as its economy swung strongly out of the pandemic, with global dealmakers making a beeline to the city’s power brokers as other sources of global capital dry up.\n\nThe IHC family of listed investment vehicles controlled by Sheikh Tahnoon, as well as the government-owned ADQ holding company, have emerged as important players in the UAE’s overseas investment drive.\n\nBut IHC’s meteoric rise from tiny company to regional behemoth has also confused market watchers in the Gulf who have raised concerns about transparency and the blurring of the lines between state and private sector interests. IHC’s net profit grew 181 per cent in 2022.\n\nPureHealth has a network of more than 25 hospitals, as well as laboratories and clinics. Last year, ADQ merged state health operator Seha and insurance provider Daman into PureHealth, forming a national healthcare giant.\n\nFounded in 2004, Circle grew through the acquisition of the larger BMI Healthcare in 2019. Circle pulled out of a landmark deal to manage an NHS hospital in 2015, just three years into a decade-long contract amid performance-related criticism.\n\nThe UAE group will take over Circle’s portfolio, including the UK’s first purpose-built rehabilitation hospital.\n\n“PureHealth, as the region’s largest healthcare group, is well-positioned to make significant contributions to the improvement of healthcare systems and access to world-class medical services in the UAE and beyond,” said Farhan Malik, chief executive of PureHealth.",

    "date": "2023-08-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "The Brics emerging market bloc has launched the biggest expansion in its history as Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were invited to join, in a coup for China’s drive to remake the group into a counterweight to the G7.\n\nThe countries were offered membership alongside Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa from the start of next year in a “new chapter” for the club of developing nations, South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa said at the end of the summit of Brics leaders in Johannesburg.\n\n“We have consensus on the first phase of this expansion process, and further phases will follow,” Ramaphosa said, adding that the Brics would also develop a “partnership model” for other countries.\n\nThe first expansion of the Brics since South Africa joined in 2010 represents a victory for China, which pushed for rapid expansion of the grouping before the summit as part of its ambitions to lead the developing world.\n\nThe inclusion of Iran and Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil producer outside the US, among the first Middle Eastern Brics members also follows Beijing’s brokering of the normalisation of relations between Riyadh and Tehran this year.\n\n“China is playing an agenda-setting role within the Brics grouping” as it competes with the US, said Priyal Singh, senior researcher at South Africa’s Institute for Security Studies. Beijing was “investing more diplomatically, economically and politically in the Brics to serve as a counterweight”.\n\nIndia was more reluctant about expanding Brics, but prime minister Narendra Modi this week signalled his backing for accepting new members. The new nations include some of New Delhi’s own strategic defence partners, such as the UAE and Egypt. “Adding new members will further strengthen Brics and give it a new impetus,” Modi said.\n\nHowever, not every country on the invitation list rushed to join up. Indonesia, the largest south-east Asian economy, declined to submit its interest in joining the Brics, saying it was discussing the possibility of membership internally.\n\nRussia’s Vladimir Putin welcomed the new members and called on the bloc to deepen its economic ties, including creating a common currency. “I want to assure all my colleagues that we will continue what we started — expanding Brics’ influence in the world,” Putin said, appearing via video link from the Kremlin.\n\nThe new members will increase the Brics’ share of global gross domestic product from 32 per cent to 37 per cent on a purchasing power parity basis, Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said.\n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE president, said: “We respect the vision of the Brics leadership and appreciate the inclusion of the UAE as a member to this important group.”\n\nAbdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president, said he looked forward to working with the Brics to “achieve its goals towards strengthening economic co-operation among us and raise the voice of the global south”.\n\nSaudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told Saudi television that the kingdom was awaiting details on “the nature of membership and its components, and based on that and on our internal procedures, we’ll take the appropriate decision”.\n\nAbiy Ahmed, prime minister of Ethiopia, hailed the invitation as a “great moment” for the east African nation, while Argentina’s President Alberto Fernández said joining would “strengthen” his country.\n\nBut Patricia Bullrich, the centre-right coalition’s candidate in Argentina’s upcoming presidential election, said she opposed the move because of Russia’s war in Ukraine. “We believe in an international order based on rules to preserve peace,” she said.\n\nBrics leaders also charged their finance ministers and central bank governors with developing measures to reduce their reliance on the US dollar in trade among their economies, reporting back next year, Ramaphosa said.\n\n“There is a global momentum for the use of local currencies, alternative financial arrangements and alternative payments systems,” he said.\n\nThe commitment to greater use of local currencies fell short of the anti-dollar rhetoric heard before the summit, such as Brazil’s Lula floating the idea of a Brics common currency as a unit of trade.\n\nAdditional reporting by Max Seddon in Riga, Heba Saleh in Cairo, Andres Schipani in Lima, Ciara Nugent in Buenos Aires, Samer Al-Atrush in Dubai and Mercedes Ruehl in Singapore",

    "body": "By the time dozens of top security officials from across the globe touched down in Saudi Arabia to attend a conference on Ukraine this month, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s main task was complete.\n\nAt a similar but smaller gathering in Copenhagen in June, France had asked Riyadh to help pull together a follow-up in the belief that some nations from the so-called global south, including China, would be more comfortable attending if it was organised outside of Europe.\n\nPrince Mohammed duly delivered — personally intervening to help convince Beijing to send a representative, according to diplomats. In all, officials from 42 states, including many that have resisted western pressure to take sides on Russia’s war in Ukraine, attended the gathering in Jeddah.\n\nBy the talks’ end, there were few discernible developments beyond China hinting that it may be willing to take part in future discussions. But for Prince Mohammed the two-day gathering was an undoubted success. It gave the young Saudi royal the perfect stage to project his worldview — one that envisages the kingdom as a rising power whose influence stretches from east to west.\n\nIt is a mindset that reflects the lofty ambitions and soaring confidence of oil-rich Gulf states — buoyed by petrodollar windfalls after last year’s surge in energy prices — that are determined to chart their own courses in an era of polarising, shifting global dynamics.\n\nAt the forefront are the Gulf’s two powerhouses: Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, and the United Arab Emirates, the region’s dominant trade hub, both of whose focus has been increasingly turning eastwards.\n\nWhere others view the shifting global currents through the lens of risk, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi see opportunities as they leverage their financial muscle and abundant oil resources to strategically hedge against their traditional relations with the west.\n\nThe common theme in both Gulf states is one of self-assured, assertive leaders who are no longer willing to accept binary “with us or against us” US demands.\n\nThe UAE’s leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan has for years deployed his small state’s military prowess and financial firepower to ensure it punches above its weight. Equally, Prince Mohammed has been quick to deploy hundreds of billions of dollars in pursuit of grandiose plans to develop his nation, and wants it to be recognised as a top G20 power, economically and diplomatically.\n\nAllies, but also increasingly economic competitors, both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are bent on projecting their standing on the international stage through broader networks as so-called friends with all, and pursuing their own self-interest.\n\nPartly driven by shifting trade patterns but also the result of geopolitics, it is manifesting itself in the diversification of ties with the US — long the dominant foreign power in the Gulf — and deepening relationships with Asian powers, particularly China and India.\n\n“Saudi Arabia and the UAE see more opportunities than risks in this changing world order, and they think they have the policies and instruments to become poles of the emerging multipolar world,” says Emile Hokayem, director of regional security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “They have a very opportunistic, flexible and transactional approach. The time when one could expect full alignment from them is over.”\n\nThe shift in the Gulf has been driven most visibly by trade. China — the region’s biggest trading partner — India and Japan have become the prime buyers of Gulf crude, while US oil imports from the region have declined over the past 15 years following the shale gas boom in North America.\n\nYet relationships with Asian powers have also developed far beyond oil, with the Gulf states thirsty for new technologies across artificial intelligence, energy, logistics and life sciences to support domestic development plans and diversify oil-dependent economies.\n\n“Our ties to established markets are unshakeable,” says a senior Emirati official. But “at the same time, from a macro sense, where is new growth coming from if we look at the next 10, 20 years? It’s coming from big markets in Asia, some in South America, and potentially some African markets.”\n\nBoth the Gulf states have sealed “comprehensive strategic” partnerships with China. When Prince Mohammed hosted Chinese president Xi Jinping in Jeddah for a series of Arab summits in December, he said the gatherings launched a “new historical era” in relations with Beijing, adding that the kingdom was working on “enhancing co-operation to serve international stability”.\n\nA Chinese official tells the FT that Beijing’s relations with the Gulf “are a model for the developing world and for participants in the Belt and Road Initiative”. Describing deepening co-operation on energy, infrastructure, finance, technology, the official says the Gulf and China “can help to build a fairer multilateral order in the Middle East that respects sovereign rights and resists the hegemony of certain powers.”\n\nIt is not just China that the Gulf nations are focusing on. The UAE, home to sovereign investment funds that manage more than $1.3tn, has signed free trade agreements with six nations, including India and Indonesia, in the past 18 months.\n\nWhen Indian prime minister Narendra Modi visited the UAE in July — his fifth visit to the Gulf state in eight years — it was announced that the $850bn Abu Dhabi Investment Authority would establish a presence in Gujarat in the next “few months”. The only overseas office for Adia is in Hong Kong.\n\nThe two Gulf states are also seeking to join Brics, the economies that include China, India, Brazil, Russia and South Africa. Gulf officials say it is a logical move given global trade patterns, but also one that grants them a voice in an important — and welcoming — diplomatic network.\n\n“Any country wants to be consequential, wants to have a seat at the table,” says Anwar Gargash, an adviser to Sheikh Mohammed, speaking about the UAE’s wider ambitions. “We want to build bridges with everyone.”\n\nThe trend has complicated US relations with traditional Arab allies, with divisions becoming more visible in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLike Turkey and Brazil, “they don’t want to have to choose between the United States and China, they don’t want to have to choose a side in the Ukraine war,” says former US diplomat Jeffrey Feltman. “They, in fact, have some benefits to not making a choice, in the same way the United States liked having China and the Soviet Union to be able to leverage one against the other during the cold war.”\n\nAt the Ukraine war’s outset, the UAE rattled the Biden administration by using its temporary seat on the UN Security Council to join China and India in abstaining on a US resolution condemning Moscow, in an extraordinary expression of frustration with American policies.\n\nBoth Abu Dhabi and Riyadh have rebuffed western efforts to cajole them into abandoning Vladimir Putin, with whom they co-operate on oil through Opec+ and consider an important player — and potential spoiler — in the Middle East.\n\nA month before Modi’s visit to Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed was telling the Russian president that he wished to build on the relationship with Moscow.\n\nHe was one of the few global leaders to attend the St Petersburg International Economic Forum which his adviser Gargash describes as a “calculated risk”. The UAE, like Saudi Arabia, offers itself as a mediator between Moscow and the west. “A lot of people would criticise him [for making] the trip,” he adds. “But Sheikh Mohammed was saying ‘I’m here to help in whatever way.’”\n\nFor decades, the Gulf was firmly in the US’s orbit with relationships founded on the unwritten compact that Washington would be their security guarantor while Arab oil producers ensured stable global energy supplies. Saudi Arabia, once a staunch opponent of communism, only recognised China in 1990.\n\nThe UAE in particular actively carved out a role as arguably Washington’s closest Arab ally, taking part in every US-led military coalition since the 1991 Gulf war, bar the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE spent tens of billions of dollars on American military hardware, while investing much of their petrodollar surpluses in US assets.\n\nYet relations grew increasingly fractious after then President Barack Obama was perceived to have ignored Saudi and Emirati interests in the wake of the 2011 Arab uprisings. Ties were further strained by Obama’s decision to sign the 2015 nuclear agreement with their rival, Iran.\n\nThe mood improved after Donald Trump entered the White House and pursued transactional relationships, paid zero attention to rights abuses in the autocratic Gulf and abandoned the nuclear deal.\n\nBut Arab officials became wary of his unpredictability, frustrated by what they considered to be limp responses to attacks on tankers in the Gulf and Saudi oil infrastructure that were blamed on Iran.\n\nHis successor Joe Biden’s decision to shun Prince Mohammed and condemn abuses in the kingdom, particularly the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, then pushed relations with Riyadh to new lows.\n\nLast year, Washington’s sluggish response to missile and drone attacks on Abu Dhabi by Iranian-aligned Yemeni rebels infuriated Sheikh Mohammed, who has not visited the US since 2017, and exposed the absence of personal relationships that were traditionally core to US-Gulf alliances.\n\nTensions have since eased, but there remain points of friction. In May, the UAE pulled out of a US-led maritime task force over frustrations about its rules of engagement after Iranian forces seized two tankers in the Gulf.\n\nYet for all the testiness, all sides acknowledge they need each other. The Biden administration set aside its repugnance for Saudi Arabia’s human rights record to engage Riyadh on issues ranging from energy stability, regional policies and the Ukraine war, culminating in a frosty trip by the president to Jeddah last year. Washington has reassured Abu Dhabi of its commitment to the region’s security after the UAE suspended its participation in the naval task force and dispatched additional warships and fighter jets to the Gulf.\n\nSaudi and Emirati officials also have no illusions about their dependence on the US for their main defence needs. Indeed, their demand is more not less: both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are pushing Washington to agree to more institutionalised security partnerships.\n\nThe discussions with the UAE picked up after last year’s attacks on Abu Dhabi. US talks with Saudi Arabia are part of efforts to cajole the kingdom into normalising relations with Israel and, if successful, could be used by Washington to try and curb elements of Riyadh’s relationship with Beijing, such as military co-operation and technology transfers.\n\nBut Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court, says that while there could be “adjustments” if the US agrees to a security alliance with the kingdom, Riyadh would resist pressure to dilute ties with China.\n\n“There’s no going back. Saudi Arabia will not give up the bridges it has built with the global south, with Russia or China, because those are integral to the functioning of the Saudi economy and to the kingdom’s long term market needs,” he says. “The Saudi leadership is much more independently minded; 10 years ago there was a whole generation that was just instinctively more deferential to American requests.”\n\nThe war in Ukraine has underscored to the Gulf what the US is capable of when committed to a cause. But the question at the core of Emirati and Saudi concerns is the extent of Washington’s commitment to their objectives.\n\n“I don’t think that American economic, military or political power is less formidable today, or will be in the next 10 years, than it was in the last 10 years,” says Gargash. “What I’m trying to understand is what is the commitment to the region and the UAE.”\n\nIt is not just American military hardware that binds the Gulf to the US.\n\nThe Gulf states peg their currencies to the dollar and continue to view the US as a key investment market. More than 40 per cent of Abu Dhabi’s investment fund wealth is deployed in the US. Many of Saudi Arabia’s $650bn Public Investment Fund’s high-profile investments have been in American assets, including stakes in Uber and electronic vehicle maker, Lucid.\n\nOfficials point out that Gulf’s state funds find it much easier to invest in the US than less liberalised Asian markets, particularly at the scale required to meet their ambitions. There is also acknowledgment that much of the kind of state-of-art tech the Gulf wants to tap into is being developed by American companies.\n\nYet Gulf trade with Asia is only heading in one direction, and sovereign funds across the region are ramping up their exposure to Asian markets.\n\nIn 2021, Saudi Arabia’s $81.7bn total trade with China briefly exceeded Riyadh’s with the US, the UK and the euro area combined, according to a report by London-based Asia House.\n\nThe report, released last year, added that it expected the UAE to follow a similar pattern, with the difference between Gulf’s state trade with China and with the US, the UK and the eurozone narrowing to a few billion dollars compared to $28bn in 2010.\n\nAnd as the world transitions away from fossil fuels, the Gulf states know it is likely to be China and India that buy their last barrels of oil.\n\nChina has not sought to challenge or displace the US’s security role in the Middle East, but there are hints that it wants to move beyond traditional commercial partnerships. Its success in brokering an agreement in March for arch rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore relations was interpreted by many as a sign of Beijing’s willingness to adopt a more political role in the region.\n\nHowever, Gulf officials also recognise the dangers of getting caught in the crossfire of US-China rivalry, as the two global powers aim to “decouple” their economies.\n\n“This risk is in all this decoupling conversation [in Washington] because suddenly if we are looking at two competing technologies, the world is turning into VHS and Betamax,” a UAE official says, a reference to home video format war in the 1980s.\n\nStill, the Gulf states are willing to rankle Washington by deepening ties with Beijing and tapping into Chinese technology, such as 5G telecommunications networks. Two years ago, the UAE was forced to address US suspicions that China was building a military base at an Abu Dhabi port.\n\nThe UAE is this month conducting its first joint air exercise with China, according to Chinese state media. It was also reported that Saudi Arabia bought $4bn of weapons from China after the Zhuhai Air Show in November, which would make it far larger than previous Saudi-Chinese arms deals.\n\nThe message to the US from Riyadh and Abu Dhabi is, “We will come to you first, but if you don’t deliver we will go elsewhere,” analysts say, be it weapons or technology. They add that the Gulf states are not averse to playing one country off against another. But it is a fine balance.\n\n“The fundamental strategic dilemma for them remains that their security is in the west, their energy politics is with Russia and their prosperity is increasingly with China and the rest of Asia,” Hokayem says.\n\n“It requires careful footwork and constant engagement to manage these complex relationships. They have to massively invest in all those capitals, in political, economic and geoeconomic terms. It’s a delicate game.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Sarah White in Paris and James Kynge in London\n\nData visualisation by Keith Fray",

    "body": "Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are buying up thousands of the high-performance Nvidia chips crucial for building artificial intelligence software, joining a global AI arms race that is squeezing the supply of Silicon Valley’s hottest commodity.\n\nThe Gulf powerhouses have publicly stated their goal of becoming leaders in AI as they pursue ambitious plans to turbocharge their economies. But the push has also raised concerns about potential misuse of the technology by the oil-rich states’ autocratic leaders.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the moves, Saudi Arabia has bought at least 3,000 of Nvidia’s H100 chips — a $40,000 processor described by Nvidia chief Jensen Huang as “the world’s first computer [chip] designed for generative AI” — via the public research institution King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (Kaust).\n\nMeanwhile, the UAE has also secured access to thousands of Nvidia chips and has already developed its own open-source large language model, known as Falcon, at the state-owned Technology Innovation Institute in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi.\n\n“The UAE has made a decision that it wants to . . . own and control its own computational power and talent, have their own platforms and not be dependent on the Chinese or the Americans,” said a person familiar with Abu Dhabi’s thinking.\n\n“Importantly, they have the capital to do it, and they have the energy resources to do that and are attracting the best global talent as well,” the person added.\n\nThe Gulf states’ purchases of large numbers of Nvidia chips via state-owned groups come as the world’s leading tech companies rush to obtain the scarce chips for AI development.\n\nLast week the Financial Times reported that leading Chinese tech groups such as Tencent and Alibaba are seeking to buy up Nvidia’s high-performance chips.\n\nThe most advanced LLMs are owned by US companies including Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google. These groups are also the primary buyers of Nvidia’s H100 and A100 chips.\n\nAccording to multiple sources close to Nvidia and its manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the chipmaker will ship about 550,000 of its latest H100 chips globally in 2023, primarily to US tech companies. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Kaust will receive 3,000 of these specialist chips, worth about $120mn in total, by the end of 2023, according to two people close to the university’s AI labs.\n\nBy comparison, estimates suggest OpenAI trained its advanced GPT-3 model on 1,024 A100 chips — the predecessor to Nvidia’s latest chips — in just over a month.\n\nThe Saudi university, which, according to people close to Kaust, also owns at least 200 A100s, is building a supercomputer, Shaheen III, that will become operational this year. The machine will run 700 Grace Hoppers, Nvidia’s so-called superchips, designed for cutting-edge artificial intelligence applications.\n\nKaust will use these chips to build its own large language model — software that can generate humanlike text, images and code — similar to OpenAI’s GPT-4, which powers the popular chatbot ChatGPT, according to multiple sources close to the state-owned university.\n\nThe Saudi LLM is being developed by the Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics lab at Kaust, which is primarily staffed by Chinese researchers.\n\nMany Chinese nationals with AI expertise have chosen to work at Kaust because they have been prevented from studying and working in the US after graduating from Chinese universities on the US entity list, according to two Kaust sources.\n\nKaust did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the UAE, which in 2017 was the first nation to establish an AI ministry, has launched a “Generative AI Guide” as part of the government’s “commitment to reinforcing its global position as a pioneer in technology and artificial intelligence sectors” as well as “regulatory frameworks to limit the negative use of technology”.\n\nThe UAE’s Falcon model, which is now freely available online, was trained on 384 A100 chips over two months earlier this year.\n\n“I was extremely impressed by the model, considering the resources they used. For a while, it was among the best models in the open-source world,” said one leading AI researcher and LLM expert.\n\nIt also impressed well-known venture capitalists such as Marc Andreessen, who tried to establish contact with the team, according to a UAE sovereign wealth investor. A spokesperson for Andreessen declined to comment.\n\nThe UAE government has purchased a new batch of Nvidia chips to prepare for more LLM-related applications and cloud services, according to a person at the UAE industrial development bureau.\n\nWestern AI leaders and human rights experts have raised concerns that the software developed in the two countries may lack the ethical guardrails and safety features that large tech companies are trying to build into the technology.\n\n“Human rights defenders and journalists are frequent targets of government crackdowns [in UAE and Saudi Arabia],” said Iverna McGowan, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Europe office, in Brussels.\n\n“Pair this with the fact that we know how AI can have discriminatory impacts, or be used to turbocharge unlawful surveillance. It’s a frightening thought,” she added.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE have been buoyed by petrodollar windfalls after last year’s surge in energy prices, and both manage some of the world’s largest and most active sovereign investment funds.\n\nRepresentatives of Gulf state-affiliated funds have recently approached AI start-ups in the west in an effort to access code and LLM expertise in exchange for computing resources, according to the chief executives of two European AI companies, who declined their offers.\n\n“We have had offers of immense financings and access to data, in order to tap indirectly into our talent,” one of the executives said.\n\nOpenAI chief executive Sam Altman in June praised Abu Dhabi’s foresight in recognising the importance of AI during a visit to the region. In a question-and-answer session in the city’s financial district, he said the Gulf region could “play a central role in this global conversation” around the emerging technology and its regulation.\n\n“There has been discussion about AI, here in particular, in Abu Dhabi, before it was cool,” he said. “Now everyone is on the AI bandwagon, which we are excited about, but we have special appreciation for the people who were talking about this when everyone thought AI was not going to happen.”\n\nAdditional reporting by George Hammond and Simeon Kerr",

    "blurb": "Lawyers say intergovernmental deal over Dar es Salaam port is too generous to Emirati interests",
    "date": "2023-08-0900:00:00.0",
    "body": "At least 22 people have been threatened or detained for criticising a deal between Tanzania and Dubai that covers the management of a Tanzanian port by Emirati logistics company DP World, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\n“The Tanzanian government’s suppression of its critics is a troubling sign of its low tolerance for dissenting views,” researcher Oryem Nyeko said of the official response to those voicing concerns about an intergovernmental agreement signed last year and ratified by Tanzania’s parliament in June.\n\n“The government should respect the right to freedom of expression and assembly,” he added.\n\nRugemeleza Nshala, a lawyer and activist, said he was forced to flee Tanzania after being summoned for questioning, adding that he was threatened over his views on the deal that, according to the agreement, provides a legal framework for “developing, improving, managing and operating the sea and lake ports in areas like special economic zones, logistic parks and trade corridors”.\n\nBoniface Mwabukusi, another lawyer, was arrested after holding a news conference about the agreement.\n\nThe government said DP World, which operates several ports in east Africa, would help improve efficiency and triple revenue at Dar es Salaam port, a crucial gateway to Tanzania and to landlocked neighbours such as Uganda and Rwanda.\n\nBut critics said it damaged Tanzania’s national interest by giving DP World the right to manage coastal and lakeside ports in perpetuity. The agreement contained several unusual clauses that weakened Tanzania’s ability to change laws, annul contracts or seek competitive bids, said lawyers.\n\nClauses that have raised concern include one that prevents withdrawal from the deal “in any circumstances, including in the event of material breach, fundamental change of circumstances, severance of diplomatic or consular relations”.\n\n“What kind of agreement is this that can’t be terminated,” said John Nyanje, a Kenyan law expert who compared it to those imposed on countries in the global south in the 1960s. “This is not how investment treaties work.”\n\nNyanje also questioned so-called “stability clauses” that would protect DP World from any future changes to Tanzanian law. “No reasonable country should tolerate those,” he said.\n\nFatma Karume, a prominent Tanzanian lawyer, said: “The Dubai and Tanzania treaty is simply a one-way ticket. It is just to protect DP World.”\n\nDP World did not provide a response, but people familiar with its thinking said critics were confusing a framework agreement between two countries with specific commercial contracts that were yet to be concluded.\n\nThe agreement was signed after a visit to Dubai by Tanzania’s president Samia Suluhu Hassan at which 37 memoranda of understanding were concluded. Hassan has sought to portray Tanzania as open for investment since becoming president in 2021 following the death of John Magufuli.\n\nFreeman Mboye, chair of Chadema, Tanzania’s main opposition party, who was imprisoned by Magufuli but released after Hassan took over, said the agreement gave Dubai free rein to develop seaports along Tanzania’s Indian Ocean coastline as well as on lakes Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa, the three biggest on the continent.\n\n“It’s not in Tanzania’s interest and the moment you read the contract you’ll see why,” Mboye said.\n\nGerson Msigwa, Tanzania’s government spokesman, has denied there were any problems with the intergovernmental agreement. “I want to emphasise that no port has been privatised, we shall not privatise any port, and we are not selling any port,” he said last month, adding that the deal was a framework for private sector collaboration and improving efficiency. Tanzania’s government did not respond to specific requests for comment.\n\nDP World operates several ports in Africa, including Berbera and Dakar, as well as a dry port in Rwanda. The company, which is majority state-owned, has been in previous controversies. Djibouti seized Doraleh port in 2018 after accusing DP World of not operating it in the country’s national interest. In the UK, DP World’s subsidiary P&O Ferries faced criticism over the sacking last year of hundreds of ferry staff.\n\nTanzania has previously faced criticism for bowing to Dubai’s interests. Lawyers, human right activists and environmentalists have accused the authorities there of carrying out the mass eviction of Maasai pastoralists to extend a hunting concession with alleged links to the families of Emirati rulers.",

    "event_name": "Abu Dhabi oil giant builds internal ‘investment bank’ to chase $50bn in global deals",
    "blurb": "Adnoc amasses 50-strong team as UAE state oil group seeks to diversify business and expand overseas",
    "date": "2023-08-0900:00:00.0",
    "body": "The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company has amassed a nearly 50-strong team of dealmakers and is pursuing roughly $50bn in transactions as part of a push to diversify its business and expand abroad.Adnoc, led since 2016 by Sultan al-Jaber, has quietly assembled a suite of Wall Street talent, according to people familiar with its inner workings, transforming the United Arab Emirates’ once sleepy state group into a business more like an energy supermajor.\n\nThe investment team, run by former senior Morgan Stanley executive Klaus Froehlich, has become one of the most important units for the company’s strategy, with insiders describing it as akin to an “internal investment bank”.\n\nAdnoc’s pursuit of a bevy of multibillion-dollar acquisitions under Jaber’s strategy has stood out in an otherwise dismal year for dealmaking. The group is pursuing deals simultaneously with Brazilian petrochemical maker Braskem, Austria’s OMV and German chemical company Covestro.\n\n“They are supercharged, with the investment team given the mandate to go out and look at investments,” said one banker familiar with the company. “They have pivoted from an internally focused portfolio management mindset to one that is internationally focused.”\n\nThe shift marks the latest step in the transformation of Adnoc from a highly profitable but staid state oil and gas producer to a company with ambitions of building a global portfolio spanning chemicals, plastics and beyond.Jaber’s appointment in January as president of this year’s COP28 climate summit in the UAE has sparked heavy criticism from environmental activists as well as a group of more than 130 EU and US lawmakers who called for his removal.\n\nBut he has shaken up Adnoc in ways previously unimaginable among Gulf state oil companies, streamlining its workforce and monetising its assets.\n\nFroehlich, group chief investment officer, joined in 2020 after a more than 16-year career at Morgan Stanley, including as head of Mideast and north Africa investment banking, and three years as chief financial officer at the Saudi Binladin construction group before founding his own advisory firm.People close to the company say one attraction of working there is that while many other deals in the industry fall through, Adnoc has a record of aggressive execution.The company has earmarked $150bn in capital expenditure over the next five years towards expanding its oil and gas production, with $15bn set aside for low-carbon solutions over a longer period. It was an early mover in selling off assets and streamlining its business, taking a different approach to the region’s top producer Saudi Aramco, which floated a piece of the entire company. In 2019 Adnoc sold off stakes in its pipelines to BlackRock and KKR in a $4bn move to fund development that was part of a broader plan to generate cash from existing assets and partner with blue-chip international groups.Over the past two years it has floated five subsidiaries at a roughly $140bn combined market capitalisation. “They’re increasingly thinking more like an investment manager and, like the UAE itself, want to build a bigger global footprint,” said Raad Alkadiri at Eurasia Group. “Part of it is ambition, part of it is prestige, but part is how do you manage your own fortune rather than leaving it to the whims of the energy transition.”\n\nDespite Jaber’s jam-packed schedule this year as he jets around the world to build support for COP28, deals involving Adnoc keep stacking up.\n\nNot only is the company seeking a €13bn takeover of Covestro and in the midst of a nearly $8bn joint bid for Braskem alongside US investor Apollo, it is also working on an ambitious plan to merge its chemicals division with that of Austria’s OMV in what could be a more than $30bn deal.Meanwhile, it has teamed up with BP to launch a $2bn bid for a 50 per cent stake in an Israeli natural gas group as part of a plan to jointly pursue gas projects in the eastern Mediterranean. On Friday it announced it had taken a 30 per cent stake in an Azerbaijan gasfield, giving the group a foothold in pipeline supplies to the EU.“They see a huge amount of capital required in the energy sector, a lot of people not investing sufficiently, and a big opportunity for a company that’s investing aggressively,” said Robin Mills, a Middle East energy expert and chief executive of Qamar Energy.“This is the new Adnoc and it’s much more aggressive and innovative than it ever used to be,” he added.\n\nWhile Adnoc has built out extensive internal capabilities, it still works with external advisers, including Wall Street banks, according to people familiar with the matter.The company must navigate complex dynamics to seal some of its acquisitions. Under the OMV deal the Austrian group’s chemicals arm Borealis would be combined with Borouge, the chemicals company majority owned by Adnoc and listed in Abu Dhabi. Each side holds stakes in the other but under an announced framework OMV said the aim would be to become “equal partners under a jointly controlled, listed platform for potential growth acquisitions”. The talks have been “quite start-stop”, according to a person familiar with the matter, but both sides are motivated by the prospect of creating a new market leader by sharing technology and combining expertise in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe two sides must reach an agreement on a valuation for the unlisted Borealis, which could be valued at about $10bn, while Borouge trades at a market capitalisation of about $22bn. Other issues to be hammered out include where the merged business would be listed and headquartered. Covestro, meanwhile, has rebuffed a €13bn approach from Adnoc, prompting the state group to raise its offer.\n\nJaber is also using dealmaking to strengthen Adnoc’s renewables business. His company has taken a stake in Masdar, the Emirati renewable energy company that he helped launch in 2006, with plans to further its growth.\n\n“In terms of their strategic thinking they are generally way ahead of most other state energy companies when it comes to thinking about their place in the energy transition,” said Amrita Sen at Energy Aspects. “But their ability to execute on their strategy is yet to be fully tested.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Arash Massoudi\n\n",

    "blurb": "Low tax and booming internal job market helps emirate cement position as a global industry hub",
    "date": "2023-08-0900:00:00.0",
    "body": "A growing number of top hedge funds are setting up shop in Dubai, as the lure of low taxes and the region’s deep-pocketed investors cements the emirate’s status as an industry hub.\n\nQuant investing giant AQR, and multi-strategy firms such as Sculptor and Lighthouse Investment Partners are among the hedge funds to establish a presence in the city over the past year, according to regulatory disclosures and industry sources.\n\nThe moves highlight how the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic has added impetus to the Dubai authorities’ two-decade push to become the regional base for the hedge fund industry. Of the 40 funds registered in the emirate as of July, more than a third arrived in the past 12 months, according to figures from the Dubai International Financial Centre. The majority are London or New York-based firms opening subsidiaries.\n\nExecutives and traders say the absence of personal income tax in the United Arab Emirates has left the city well-placed in an escalating war for hedge fund talent which has seen in-demand portfolio managers offered millions of dollars in signing bonuses.\n\nBut hedge fund executives also admit a local presence is as much a long-term business decision and signal to the region’s influential and wealthy state-backed investors.\n\n“The sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and the UAE are an important source of capital for hedge funds so there has always been a need to travel there,” said Sean McGould, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at Lighthouse, which opened the doors of its Dubai office in April and has one employee based there. “It’s important to have an office there to show commitment on the ground.”\n\nIndustry insiders said the number of hedge funds in Dubai is nearing a critical mass that has made it feasible to hire from competitors in the region, rather than trying to attract talent from abroad.\n\n“Dubai has reached a certain size and scale where there are now intra-hedge fund moves,” said an executive at a multibillion-dollar family office that has a base in Dubai.\n\nCredit specialist hedge fund King Street Capital Management, which has $23bn under management, opened its Dubai office in March, though its presence is still small. Managing director Reda Zebdi is the only employee in the office for now but the hedge fund said it intended to grow “naturally” over the coming years.\n\n“Since Covid, many firms, including King Street, have tried to move closer to investors in the region” he said. “When an ecosystem is building and building fast we want to be part of it.”\n\nHe added that in addition to supporting clients, the firm was looking at local investment opportunities.\n\nIzzy Englander’s Millennium Management was one of the first big US hedge funds to move to the city when it hired a Dubai-based portfolio manager in 2020. The near $60bn-in-assets firm now has about 50 people working there, the majority of whom are investment professionals, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nMillennium declined to comment.\n\nThe talent war among so-called multi-strategy firms — the hedge fund giants that increasingly dominate the industry — has led others to follow suit. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, ExodusPoint Capital Management and more recently Balyasny Asset Management have all opened Dubai offices.\n\nBalyasny, which has $21bn under management, plans to have 10 teams led by portfolio managers on the ground by the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter. However, not every member of the PM teams will necessarily move to Dubai.\n\nBut the shift to the UAE isn’t just about tax and raising capital. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are increasingly seen by wealthy hedge funders as attractive alternative cities to London, New York and Hong Kong after the pandemic.\n\nHedge fund firms say that they saw an increase in inquiries from employees keen to relocate to the Middle East during government-mandated lockdowns in Europe and the US. Dubai’s Covid restrictions were much less harsh compared with traditional hedge fund centres such as London and Hong Kong.\n\n“We were actually open in Dubai because it had a very short lockdown stint and as a result we became an interesting option for a large number of portfolio managers,” said a senior employee at one large hedge fund.\n\nThe city is not the only one in UAE to benefit from the hedge fund rush. UK macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, which has $33bn in assets, announced earlier this year that it was opening an office in Abu Dhabi.\n\nCo-founder Trifon Natsis and chief compliance officer Ryan Taylor have both moved to the city. The firm wants to hire more than 100 people there over the next 12 months, according to a person familiar with its strategy.\n\nDubai’s geographical position, straddling the European and Asian trading days, has helped.\n\n“This is the perfect timezone,” said an executive at a large fund that has just opened an office in the UAE. “You can absorb what happened in Asia close and prepare very well for European open.”\n\nDespite the rush to the Gulf, London and New York remain by far the largest centres of the global hedge fund industry, and so far no major hedge fund has moved its headquarters to the UAE. But for portfolio managers keen to maximise their earnings, it has become a popular alternative destination.\n\n“It’s a compelling draw for people, especially if you’re used to constant strikes in London, a high tax burden and public services being severely impacted,” the executive added. “It’s exciting to see the real buzz and enthusiasm.”\n\nThis article has been amended to reflect that registration figures were provided by the Dubai International Financial Centre",

    "date": "2023-08-0300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK government was on Thursday ordered to apologise and pay £1,500 in compensation to a British academic imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates and allegedly tortured in 2018, causing a rupture between London and its Gulf ally.\n\nThe parliamentary ombudsman said there was a “profound failure” by British embassy staff in missing signs of potential torture when they visited Matthew Hedges, a doctoral candidate at Durham university, in prison in the UAE.\n\nHedges was arrested at Dubai airport in early May 2018 on suspicion of being a British spy after conducting research for his PhD thesis on military developments following the Arab Spring. He was given a life sentence in November the same year, only to be pardoned days later as his case threatened to derail the country’s close ties with Britain.\n\nFollowing his release the relationship between the two governments has improved, although both sides continue to disagree over the true nature of Hedges’ role in Abu Dhabi.\n\nHedges said he was interrogated for up to 15 hours a day, kept in solitary confinement and forcibly administered with medication after being sentenced to life in jail. The UAE has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Hedges.\n\nThe academic, who has previously criticised the government’s failure to launch a promised inquiry after he returned to the UK, said he was supervised at all times by prison guards who told him what he was allowed to say when he was visited by embassy officials in 2018.\n\nHe made an official complaint to the ombudsman, accusing the Foreign Office of failing to follow its own guidance on detecting potential torture and mistreatment. The ombudsman noted that Hedges’ voice was audibly shaking when British embassy staff came to visit him and that he avoided making eye contact and told them he was having panic attacks.\n\nForeign Office guidelines state that staff should act on warning signs of mental and physical stress of British detainees even when the officials do not have the consent of the individual. The ombudsman found that Foreign Office staff should have been aware that Hedges was not in a position to consent.\n\nRebecca Hilsenrath, the ombudsman’s chief executive, said it was “hard to imagine” what Hedges endured and that his “nightmare was made even worse by being failed by the British government”.\n\nShe added: “We have asked the [Foreign Office] to make sure it will fully use all its powers to protect British citizens abroad and ensure that they are there precisely when they are most needed,” she said. The ombudsman also called on the government to apologise to Hedges and pay him £1,500 in compensation.\n\nThe UK government said it would review the ombudsman’s findings and respond in due course. “The best interests of British nationals, including those detained overseas, is at the heart of our consular work and we support their families wherever we can,” it said.\n\nThe UAE government said allegations of mistreatment of Hedges were categorically false and lacked any evidentiary basis. “His claims of being ‘tortured’ while in UAE custody are wholly untrue and without any foundation whatsoever,” it said in a statement.\n\n“Mr Hedges received entirely proper care and treatment. He had bedding, reading material, a television, access to family, consular officials and lawyers, and extensive medical care . . . He was never subjected to, or threatened with, either torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of any sort.”",

    "blurb": "Announcement made as Gulf country prepares to host COP28 climate talks",

    "body": "The UAE’s state energy company has brought forward its emissions reduction target as the Gulf country prepares to host the COP28 climate talks in December.\n\nAdnoc, which is one of the biggest oil producers in the world, on Monday said it would aim to achieve net zero emissions from its operations by 2045 rather than 2050 and cut methane emissions to zero by 2030.\n\nThe announcement comes as the UAE, the world’s eighth-largest oil producer, faces criticism from activists and a group of US and EU lawmakers over its preparations for the climate talks, which will be chaired by Adnoc chief executive Sultan al-Jaber.\n\nCritics have argued that al-Jaber’s role as head of Adnoc is at odds with his leadership of the talks.\n\nThis month, the Adnoc chief executive put forward his vision for COP28, which included setting a “mid-century” timeline for the phasing down of fossil fuels produced without the capture of emissions.\n\nHowever, climate activists have called on the incoming COP president to go much further and commit to the phasing down of all new production.\n\nAdnoc’s new net zero goal is the most ambitious emissions-reduction target of any large state-owned oil and gas company.\n\nBut it still only covers scope 1 and 2 emissions produced from its own operations.\n\nThis excludes scope 3 emissions, created when the fuels are burnt. These represent the majority of the emissions linked to fossil fuel consumption, which most European oil majors, including BP and Shell, have set targets to cut.\n\nAdnoc framed the new targets as evidence of its ambition to play a leading role in cutting the emissions associated with fossil fuel production, despite its plans to increase oil output this decade.\n\n“These targets mark a new chapter in Adnoc’s transformational journey to a lower-carbon future,” it said.\n\nIt aims to cut scope 1 and 2 emissions by powering more of its oil and gas production with renewable energy, and capturing and storing 5mn tonnes of carbon emissions a year by 2030.\n\nAdnoc in January said it would allocate $15bn to “decarbonisation initiatives” such as carbon capture and storage, electrification and energy efficiency between 2023 and 2027, representing approximately 10 per cent of the total capital spending during the period.\n\nOn Monday, it said it would make additional investments in the “coming months” to help meet its updated decarbonisation targets.\n\nAdnoc also released details of its carbon emissions for the first time. Last year the total scope 1 and 2 emissions from its oil and gas production was approximately 24mn tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, representing about 7kg of CO₂ per barrel of oil equivalent, which was one of the lowest carbon intensity levels in the world, it said.\n\nGulf rival Saudi Aramco emits about 10kg of CO₂e/boe, while BP emits about 15kg of CO₂e/boe.",

    "body": "US national security officials are scrutinising an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund’s planned $3bn takeover of New York-based Fortress Investment Group amid concerns in Washington over the United Arab Emirates’ ties to China, people close to the situation told the Financial Times.\n\nThe review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an inter-governmental agency that vets whether deals can harm national security, is in its early stages and a decision is not expected for several months, the people added.\n\nAbu Dhabi’s Mubadala agreed to buy a majority stake in Fortress, which manages about $46bn in assets and specialises in distressed debt investing, in May from Japan’s SoftBank Group. Mubadala, which is run by chief executive Khaldoon al-Mubarak, said it intended to close the deal in the first quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nMubadala and Fortress declined to comment. The US Treasury, which oversees the Cfius process, said it did not comment on transactions that it “may or not be reviewing” but added that it was “committed to taking all necessary actions within its authority to safeguard US national security”.\n\nThe Cfius action comes as the Biden administration steps up scrutiny of China-related investment and prepares to unveil an executive order that would require US companies investing in certain sensitive sectors — including semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing — to notify the federal government. It would also prohibit investment in certain areas.\n\nThe FT previously revealed that Cfius, which can require steps to mitigate its concerns or block a deal outright, intervened in SoftBank’s 2017 takeover of Fortress. Cfius forced SoftBank to relinquish day-to-day control over Fortress and took further steps to monitor SoftBank’s level of direct influence on the investment firm.\n\nAt the time, the FT reported that Cfius was concerned about some of SoftBank’s investments, which included a large stake in China’s Alibaba Group, and the business links of its founder Masayoshi Son.\n\nMubadala acquired a near 10 per cent stake in Fortress in 2019 and received Cfius clearance for that purchase, according to people with knowledge of that review. However, a new review is needed for its plan to purchase a further 60 per cent in Fortress, the people added. As part of the deal, Fortress insiders would own the remaining 30 per cent with a special class of shares that allows them to appoint a majority of its board.\n\nMubadala has other investments in the US, which include a stake in US private equity firm Silver Lake thanks to close relations between its co-chief executive Egon Durban and Mubarak.\n\nOne expert in the Cfius process told the FT that there were likely two reasons the inter-agency body will take a close look at the planned Fortress takeover, including growing concerns in Washington over budding relations between Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, and China.\n\n“What we are also witnessing in the pendulum swinging back to where sovereign wealth funds are under increased scrutiny,” the person said, referring to the period after Cfius investigated a deal for Dubai Ports World to buy P&O, the UK-based port operator.\n\nCfius approved the deal in 2006, but following uproar from US politicians, including then-senator Hillary Clinton, the UAE compelled DP World to relinquish control of five port terminals in the US that it acquired in its purchase of P&O.\n\nThe US concern was not about China, but about its ports being vulnerable to terrorist attacks. US lawmakers alleged that Dubai was a transfer point for nuclear-related components to Iran, Libya and North Korea.\n\nThe Biden administration has been concerned about indications that China was building a military facility at Khalifa Port in UAE, as part of an effort to project military power. China has one international base, located in Djibouti, and is building another naval facility in Cambodia.\n\nIn September last year, President Joe Biden also issued an order telling Cfius to pay close attention to deals involving critical technologies, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology. While the order did not name China, the industries are frequently mentioned by US intelligence agencies as ones where China is trying to obtain US technology.",

    "body": "The United Arab Emirates said it had signed agreements estimated to be worth $50bn with Turkey as President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan tours the oil-rich Gulf in a bid to attract investment from the region and bolster his country’s ailing economy.\n\nThe UAE’s state news agency said the Gulf state and Turkey forged a series of provisional agreements that included the establishment of a joint economic and trade commission, commitments to develop energy and natural resources projects, and an extradition pact.\n\nADQ, one of Abu Dhabi’s state investment funds, also said it would provide up to $8.5bn through bonds to support reconstruction efforts after February’s earthquake that devastated a vast area of southern Turkey. The fund also said it would provide $3bn in export credit financing to Turkish companies to boost bilateral trade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the estimated $50bn value of all the agreements was calculated. But the deals mark a deepening of ties between regional powers that have spent much of the past decade at loggerheads, often backing rival sides during the turmoil that erupted across the Middle East after the 2011 popular Arab uprisings.\n\nErdoğan, who held talks with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, said the agreements would “elevate our relations to the level of strategic partnership”.\n\nThe Turkish leader has this week visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE to drum up support and investment for Turkey’s economy after he appointed a new economic team following his victory in May elections.\n\nHis government has returned to more orthodox economic policies after Erdoğan’s management of the economy was widely blamed for pushing the lira to record lows against the dollar, fuelling soaring inflation and scaring off foreign investors.\n\nBankers said Erdoğan took with him on his tour of the Gulf a list of assets in which Turkey is seeking to sell stakes as Ankara looks to raise foreign currency to replenish severely depleted reserves and manage a yawning current account deficit.\n\nThe UAE, the Gulf’s trade and finance hub, has also over the past two years shifted away from its more assertive foreign policy towards what officials describe as economic diplomacy as it faces increasing competition from neighbouring Saudi Arabia.\n\nA Gulf-based banker said Emirati officials sent out an “all-points bulletin” to bankers in the UAE ahead of Erdogan’s visit “to be ready and help us on ideas and be ready to execute”.\n\nThe rapprochement between Abu Dhabi and Ankara began two years ago, after Sheikh Mohammed held talks with Erdoğan in the Turkish capital.\n\nAt the time, ADQ committed to invest $10bn in Turkey and had previously backed Turkish start-ups Getir, a grocery delivery company, and Trendyol, the country’s largest ecommerce firm.\n\nSheikh Mohammed visited Turkey again in June, and bankers say there is now greater clarity for investments with the new economic team in place. Led by finance minister Mehmet Şimşek, this group has strong ties across the Gulf and has begun to reverse Erdogan’s controversial policies.\n\nAnalysts say the Gulf, which is home to some of the world’s largest sovereign investment funds, was an obvious starting point for Erdoğan in his bid to rally support for the economy, as many western investors remain wary about the president’s commitment to more orthodox policies.\n\nAfter Erdoğan held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman this week, Riyadh and Ankara struck an agreement for Saudi Arabia to buy Turkish drones in what was described as Turkey’s largest ever defence export deal.",

    "blurb": "When Switzerland joined sanctions against Moscow, a chunk of the world’s oil trade relocated to the Middle East. Some predict it will stay there",
    "date": "2023-07-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "For decades, the lakeside city of Geneva was home to many of the traders who sold Russia’s oil to consumers around the world. But since Switzerland joined the embargo imposed on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine much of that trade has shifted to Dubai and other cities in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nCompanies registered in the small Gulf state bought at least 39mn tonnes of Russian oil worth more than $17bn between January and April — around a third of the country’s exports declared to customs during that period — according to Russian customs documentation analysed by the Financial Times.\n\nSome of that oil ended up in the UAE, ship-tracking data shows, landing at storage terminals in places such as Fujairah. The rest — about 90 per cent — never touched Emirati soil, instead flowing from Russian ports directly to new buyers in Asia, Africa and South America as part of one of the biggest redirections of global energy flows in history.\n\nThe energy trading industry in the UAE was already growing before Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. But the conflict, and the western sanctions that followed it, have supercharged that growth.\n\nOut of the top 20 traders of Russian crude in the first four months of the year, eight were registered in the UAE, the customs data shows. In refined petroleum products, such as diesel and fuel oil, UAE dominance was even higher, with 10 of the 20 largest traders registered in the country.\n\nThe trading boom has further enriched the nation, moving billions of dollars of additional oil revenue through its banks and attracting dozens of new companies to its free-trade zones. It has also tested relations with allies such as the US, which wants Russian oil to flow but is wary of creating new trade routes that undermine sanctions.\n\nExecutives at trading houses say Dubai, the UAE’s main commercial centre, is a heady mix of excitement, competition and suspicion as new trading teams battle for talent and trade flow in a market suddenly rife with buyers and sellers.\n\n“If you are an oil trader, this is where you want to be,” says Matt Stanley, a former trader and 20-year industry veteran who now manages client relationships in the region for data provider Kpler. “Dubai is the new Geneva.”\n\nThe UAE, which juts from the Arabian peninsula into the Gulf of Oman, has been an important commercial hub for centuries, attracting merchants who shuttled goods between Europe and Asia. In recent years it has become a major trading location for gold, diamonds and agricultural commodities, such as tea and coffee, helped by its modern business infrastructure, banking services and light-touch regulation.\n\nThe UAE is the world’s eighth-largest oil producer, but historically has not been a major oil trading location. Volumes were modest and Adnoc, Abu Dhabi’s state oil company, only set up its own trading arm three years ago.\n\nHowever, the country’s proximity to growing oil markets in Africa and Asia and the absence of personal income taxes had started to attract more profit-hungry traders even before the war in Ukraine.\n\n“This is one of the last locations in the world to live and not pay tax,” says the chief financial officer of one trading house. Traders in his group’s other offices around the world are now regularly requesting moves to Dubai, he adds. “This will become the global commodity trading hub.”\n\nAnother attraction is the UAE’s perceived political neutrality in a world where rivalries between global powers mean Russia is unlikely to be the last country to face European or US sanctions on its exports.\n\n“The UAE gives you that platform to transact, trade and travel freely,” says the chief executive of an energy trading company set up in Dubai in the past five years.\n\nBut for all the UAE’s success in building modern business infrastructure and capitalising on its geographical location, it is the war in Ukraine and the UAE’s willingness to welcome Russian businesses that are driving the current boom. “The Ukraine crisis put it on steroids,” the chief executive says.\n\nThe Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, in the city’s gleaming Jumeirah Lake Towers district, is one of the UAE’s biggest and most successful free zones. A three-dimensional model in the lobby of the headquarters displays the district’s 87 gleaming residential and commercial towers across its two-square-km site, home to 22,000 registered companies.\n\nIt is also, arguably, the new centre of the Russian oil trading universe. Out of the 104 buyers of Russian oil listed on Russian customs declarations between January and April, at least 25 were companies registered in the DMCC.\n\nLitasco Middle East DMCC accounted for most of the near-16mn tonnes of Russian crude and refined fuels traded by the Lukoil-owned group between January and April, making it the biggest single buyer of Russian oil during the period, according to the customs data.\n\nThe company previously had only a representative office in the UAE, but some of its trading operations moved from Geneva to Dubai last year. One former Litasco trader says the group had taken over an entire floor in a high-rise tower at the heart of the free zone.\n\nSwitzerland-headquartered Litasco SA said that following a reorganisation last year, Litasco Middle East was “no longer a subsidiary” of Litasco in Geneva. The Swiss entity “has very limited volumes of crude oil and refined products from Russia, according to the exemptions from the embargo on Russian production given by the EU,” it added.\n\nDMCC-registered Demex Trading and Qamah Logistics are also among the larger traders of Russian crude. Both were incorporated during the past three years; neither could be reached for comment.\n\nTrading Russian oil from Dubai is not illegal. Western sanctions only prohibit imports into the EU, UK and other countries enforcing the G7’s rules, such as Switzerland. Under the restrictions western companies can also continue selling Russian oil to other parts of the world if that oil is sold under a certain price.\n\nThe measures have been designed to keep Russian oil flowing to new non-western buyers, while reducing the revenue flowing to the Kremlin. Washington has even encouraged traders to keep moving Russian oil to avoid supply disruptions, provided they trade below the relevant price cap.\n\nWhile Dubai-registered traders are not obliged to comply with the price cap, some have chosen to do so in order to maintain access to western services such as shipping, banking and insurance.\n\nGeneva-based Gunvor, for example, has said it incorporated a second entity in Dubai in October to segregate “the handling and financing of any potential Russia-related deals” from the rest of its trading activities.\n\nGunvor had ceased trading Russian crude but bought about $330mn of Russian refined fuels between January and April, all in compliance with the west’s sanctions and price cap policy, it told the FT in June. It disputed some of the customs data, which showed exports by Gunvor worth over $500mn during the period.Helima Croft, a former CIA analyst and global head of commodities research at RBC Capital Markets, says Washington does not mind where Russian oil is traded from provided it is done transparently. “As long as these Russian barrels are below the cap, these trading houses are doing nothing wrong,” she says. “It’s Washington’s price cap plan in action.”\n\nOther traders, however, appear to be using Dubai-based subsidiaries to legally buy and sell oil above the cap by employing non-European shipping and financial service providers.\n\nParamount Energy and Commodities, for example, transferred its Russian trading activity last year from Geneva to a DMCC-registered subsidiary, which has continued to market a crude blend from eastern Russia that has consistently traded above the G7’s $60-a-barrel cap, according to pricing data. Swiss authorities questioned the trader in April about its switch to Dubai, the FT reported in July.\n\nParamount said at the time that it had responded to the questions in full, informing the regulator that the Swiss entity had ceased all transactions involving Russian oil before the price cap took effect and that its UAE affiliate was a separate legal entity with different directors.\n\nThe biggest contributors to Dubai’s Russian oil boom, however, are not established players but a network of previously unknown companies with opaque ownership structures that are collectively moving billions of dollars of oil a month.\n\nAmong the largest traders of both crude oil and refined fuels from Russia is a company called Tejarinaft FZCO, registered in another free zone called Dubai Silicon Oasis.\n\nTejarinaft — “oil trade” in Arabic — was incorporated two months after the Russian invasion. Corporate records list Hicham Fizazi, a Moroccan national, as the sole director and the general manager. He is the only named shareholder, although the records do not disclose whether he owns all or part of the company.\n\nCorporate records reviewed by the FT also list Fizazi as the sole director and only named shareholder of at least two other UAE-registered companies trading Russian oil: Amur Trading FZCO, registered in Dubai Silicon Oasis in August, and Amur Investments Ltd, registered in Abu Dhabi in September.\n\nRival traders say they had never heard of Fizazi before last year. They believe the three companies are part of a network set up by, or on behalf of, Rosneft to help the Kremlin-controlled producer to move its oil after European former partners such as Trafigura and Vitol stepped away from trading Russian crude last year.\n\nCustoms declarations suggest that Tejarinaft, Amur Trading and Amur Investments have only ever exported oil from Rosneft or Rosneft projects, trading almost $8bn of Russian crude and refined fuels from the producer between September and April.\n\nTejarinaft alone exported $6.71bn of Russian oil between September and March, exclusively for Rosneft, according to the 394 customs declarations during the period.\n\nRosneft did not respond to a request for comment. Emails to the address provided on Tejarinaft’s website bounced back as undeliverable, the telephone number listed there connected to a general inquiries line for the free zone while the online “contact us” form did not work. Amur Trading and Amur Investments could not be reached.\n\nBen Higgins, a Dubai-based investigations specialist at risk consultancy Wallbrook, part of Anthesis, says he has seen a big increase in requests from banks and other corporate clients for further diligence on Dubai-registered trading companies over the past year.\n\n“Incorporated across various Dubai free zones, the target entities are often very low profile and their owners — on paper — aren’t Russian nationals,” he says. “Deeper research and analysis, however, often find multiple leads back to Russia.”\n\nSome of the individuals Wallbrook has investigated also appear to have played similar roles in businesses dealing with oil from Iran or Venezuela, Higgins says, “always a hop ahead of the authorities, shuffling between hotspots such as Cyprus, Hong Kong, Latvia and Dubai”.\n\nWhile the Russian oil trading business is scattered across Dubai’s sparkling high-rise offices, the heart of the physical trade is 100km east at the dusty port city of Fujairah.\n\nThe Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ) is the largest commercial storage facility in the region for refined oil products. The site’s 262 towering white storage tanks stretch for several kilometres along either side of the road from the port. Right now many of them are filled to the brim with oil, much of it from Russia.\n\nMonthly imports of Russian fuels into Fujairah increased from nothing in April 2022 to a peak of 141,000 barrels a day during December. According to Pamela Munger, an oil analyst at data provider Vortexa, that represented 40 per cent of all fuel flowing into the terminal that month. Last month, Fujairah received an average of 105,000 barrels a day from Russia, the data shows.\n\nThe influx has driven up the prices operators can charge for storage but also created a “two tier market, where those tanks willing to take Russian product can charge a premium,” one Dubai-based oil trader said. FOIZ did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVTTI, which is partly owned by Vitol, is one of a handful of western companies operating storage tanks at Fujairah. VTTI said it did accept Russian fuels into its tanks and stressed that “there are no sanctions in UAE with regards to Russian products, nor are western sanctions applicable to the UAE”.\n\n“Hence, product owners are allowed to move and trade Russian products into and through UAE . . . and storage companies are allowed to store Russian product in the UAE,” it said. Even if a cargo was required to comply with the G7’s price cap — for example, because it had been bought or sold by a western company or had used western shipping or insurance services — those restrictions did not apply to the storage provider, it added.\n\nA further sign of the boom in activity at Fujairah was the purchase in May by Dubai-based newcomer Montfort of an oil refinery in the FOIZ previously owned by German utility Uniper. Montfort, set up by former Trafigura trader Rashad Kussad in 2021, outbid several companies including Vitol, which owns a neighbouring facility, according to three people familiar with the deal.\n\nMontfort declined to comment further on the deal, adding that its commodity trading activities at Fujairah, and elsewhere in the world, comply with “all applicable laws, regulations, and sanctions, including those of the EU, Switzerland, UK and US”.\n\nSuch investments in physical infrastructure may have been precipitated by the war in Ukraine, but they also reflect a growing belief in the UAE that even if the Russian-fuelled boom eventually wanes, the global oil trading landscape has been changed forever.\n\n“People put the cause as the Russian situation, but that was just the start of it,” says one UAE-based trading executive, who now expects European commodity bankers to follow the traders to Dubai as Emirati banks seek to expand their service offering for the sector.\n\nFor Russian oil, as for many Russian nationals, Dubai has proved to be a welcoming, but potentially temporary, home while the war in Ukraine continues. For the scores of expatriate oil traders manning trading desks across the city, the move looks more permanent.\n\n“It is no longer a transitory environment, where you say: ‘I’ll try my luck and if I lose money I’ll hand back the keys and fly back to Europe’,” says Kpler’s Stanley. “People are now setting up roots here. People have got faith in the system.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Anastasia Stognei in Riga and Chris Cook in London\n\nThis article has been amended to incorporate information provided by Litasco SA since publication. It has also been amended to make clear that Dubai-based subsidiaries are being used legally to buy and sell oil above the Western cap on Russian crude prices",

It is also accepted as a method of payment outside the US dollar financial system.\n\nLast year, the Financial Action Task Force, the global financial crimes watchdog, placed the UAE on its grey list in a blow to its reputation.\n\nDMCC, a Dubai government entity, declined to comment.

But he has shied away from a timeline for the phase-down or phaseout of fossil fuels that the UN body of scientists has said is necessary.\n\nMariam Almheiri, the UAE minister of climate change and environment, on Tuesday said the update to the country’s own nationally determined contributions (NDCs) — pledges countries make under the Paris agreement — would bring it line with a goal of curbing temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThe Paris agreement ideally aims to limit a rise in global temperature of 1.5C. This requires a cut in global greenhouse gas emissions of 43 per cent by 2030.\n\n“I hope we can actually push the ambition even more, but right now we are just below the two-degree line,” Almheiri told reporters in Dubai.\n\nThe minister said the road map sought to achieve a 40 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 when compared with the “business as usual” scenario, under which few or limited actions are taken to tackle climate change.\n\nThe previous economy-wide emissions reduction target of 31 per cent by 2030 would have resulted in emissions more than tripling compared with 1990 levels and was regarded as “insufficient” by the independent research group Climate Action Tracker.\n\nWhen compared with the UAE’s “fair share”, which considers issues such as historic responsibility for climate change and ability to cut emissions, this target was “critically insufficient”, the group said in its last assessment.\n\n“Now with this update, we hope to move closer to the 1.5[C] category,” Almheiri said. “So if we were in the almost [sufficient category] this would be good, but we cannot judge this, as they are completely independent.”\n\nClimate Action Tracker said on Tuesday it had not yet looked at the UAE’s latest commitment.\n\nHowever, Alex Armstrong from Mighty Earth, a non-profit campaign group, said the UAE targets were not ambitious enough and well outside what was needed in order to meet the Paris agreement.\n\n“As hosts of COP28 later this year, it was imperative that UAE demonstrates global climate leadership,” he said. “However, its revised NDC only shows a 19 per cent absolute emissions reduction by the end of this crucial decade of action. The reality is that to stay within 1.5C, we need countries to slash their emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 in line with the Paris agreement.”\n\nThe UAE had a “very short window” within the remaining carbon budget to the “well below 2 degrees” level to diversify its economy from oil and gas dependency, said Mark Campanale of the Carbon Tracker Initiative think-tank.\n\nIt was “crucial” that the COP28 host make a central reference to its own plans for new fossil fuel production and link those plans to the remaining global carbon budget, he said.\n\nMinister Almheiri said the new commitment would build on the UAE’s updated national energy strategy for 2050, which included a tripling of investment in renewable energy capacity over the next seven years, and raising the share of clean energy in the overall mix by 30 per cent by 2030.",

    "body": "Soaring demand for luxury homes has propelled Dubai above the more established centres for prime property for the first time, as the Gulf business hub’s post-pandemic rebound continues to attract the world’s wealthy, including Russian buyers.\n\nDubai was the busiest market for $10mn-plus homes in the first quarter of 2023, with 92 deals worth $1.7bn, according to research by real estate consultancy Knight Frank. By comparison, Hong Kong had 67 transactions valued at $988mn, New York raised $942mn in 58 deals and 36 sales were completed in London worth $736mn.\n\nMany of the world’s richest individuals are turning to Dubai as a financial haven, as they compete to snap up a limited stock of high-end properties. “Dubai’s luxury homes market continues to attract the attention of the world’s wealthy,” said Faisal Durrani, Knight Frank’s head of Middle East Research, adding that many were second homes. Over a five-year period, the number of sales of $10mn-plus homes in Dubai has risen seventeen-fold.\n\nOn an annual basis, London claimed top spot last year with 246 $10mn-plus homes sold for $4.7bn, compared with the $3.9bn raised in Dubai in 224 transactions.\n\nThe sanctions imposed on Russia and some of its leading businesspeople in the wake of last year’s Ukraine invasion has hastened the influx of wealthy residents to Dubai from both countries. The United Arab Emirates, which has close ties to the US and Russia, has remained neutral in the conflict, saying it welcomed non-sanctioned Russians.\n\nThe Russian population of the UAE has risen fivefold since the invasion to as many as 500,000, according to unofficial estimates circling in the expatriate community.\n\n“Russian demand is still strong, but now mainly in the ultra-luxury segment,” said Inga Brykulska, an agent with Driven Properties who has helped Russians families switch to Dubai. “Many are relocating from places such as Switzerland and Great Britain. They often buy full-floor penthouses with double high ceilings, overlooking the water.”\n\nThe value of sales of $10mn-plus properties rose to $3.1bn in the first half of this year, from $3.9bn raised in the whole of 2022. The value of prime residential real estate rose 44 per cent last year, with a further 11 per cent rise in the first half, according to Knight Frank.\n\nSome market participants fear that Dubai’s third real estate boom in the past two decades will turn to bust, as occurred after the financial crash of 2009 and the oil-price related slowdown from 2014. But Durrani said there was “nothing in the data, or economic trajectory, to suggest a cliff edge moment is approaching.”\n\nThe luxury home boom has rippled through the wider property market, helping to drive up apartment and villa prices by 15 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, at the end of June, compared with the previous year period, according to Knight Frank.\n\nThis has pushed up housing and rental costs for less-wealthy residents as more professionals and blue-collar workers move in as business activity confounds economic slowdowns elsewhere.\n\nAlong with steeper food bills and higher school fees, this now threatens to undermine Dubai’s competitive advantage in attracting expatriate labour.\n\n“There still remains a strong desire for professionals to move to Dubai,” said Monica Malik, chief economist of Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. “However, the higher rent and education costs is a squeeze to more mid- and lower income households.”",

    "body": "Chess by franchise auction got off to an interesting debut in Dubai last week, when six all-grandmaster teams of six players competed in the Global Chess League (GCL) for a place in this weekend’s final decider.\n\nThe tenth and last round is on Saturday July 1 (1pm BST start) and the final between the two top teams on Sunday July 1 (4.30pm start). Chess24 has free and live commentary on all the games.\n\nMagnus Carlsen, still the world No1, leads the incongruously named SG Alpine Warriors, half of whom are Indian teenagers. The Norwegian began with three draws and a win against his now fellow ex-world champion Vishy Anand, the only Indian in the Ganges Grandmasters squad. However, a blundered pawn against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave put Carlsen back to 50 per cent.\n\nThe GCL uses an innovatory scoring and pairing system which, if successful, could interest other chess events which suffer from too many draws. The time limit of 15 minutes per player per game, plus a per move increment, is sufficient for GMs to play high quality chess.\n\nA win with White counts three points, a win with Black four points, a draw one point, and a loss zero. Unlike normal chess team matches where colours alternate between White and Black, a toss made half an hour before the start gives the toss winner the right to decide one colour for all six boards. Carlsen commented in a post-game interview that “ wins with Black are so valuable. People are still trying to find the optimal strategy, and we’re seeing interesting decisions that you don’t find in normal team chess.”\n\nCarlsen and Anand are also competing at the Zagreb rapid/blitz, starting next Monday July 3, in the $175,000 third leg of the St Louis-organised Grand Chess Tour, which has its final two legs in Missouri in November-December.\n\nOne name, however, is conspicuously absent. Ding Liren, China’s reigning world champion after Carlsen abdicated the crown, finished eighth out of 10 in May in Bucharest with a disappointing 4/9 total. Ding was scheduled to compete at Dubai this week, but withdrew late with no official reason given, and he is also missing from Zagreb.\n\nPuzzle 2526\n\nWhite mates in two moves, against any defence (by Victor Baja, 1976).

    "body": "German chemical company Covestro has rebuffed a €13bn approach from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, putting pressure on the state-owned energy company to raise its bid if it wishes to pursue a transaction.Adnoc’s bid of roughly €13bn, which would have been one of the largest deals this year, was rejected by Covestro on Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter. Covestro did not rule out further engagement, the people said.\n\nThe offer valued Covestro’s shares at about €55 each, about a 40 per cent premium to its undisturbed share price of about €39 per share. That is equivalent to an almost €11bn valuation for the company’s equity, before taking debt and other factors into account.The oil company would be supportive of management strategy, one person close to the transaction said.\n\nCovestro and representatives for Adnoc both declined to comment.\n\nIt comes as the oil-rich emirate flexes its financial muscle, deploying years of excess hydrocarbon revenues into sectors that could help the state wean itself off oil dependency.Covestro, one of Germany’s largest companies, is an insulation foam specialist that could help Adnoc expand its chemicals business as part of a broader diversification strategy. Adnoc, under the leadership of Sultan al-Jaber, who is also in charge of UAE’s hosting of the COP28 climate summit, has sought to maximise the value of the Gulf state’s resources by expanding in downstream production.\n\nThe oil company has also been trying to make its large energy-intensive plants less dependent on fossil fuels, investing in green technologies and recycling solutions that are increasingly attractive as demand grows for less environmentally hazardous components.\n\nThe rise in energy prices that has buoyed fossil fuel companies has presented the opposite challenge to chemical companies such as Covestro. In March, the company warned that profits this year would be “well below” those in 2022.Last year, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were €1.6bn, almost half the figure from the year before. “The sharp rise in energy and raw material prices during the year, especially in Europe, put a strain on the company,” Covestro said at the time.\n\nThe European gas crisis, which hit Germany particularly hard, prompted concern about the future of energy-intensive industries such as chemicals on the continent. BASF, the world’s largest chemical company by revenue, last year announced it would “permanently” downsize operations in Germany.\n\nShares in Covestro, which was spun out of Bayer in 2015, have roughly halved since a peak five years ago. They stood at €47.90 on Thursday afternoon, up by almost 20 per cent since the start of the week following reports from Bloomberg about Adnoc’s approach. The shares had gained about 1.6 per cent by Thursday afternoon.\n\nAdnoc has earmarked $150bn to invest in natural gas, chemicals and clean energy, as companies transition away from relying on fossil fuels. The state-owned company is committed to expanding domestic production of crude oil, natural gas and related products, such as plastics.\n\nIt already owns a majority stake in Borouge, a joint venture with Austria’s Borealis.",

    "date": "2023-06-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "UN secretary-general António Guterres attacked oil and gas industry attempts to justify fossil fuel expansion with carbon capture technology as “proposals to become more efficient planet wreckers”, in a speech that appeared to be a thinly-veiled critique of the UAE hosts of COP28.\n\nThe industry’s stated plans to deal largely with the emissions behind global warming by capturing them, rather than phasing out production, were undermining the climate agenda, Guterres said.\n\nThe UAE COP28 president-designate Sultan al-Jaber, who is also the head of the state oil company Adnoc, has consistently reflected the industry view that the focus should be on the control of emissions.\n\n“Let’s face facts. The problem is not simply fossil fuel emissions. It’s fossil fuels — period,” Guterres said. “We are hurtling towards disaster, eyes wide open, with far too many willing to bet it all on wishful thinking, unproven technologies and silver bullet solutions.”\n\nGuterres noted that for every dollar the industry spent on oil and gas drilling and exploration, only 4c went to clean energy and carbon capture combined. “Trading the future for thirty pieces of silver is immoral,” he said.\n\nHe added on Thursday that his comments were “not aimed at any one individual” but were an appeal to “those who have the power to change”, urging fossil fuel companies to shift their entire business to renewable energy.\n\nThe remarks come five months before the petrostate UAE is due to host COP28 in Dubai, led by Jaber. More than 130 US lawmakers and members of the European parliament wrote to UN officials and others last month to request the UAE withdraw Jaber from the role, arguing that his position as head of the state oil company risked “undermining the negotiations”.\n\nThe halfway point to COP28 was marked on Thursday in Bonn, Germany, with the conclusion of discussions over an agenda. Countries were deadlocked until the penultimate day, when they finally managed to agree on what issues might be carried over for consideration at COP28.\n\nWhile the EU had proposed an agenda item about work to cut emissions, it was ultimately not included following pushback from a group of oil and gas producing nations including Saudi Arabia. Instead, the discussions on the issue at Bonn will be recorded in a “note”, to inform the talks at COP28.\n\nPakistani co-chair of the Bonn talks, Nabeel Munir, at one point warned the negotiators that all their work would be wasted if an agenda was not officially adopted, accusing them of acting like a “primary school class”. The ambassador, whose country has been devastated by floods, urged them to “please wake up, what is happening around you is unbelievable.”\n\nOne notable outcome at Bonn was a decision by the UN to require all participants at future climate COPs to disclose their affiliations. That follows years of pressure by campaigners demanding greater transparency at UN climate negotiations over concerns about fossil fuel industry lobbying.\n\nProgress at Bonn is considered a key milestone in negotiations ahead of COP28. Climate experts had hoped that the UAE presidency would outline its vision for the Dubai summit, and expressed disappointment on Thursday.\n\nWhile Jaber took a step further than before to say at a meeting in Bonn that the phase down of fossil fuels was inevitable, this did not include a timeline or a plan for ending new oil and gas production.\n\nWhether the COP28 presidency would allow countries to have an “open and transparent discussion” about including a commitment to phasing down fossil fuels in the final COP decision text remained the key question, said Alden Meyer, from the think-tank E3G.",

    "body": "UN climate conference organisers are pitching for top corporate sponsors for the Dubai summit at the same time as the United Arab Emirates attempts to combat rising criticism of the petrostate’s leadership of COP28.\n\nThe UAE COP28 has offered sponsorship packages ranging up to $8.2mn (Dh30mn) for a principal partner to enjoy privileged access in the controlled “blue zone” where world leaders gather, according to documents sent to prospective sponsors. Space in the “green zone”, open to civil society and small business, is less than $7,000 (Dh25,000). Expressions of interest for pavilions close this week for the event starting on November 30.\n\nThe marketing drive comes as activists and more than 100 western politicians have been vocal in opposition to the appointment of Sultan al-Jaber as president-designate for the UN climate talks while he is also in charge of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. The US and the EU have so far continued to back the UAE.\n\nThrough this public relations battle, the COP28 team has failed to retain at least three international communications agencies over the past year, including BCW, Edelman and FGS, people aware of the matter said.\n\nCOP28 is now looking to hire another consultancy to take over communications support. The organisers have also seconded employees from domestic organisations including Adnoc, the state renewable energy group Masdar and the foreign ministry.\n\nEdelman said it had supported the announcement of the COP28 presidency and initial rollout: “However, this engagement has concluded.” BCW and FGS declined to comment.\n\nCT Group has also been hired, including the former Downing Street aide to former UK prime minister Boris Johnson who opposed an oil and gas tax, David Canzini, to provide strategic counsel, as previously reported by the Financial Times.\n\nSeparately, a British academic based in Qatar, Marc Owen-Jones, who specialises in online disinformation, has identified at least 100 fake Twitter accounts engaged in a “large, multilingual astroturfing effort” around COP28, that promote UAE foreign policy and burnish its environmental record. Astroturfing is a public-relations campaign that magnifies support for a cause through linked, fictitious accounts.\n\nThe COP28 presidency said these fake bot accounts, which it said it had reported to Twitter, were “generated by outside actors unconnected to COP28 and are clearly designed to discredit COP28 and the climate process”.\n\nJaber has drawn ire from climate campaigners after maintaining that fossil fuel production should not be the focus of the climate summit but rather the control of emissions, either through lower demand or carbon capture and storage technology that allows continued oil and gas use.\n\nThe UAE has also sought to highlight the renewables drive under Jaber’s leadership of Masdar. But its commitments worth $30bn so far compare with the planned $150bn in capital spending as Adnoc seeks to expand oil output capacity in the next five years.\n\nClimate scientists and the International Energy Agency say that a stop to new oil and gas development is required to keep global warming to 1.5C since pre-industrial times. The month of May was the second-hottest globally in 30 years.\n\nIn his latest speech at UN climate talks in Bonn, Germany, Jaber remained consistent in saying that “unabated” fossil fuel production must be phased down — referring to production without the capture of carbon emissions — while renewable energy capacity and energy efficiency was boosted.\n\nHe took an extra step, for the first time adding that the “phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable” but stopped short of a timeline or suggesting a phaseout of production that many countries have sought.\n\nThe UAE’s invitation to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has further sparked discontent in western capitals opposed to his diplomatic rehabilitation.\n\nHosting such a high-profile event has also brought the autocracy’s domestic human rights record under renewed scrutiny. Advocacy groups have called for the release of dozens of political dissidents detained since 2012, many of whom remain imprisoned despite having completed their sentences. The authorities brand the detainees as a terrorist threat, activists have said.\n\nJaber, an engineer by background who is trusted by Abu Dhabi’s leadership as one of its most effective technocrats, is known as being particularly demanding and sensitive to criticism and has a reputation for frequently dispensing with consultants.\n\n“Forget the external challenges and reputational issues, internally COP is a very politically complex space — a client that is very hard to please,” said one communications manager.\n\nExecutives close to the government maintain that the UAE’s convening power across the developing world could combine to forge progress among large polluters.\n\nAbu Dhabi’s pursuit of a multipolar foreign policy, balancing historic security ties with western states alongside newer trade and oil relationships with powers such as China, Russia and India, gives the Gulf monarchy outreach abilities beyond most western democracies, they say.\n\n“A win would be to come out of the summit with a deliverable on financing for the emerging economies, or progress on loss and damage [funding],” said one banker.\n\nIn 2009, the world’s leading economies pledged to raise $100bn a year to finance climate action through an adaptation fund for developing countries, but the annual target has yet to be reached. “They’ll push for the north to pony up on the long-promised $100bn,” said one Abu Dhabi-based executive. “And who knows, they might get it.”",

His leadership, argued more than 100 signatories last week, risked “undermining the negotiations.”\n\nThe letter is the most dramatic example yet of a growing blowback against the COP28 presidency from climate experts, lawmakers and humanitarian groups, who fear that the organising team’s ties to the fossil fuel industry will impede progress at this year’s summit in November.\n\nThe appointment was “a scandal” and a “perfect example of a conflict of interest,” says Michael Bloss, a German member of the European parliament with the Green Party, who signed the letter. “It’s like putting the tobacco industry in charge of ending smoking.”\n\nScientists are clear that reducing the production and use of coal, oil and gas is key to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.\n\nBut Jaber has instead talked about the need to tackle fossil fuel “emissions,” a distinction that analysts says is out of the industry playbook and implied using carbon capture technology, which is unproven at scale, to prolong the use of the polluting fuels.\n\nThe role of COP president is instrumental to the direction and objectives of the annual summit, which brings together world leaders, negotiators, businesses and civil society groups to seek consensus on how to address climate change.\n\nA COP28 that lacks ambition and fails to achieve progress would feed into broader concerns about the effectiveness of the summits, following sustained criticism of COP27 — which more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists registered to attend.\n\nThe deal penned in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, did not include a commitment to phasing down fossil fuels despite broad support for the idea from nations including the EU and US, following pushback from oil producing countries including Saudi Arabia.\n\nExperts say it is too early to write off COP28, but that time is running out for the presidency to win the confidence of the international community and show it has real ambitions to make it a success.\n\nCOP presidencies must be neutral, says Alden Meyer, a senior associate at think-tank E3G: “Can the incoming president and his team rise above UAE’s own interests as a fossil fuels producer? That’s the real question.”\n\nThe announcement of Jaber as COP28 president in January sparked immediate anger from civil society groups, who said it was folly to expect the head of a major oil company to advocate for ambitious climate action. Under Jaber, the Adnoc board last year accelerated plans to increase oil production capacity.\n\nThe Emirates countered that Jaber had been instrumental in guiding the UAE’s adoption of renewables and launching Abu Dhabi’s clean energy company, Masdar, in 2006. Jaber remains the chair of Masdar, which has invested or committed $30bn to renewable power projects across 40 countries. But while Adnoc, which is a shareholder in Masdar, has committed $150bn in capital spending over five years to 2027, only $15bn is earmarked for “low carbon solutions” until 2030.\n\nThe appointment of Jaber was followed by a series of uncomfortable developments, including the news that the UAE had invited the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad to the conference and hired a political adviser from the UK who was opposed to windfall taxes on oil and gas firms to help with communications.\n\nThe louder the criticism gets, however, the more the COP28 team is likely to dig in and go on the defensive, says one person with knowledge of the group, adding that they had been “surprised” by the level of criticism they had received.\n\nThe COP28 team did not comment on whether it considered Jaber’s dual roles a conflict of interests, but noted his 20 years working in the renewable energy sector, his experience in climate diplomacy and his role in “decarbonising, transforming and future proofing Adnoc.”\n\nJaber had this year “consistently called on the oil and gas sector to up its game, do more, and do it faster,” it said, and although “the phaseout of fossil fuels is inevitable . . . this will take time.”\n\nWestern leaders have stood by Jaber, in public at least. The EU’s commissioner for green policy Frans Timmermans and US climate envoy John Kerry each voiced their support for him soon after his appointment. The French diplomat Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Agreement, wrote in May: “Who better than the UAE to demonstrate it is part of the solution? The UAE cannot afford to play it safe.”\n\nBut it is yet to show evidence of significant ambition. COP presidents typically work to build support for their ideas throughout the year, over months of careful diplomacy.\n\nMay’s Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin was expected to be a moment when the COP28 presidency outlined its vision for the summit.\n\nInstead, Jaber told those present that fossil fuels would “continue to play a role in the foreseeable future”, and provided little detail about the team’s plans for the conference.\n\nThat worried some officials, who are looking to the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June — roughly the halfway point to COP — as the next major moment when a blueprint might come.\n\nOne developing country negotiator says it is “key” that the COP28 team set out its vision “before the summer break.”\n\nAlex Scott, E3G’s lead for climate diplomacy, puts it more bluntly: “Jaber has two weeks to save COP28 . . . he needs to arrive in Bonn with a plan of action. It’s vital for his credibility that he meets the challenge and ensures he’s not simply seen as a defender of oil and gas interests.”\n\nCOP28 said the president had “detailed priorities multiple times” after a “listening and engagement tour” this year, including making climate finance more available and tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nOne major focus at COP28 will be the so-called “global stocktake”, when countries will assess progress towards cutting emissions. Another key discussion will be about how a new fund to help pay for the damage done to developing nations by extreme weather events will function. And all eyes will be watching to see whether the final deal includes a commitment to phase down fossil fuels.\n\nBut Jaber’s focus on fossil fuel emissions, and the team’s early plans for a new alliance of oil and gas companies committed to reducing emissions that was widely branded as unambitious, have worried analysts.\n\nThe developing country negotiator said the focus on fossil fuel emissions was “a dangerous distraction.”\n\nMafalda Duarte, the incoming head of the UN’s Green Climate Fund, says Jaber was right about the need to invest in solutions such as clean energy, but questioned the focus on carbon capture technologies: “This is where the scepticism comes in.”\n\nThe need to ramp up renewables, which Jaber has stressed, was only “one side of the equation,” says Meyer. “I think they are trying to avoid having a full-blown commitment to the kind of reduction in fossil fuel production and consumption that we need to see . . . That’s going to lead to a real clash in Dubai.”\n\nBeyond the fossil fuels question, the presidency will have to navigate other difficult challenges, including how to make civil society groups feel comfortable in a country that does not allow protests.\n\nThe summit has brought the UAE’s human rights record under renewed scrutiny. Advocacy groups have called for the release of dozens of dissidents who have been detained since 2012 for demanding political reforms.\n\nThere is also the question of how western diplomats might negotiate being in the same place as the Syrian leader and his representatives, if they choose to attend. The invite, which has been widely criticised, was seen as part of a move by countries in the region to improve relations with a regime under sanctions by the UN and others for its use of chemical weapons and other alleged war crimes and acts of brutality.\n\nHow the COP28 team juggles the competing interests at the summit will be the best test of its commitment to tackling climate change, analysts say — especially as the influence of the regional powerhouse, Saudi Arabia, is expected to weigh heavily on the host.\n\nBut a COP hosted by a petrostate was always going to attract particular scrutiny, experts say. “No matter who they put up for the president, there was going to be a perception of a conflict,” says Meyer. Jaber was “a lightning rod for a much broader critique of the system.”\n\nBehind the scenes, the UN’s climate chief Simon Stiell is working to reform the COP process to make it more transparent. Civil society groups hope changes will include a new conflict of interests policy and rules that would require COP participants to disclose climate-related lobbying.\n\nBut such ideas have been around for years, with little progress made, reportedly as a result of resistance from countries including the US and Australia.\n\nDespite discomfort at the UAE’s hosting in some quarters, no countries are yet talking publicly about boycotting the summit. Representatives of climate vulnerable countries said it was important for them to be present.\n\n“We look forward to being there,” says ambassador Samuelu Laloniu, a special envoy from Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific island at risk from sea level rise. “Our absence from the discussion will not serve the interests of our islands.”\n\nAmbassador Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Pa’olelei Luteru, the Samoan chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, says countries must attend the summit to have “a mature, productive conversation.”\n\n“This is an issue that requires all of us to work together,” he says. “Sometimes it’s perhaps more important to engage with those that do not necessarily share your perspective.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean ignoring the key issues at hand, adds Laloniu. “The only way to keep the [1.5C] target alive is to address the problem at the source,” and fossil fuels are “the culprit here.”\n\nIf western leaders do nothing else, says the Democratic senator Whitehouse, they must maintain close scrutiny of the UAE until November.\n\n“The prudent step,” he says, is to pile on the pressure “to try to create the transparency and the environment where they can’t go easy on the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Simeon Kerr",

    "date": "2023-05-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has invited Bashar al-Assad to attend the COP 28 climate summit in Dubai, the latest move by countries in the region to rehabilitate the Syrian president but one that is likely to cause discomfort for western leaders and climate advocates.\n\nSyria, which was readmitted to the Arab League this month, received the invite from a UAE representative at its embassy in Damascus on Monday, according to the Syrian state news agency.\n\nThe invitation to the gathering later this year will cause disquiet in those countries that have expressed disdain for the pace of reconciliation with the Syrian leader, whose regime was accused of war crimes during the country’s devastating civil war.\n\nIt would be his first global summit since before the outbreak of the war in 2011, and it holds the potential for awkward encounters with western leaders who have sanctioned his regime and called for him to be removed.\n\nThe holding of the UN climate summit in the UAE has been contentious from the outset, after the appointment of the head of the state-owned oil company, Sultan Al Jaber, as president of COP28, and the inclusion of fossil fuel industry leaders as formal participants.\n\n“COP28 is committed to an inclusive COP process that produces transformational solutions,” said a COP 28 spokesperson. “This can only happen if we have everyone in the room.” The meeting would be a “milestone opportunity” to drive progress towards keeping the goals and ambitions of the Paris climate deal alive, the spokesperson added.\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia have been leading Arab efforts to rehabilitate the Syrian regime, which has been able to reassert its control over most of Syria after receiving military backing from Iran and Russia during the civil war.\n\nAlthough Syria’s readmittance to the Arab League is a largely symbolic move, analysts see it as a boost to Assad, whom they believe is seeking rehabilitation on the global stage without having to make significant concessions.\n\nDiplomats said some states — including Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan and Egypt — had previously opposed Syria rejoining the league. Those in opposition believe Assad has done little to rehabilitate himself since the civil war that began when he brutally crushed anti-government protests during the Arab spring uprisings of 2011.\n\nRegional diplomats said more concrete steps were required before most Arab states could support normalising relations with Syria.\n\nThose opposed to Syria’s readmission to the Arab League had wanted the re-engagement to be carried out through a step-by-step process, hoping they could secure commitments from Assad on humanitarian issues, refugees and curbing the illegal trade in narcotics that have become an economic lifeline for Damascus.\n\nWhile Turkey and some Gulf countries sought the overthrow of Assad during the initial stages of the civil war, he was able to regain control of most of the country by 2016 with the support of Moscow and Tehran.\n\nThe rise of Islamist extremist groups in the fight against the regime also raised concerns among some Gulf monarchies, including the UAE, which are opposed to the regional threat posed by political Islam.\n\nThe remnants of the opposition still control north-western pockets of the devastated nation, while US-backed Kurdish militias control the north-east.\n\nThe regime remains under western sanctions and millions of Syrians have been internally displaced or sought refuge in foreign countries. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in the civil war, during which the regime bombed and tortured civilians.",

    "body": "I wasn’t on a mission to find somewhere else to live. But I started to have a yearning for creativity in different forms, and recently I moved to Dubai with my husband, Gary. There’s so much opportunity here. It’s the same feeling I had in New York all those years ago when I was building my first perfume brand. A lot of creatives are moving here at the moment. I’ve been spending time in the arts district – there are all these young entrepreneurial companies starting up, and it reminds me of how east London was 20 years ago. Everyone is bouncing ideas off each other – collaborations are becoming almost a currency here now.\n\nWe already sell my perfume line, Jo Loves, in Dubai, and one of the reasons we came is that it’s a great hub from which to expand to other markets like China, Singapore, Japan and India, as well as the Gulf states. Despite having sold my first perfume company to Estée Lauder more than 30 years ago, and creating Jo Loves in 2009, I’ve always felt there’s another huge “something” I’m meant to do. I still don’t know what it is, but I feel it’s going to happen here.\n\nI think it’s partly because I’m very driven by my senses, and Dubai is a very sensorial city. I would love to build a hotel for the senses. Or create a tapas bar for your sense of smell and taste. You can imagine both of those existing here. There’s no more glorious example of sensory overload than the Spice Souk in the Old Town, which you arrive at in a little boat. As well as being a great way to immerse yourself in the city, for me it’s a huge learning experience because I smell things that I’ve never, ever come across before. New scents just sort of stop me in my tracks, and I’ll have to go and talk to the seller, find out what it is, how it’s made and how it’s used. There are also lots of lovely silk and fabric shops around there. I’ll buy scarves and occasionally have a dress made if I see a fabric I can’t resist. I also love this little place called Al Seef, which they describe as a “heritage village”. It’s been built right on the creek. I’m very drawn to colour, and here everything is terracotta with beautiful turquoise wooden doors. I like to go there and sit and have a coffee. You just feel like you’re part of something.\n\nIf you want to experience something of “new Dubai”, City Walk has just been built. It’s kind of an outside-inside shopping district, very shiny and new but done in quite an elegant way. It’s more than 10mn sq ft, so gives you a sense of the scale of the city, and also its ambition. That’s why I love the Museum of the Future: it’s not about telling you stories from the past. My favourite part is this huge laboratory that’s like something out of a Spielberg movie. I could spend days there.\n\nWhen we first got here, we lived at the One&Only Royal Mirage, which I think has the best spa hammam in Dubai. It’s just total luxury, from the heated marble slab to the traditional black soap cleansing ritual, the Ghassoul clay wrap, the drizzling of the oil and the full body massage. I can’t even describe how clean you feel afterwards.\n\nThe only thing that could possibly bring you back down to earth after that could be the Dubai traffic – it can be as bad as everyone says. You could easily get stuck on the motorway for an hour just travelling between meetings.\n\nTraffic notwithstanding, the best time to visit is probably from September through to April. Spring is when you get the wildflowers in the desert; I can smell them on the air in the mornings. There is also a lovely literary festival in February. One night, we all went into the desert to listen to poetry under the stars, sitting on carpets in front of log fires. There’s something beautiful around every corner. That’s how living in Dubai feels to me.",

    "date": "2023-04-0700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has refused to extradite two members of the Gupta family to face accusations of systematic looting of the South African state over the past decade.\n\nThe denial by a UAE court of the request from South Africa to extradite Atul and Rajesh Gupta, who are wanted by Pretoria for alleged fraud and money laundering and were arrested in the UAE last year, was “shocking” and “inexplicable”, South Africa’s justice minister Ronald Lamola said on Friday.\n\nThe UAE government notified South African authorities on Thursday that the court had ruled in February that the Guptas could not be handed over despite an extradition treaty between the two nations, Lamola added.\n\n“We have complied with every letter of the extradition treaty between ourselves and the UAE . . . that’s why we are bemused by this judgment that cites technicalities,” said Lamola. UAE authorities would have to file any appeal on South Africa’s behalf, he added.\n\nThe refusal deals a major blow to South Africa’s efforts under President Cyril Ramaphosa to seek justice for the country’s biggest post-apartheid scandal — the so-called capture of the state under his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, for the alleged benefit of businesses controlled by the Guptas.\n\nA landmark South African judicial inquiry concluded last year that Zuma “readily opened the doors” for the trio of brothers to loot the Eskom state electricity monopoly, which is now stricken with regular rolling blackouts, and other resources with the connivance of the ruling African National Congress.\n\nThe Guptas fled South Africa and their mining-to-media empire collapsed when Zuma fell from power in 2018. The Guptas and Zuma have always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAtul and Rajesh Gupta were arrested in the UAE in June last year after they were placed on Interpol’s red notice list over a case in South Africa.\n\nAt the time, the arrest was a major boost for the anti-corruption battle under Ramaphosa, which had been making slow progress with prosecutions. South Africa had been seeking the brothers’ extradition since July 2022.\n\nThe UAE said in a statement that the Dubai court of appeal had rejected the extradition request for Atul and Rajesh Gupta because it “did not meet the strict standards for legal documentation” in the extradition treaty.\n\nThe UAE received the extradition file in November after several meetings with South African authorities and the request was referred to public prosecution for investigation, the statement added. After three hearings, the court of appeal decided that the two men could not be handed over.\n\n“At every step, UAE judicial authorities briefed their South African counterparts on proceedings,” the statement said. The South African authorities could resubmit the extradition request, it added.\n\nThe UAE court ruling indicated that the Guptas, who were born in India, are citizens of Vanuatu, the South Pacific island nation, said Lamola. Vanuatu is one of a number of countries that offer so-called golden visas, which provide citizenship in exchange for inward investment.\n\nAfrica Intelligence reported this week that the Guptas had been seen in Switzerland, despite officially being in custody in the UAE. The South African justice ministry said it did not have information on the report.\n\nAtul and Rajesh Gupta could not be reached for comment.",

    "body": "Speakers at a climate and health conference in the United Arab Emirates were told not to protest or “criticise corporations” in a warning that cited the Gulf state’s laws, alarming campaigners ahead of the country hosting the UN’s COP28 climate summit this year.\n\nOrganisers advised panellists at last month’s Forecasting Healthy Futures event in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital and its richest emirate, to “be aware and respectful of UAE laws”, and warned: “Do not criticise Islam, UAE government, corporations or individuals”, and “do not protest”.\n\nThe written guidance, seen by the Financial Times, added: “We understand that climate change can be a controversial subject and we welcome all perspectives and opinions in civil discourse throughout the programme agenda. Protesting is illegal in the United Arab Emirates and any instances of disruptive protesting will be handled by the local authorities.”\n\nClimate activists said the restrictions on free speech raised more questions about the suitability of the oil-rich UAE to host the annual UN climate summit, which will take place in November and December. Top scientists have warned of a “rapidly closing window” to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n“This is deeply concerning,” said Collin Rees, of Oil Change International, a US climate group. “The language circulated here cannot be acceptable at the climate talks. There should be strong pushback on this and the UN should provide as strong a place as possible for the upcoming COP.”\n\nLarge protests are often organised to coincide with the annual climate event, with about 100,000 people taking to the streets of Glasgow on a single day when the UK hosted COP26. Civil society groups critical of fossil fuel companies attend the summit in large numbers.\n\nThe conference on health in the context of climate change was organised by Forecasting Healthy Futures, a group of health and technology organisations convened by Malaria No More.\n\nAccording to the event’s website, seed funding to FHF was provided by Reaching the Last Mile, a public health and development group with ties to UAE president Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan.\n\nForecasting Healthy Futures said the group did not receive “guidance” from Reaching the Last Mile “or any other UAE individual or institution”.\n\nIt added: “In the interest of protecting summit speakers and panellists from any actual or perceived violation of UAE law, and given the expected online coverage of the event, with the potential for misquoting or mischaracterisation, we erred on the side of caution by independently issuing guidance covering the most broad interpretation of UAE’s penal code governing defamation.”\n\nMajid al-Suwaidi, director-general of COP28, gave a keynote speech at the FHF conference, touting the upcoming summit as one that would take an “inclusive” approach to tackling climate change.\n\nLise Masson, climate justice and energy advocacy officer at Friends of the Earth International, said the COP conferences had long suffered from “corporate capture”. “We’re preparing for this COP to be an extreme and intense iteration of something that isn’t new,” she said.\n\nCherelle Blazer, senior director at Sierra Club, a US climate group, said it was “vitally important” that members of civil society groups attended the COP, despite it being held in “a place hostile to protesting”.\n\nThe host nation has already come under scrutiny over its appointment of Sultan al-Jaber, head of Abu Dhabi’s state-owned oil company Adnoc, to the presidency of COP28.\n\nLast year’s COP summit in Egypt ended in disappointment for many, as fossil fuel producing nations including Saudi Arabia blocked a push by others to include in the final deal a promise to phase down all fossil fuels.\n\nA COP28 UAE spokesperson said the conference would “take an inclusive approach that engages all stakeholders from the public and private sectors, civil society, scientific community, women and youth” and “welcome inclusive, constructive dialogues that facilitate consensus-building to drive ambitious climate outcomes”.\n\nThey said organisers would ensure “there are safe spaces where all voices may be heard”.\n\nThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees the summit, said the COP venue would be an “extraterritorial space” managed by the UN.\n\n“The meaningful participation of all actors from society in the UNFCCC process and the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) is an indispensable ingredient for the success of these events,” it said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Camilla Hodgson in London",

Tens of thousands of Russians have settled in the UAE, mainly in Dubai, over the past year in a bid to escape financial restrictions in Europe or to avoid the military draft back home. Many have complained of difficulty in opening bank accounts, especially corporate facilities, at banks already operating in the Gulf state.\n\nUS treasury officials had previously raised concerns about the granting of a banking licence to MTS.\n\nUS president Joe Biden’s administration is also worried that the UAE is becoming a hub for the shipment of items such as electronics that can be repurposed to help Russia’s war effort. US, UK and EU officials visited the Gulf nation last month to raise concerns with Emirati officials.\n\nThe pressure on the UAE over its links to Russians comes as the Gulf state seeks to demonstrate it has tightened financial compliance and boosted criminal enforcement following the global anti-money laundering watchdog’s decision a year ago to place it on its so-called “grey list”.\n\nUAE officials have said they have taken many steps to address the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force’s concerns.\n\nThe Gulf state is a traditional western ally but in recent years it has sought to boost relations with other world powers, including Russia and China, as it has become frustrated with the US’s perceived disengagement from the Middle East.\n\nDubai is the region’s premier trade, finance and tourism hub and has long been the destination of choice for international banks and multinationals operating in the Middle East.",

    "body": "Sheikh Khaled bin Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan had a hectic agenda in the weeks before he was named Abu Dhabi’s new crown prince.\n\nAmong other duties, he hosted Microsoft’s president and the chief executive of IBM, inaugurated a new port district, attended a government leadership retreat and visited the joint operations command of the United Arab Emirates’ defence ministry.\n\nAll were evidence of the increasingly prominent role that Sheikh Khaled has taken in recent years, one that fuelled chatter that his father, UAE president and Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, was grooming his eldest son to be heir apparent.\n\nBut such is the intrigue around opaque Gulf palace politics that until his appointment was announced on Wednesday, speculation was rife about whether Sheikh Khaled, 43, would become crown prince or whether Sheikh Mohammed, known as MBZ, would opt for one of his more experienced brothers, particularly Sheikh Tahnoon, the UAE’s powerful national security adviser.\n\nMBZ, who last year succeeded his late brother, Sheikh Khalifa, will hope the appointment ends talk of potential power struggles within his ruling family and projects stability and continuity in the oil-rich capital and leader of the seven-emirate federation, analysts say.\n\n“[The UAE] is a rising power in the Middle East and if there was any question as to who is taking responsibility for maybe the next 50 years this clears it up,” Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati professor of politics, said. “Even before his father was president, everybody knew Sheikh Khaled was being given more and more responsibility.”\n\nSheikh Khaled’s rise through the ranks has stretched across key sectors of the economy, security and energy. A graduate of Georgetown university, he is a deputy national security adviser and chair of the executive committee of state oil company Adnoc. He is also a member of the powerful Supreme Council for Financial and Economic Affairs, and was this month appointed to the board of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia), the $790bn sovereign wealth fund.\n\nHe now replaces his father as chair of Abu Dhabi’s executive council, in effect the emirate’s cabinet, of which he has also been a member for several years.\n\n“He’s seen as a serious and sharp individual,” said Taufiq Rahim, a senior fellow at the New America think-tank. “The question will be how soon he will assert more influence in Abu Dhabi’s key institutions.”\n\nMBZ was during his 18 years as crown prince often seen as the chief executive driving Abu Dhabi’s development, to Sheikh Khalifa’s chairman.\n\nAfter Sheikh Khalifa suffered a stroke in 2014, MBZ became de facto leader, overseeing a more assertive foreign policy that led to interventions in conflicts in Yemen and Libya, as well as a crackdown on dissent and the use of Abu Dhabi’s oil riches to raise its profile overseas.\n\nThe 62-year-old leader is expected to rule for years to come. But the appointment of the crown prince, as well as other changes to top posts, reflected a devolving of some power as he focused on the presidency, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n“One thing you can draw from some of the recent announcements — this is essentially the end of one transition and the beginning of another,” said a person close to Abu Dhabi’s leadership.\n\nKey among those who have been elevated are some of MBZ’s full brothers, known collectively as the “Bani Fatima six”, in reference to their mother.\n\nFor the first time, Abu Dhabi has two deputy rulers after MBZ on Wednesday named Sheikh Tahnoon and Sheikh Hazza, another full brother, to the newly created positions. Some believe they will be ceremonial posts, others say it is a sign of MBZ spreading leadership duties.\n\nIn a surprise move, MBZ also appointed another full brother, Sheikh Mansour, who has served as the UAE’s deputy prime minister and owns Manchester City football club, as a vice-president of the Gulf state.\n\nThat means he will work alongside his father-in-law, Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also a vice-president and prime minister of the UAE.\n\nAnalysts say the creation of a second vice-president suggests a further consolidation of Abu Dhabi’s dominance in the federation. But it could also ease some of the federal burdens on Dubai’s septuagenarian leader.\n\nOther high profile changes this month have included Sheikh Tahnoon taking over as chair of Adia, which further expanded his muscular portfolio. He already chairs ADQ, another state investment fund, First Abu Dhabi Bank, the nation’s largest lender, and International Holding Company, a conglomerate that has risen from obscurity to boast a market capitalisation of about $236bn.\n\nSheikh Mansour has also replaced MBZ as chair of Mubadala, another of Abu Dhabi’s investment vehicles, which manages assets of about $284bn.\n\nSome view the string of changes as part of a balancing act MBZ has had to play within the ruling family.\n\n“He’s balancing between empowering his son as crown prince, but also giving additional responsibilities to his brothers who may have seen themselves as part of the succession plan,” said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nOthers believe MBZ is spreading responsibility among trusted lieutenants as the UAE’s ambitions grow. David Roberts, a Gulf expert at King’s College London, called the raft of changes a “nice housekeeping exercise”.\n\n“The long term history of [succession in Gulf monarchies] has been incredibly tricky, so there always needs to be a process of clarity about who goes where,” Roberts said.\n\n“The UAE is evolving in so many ways, economically and politically, that evolving its governance structure seems quite logical for a state that has grown exponentially in recent years.”",

    "date": "2023-03-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, has named his eldest son crown prince of Abu Dhabi as part of a series of changes to the oil-rich Gulf state’s top leadership.\n\nThe appointment of Sheikh Khaled as heir apparent was widely expected as he has taken on more prominent roles in recent years and it will end speculation about the succession, particularly the potential for a power struggle.\n\nSheikh Mohammed also promoted three of his full brothers, naming Sheikh Tahnoon, who is the UAE’s national security adviser and also oversees a sprawling business empire, and Sheikh Hazza, who is deputy chair of Abu Dhabi’s powerful executive council, as deputy rulers of the emirate.\n\nSheikh Mansour, the UAE’s deputy prime minister and best known outside the Gulf for owning English football club Manchester City, was appointed vice-president of the state. That will mean he will serve alongside Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, the prime minister and the ruler of Dubai.\n\nThe changes come almost a year after Sheikh Mohammed, known as MBZ, became president of the UAE, a federation of seven emirates, and the ruler of Abu Dhabi after the death of his half brother, Sheikh Khalifa.\n\nMBZ had already been the Gulf state’s de facto leader for almost a decade as Sheikh Khalifa’s health declined, and he is regarded as one of the Arab world’s most influential leaders. The UAE has pursued an assertive foreign policy under his watch.\n\nSanam Vakil, director of the Middle East programme at think-tank Chatham House, said MBZ had “formalised multiple appointments to show confidence and capacity”.\n\n“The moves also institutionalise a succession process which is important to build confidence about the UAE’s continuity and governance model,” she said.\n\nThe appointments cement the influence of MBZ and his five full brothers, known as the “Bani Fatima six”, in reference to their mother.\n\nSheikh Khaled, the crown prince, is in his early 40s and was educated in the US before starting his formal government career within the security services. He has taken on increasingly senior posts in recent years and is a member of Abu Dhabi’s executive council, the capital’s top decision-making body, and chair of the Abu Dhabi executive office.\n\nHis public profile has also been raised as he has inaugurated projects, hosted chief executives of multinational companies and met foreign dignitaries.\n\nSigns of changes to senior positions came earlier this month when Sheikh Tahnoon was named chair of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia) the emirate’s $790bn sovereign wealth fund, replacing the late Sheikh Khalifa.\n\nHe was already one of the UAE’s most influential figures and chairs ADQ, a state investment company, First Abu Dhabi Bank, the country’s largest lender, and International Holding Company, a listed conglomerate that has a market capitalisation of about $236bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Sheikh Mansour replaced MBZ this month as chair of Mubadala, one of Abu Dhabi’s most active state investment funds, which manages assets of about $284bn.\n\nGulf experts said those moves were a sign of MBZ stepping back from some of his roles as he settles into the presidency and elevates his most trusted lieutenants.\n\nAbu Dhabi is by far the most powerful of the seven emirates that make up the federation, each with its own ruling family, and it steers the UAE’s foreign and defence policies.\n\nMBZ’s appointments come at a time when Abu Dhabi is enjoying a petrodollar windfall from last year’s oil boom and is becoming an increasingly active global investor through its stable of sovereign wealth funds.",

    "blurb": "Frenzy of activity across the region contrasts sharply with Europe’s moribund market",
    "date": "2023-03-2800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Shares in Presight AI, a data analytics company, soared on Monday, their first day of trading on the Abu Dhabi bourse after a $496mn initial public offering that was 136 times oversubscribed.\n\nThe demand is no one-off. It comes two weeks after Adnoc Gas raised $2.5bn in the emirate’s biggest listing. They are among the latest in a fast-flowing pipeline of offerings in the Middle East that contrasts sharply with Europe’s moribund market.\n\nThe 51 IPOs across the Middle East and north Africa last year was a record, according to EY. They raised $22bn, a 179 per cent increase on 2021, the advisory firm said, adding that this year’s market looked “healthy”.\n\nMiguel Azevedo, Citigroup’s chair of investment banking for the Middle East and Africa, said the region had “come on to the radar screen”.\n\n“Lots of people moved here after Covid and there were lots of IPOs here, so it forced the world to look at the region, which has grabbed attention when there was nothing going on in the rest of the world,” he said.\n\nFinancial regulatory reform, a privatisation push amid political stability and oil and gas prices that have risen significantly from their Covid-19 pandemic lows are driving both the IPO frenzy and private deals, bankers said.\n\n“The constant state of turmoil has calmed down and oil prices are higher than break-even [for governments],” said Sammy Kayello, a senior adviser at Morgan Stanley.\n\nSaudi Arabia is revamping its oil-reliant economy under its ambitious crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The United Arab Emirates has attracted financial groups to its commercial centre in Dubai and launched a dizzying number of listings in the oil-rich capital of Abu Dhabi. And tiny Qatar, buzzing from its successful hosting of the football World Cup, is doubling gas exports.\n\nPrivate capital fund managers deployed $19.8bn in 191 Middle East deals last year, the only place in the world to post a year-on-year increase in investment value in 2022, according to the Global Private Capital Association. In 2018, $600mn was invested.\n\nThe combination of regulatory reform and high oil prices has been most keenly felt in the Saudi stock market, with the standout deal being the 2019 $29bn listing of oil supermajor Saudi Aramco.\n\nThis kick-started a surge of IPOs, with 2022 marking a record year. Over the past five years, market capitalisation has surged about 475 per cent. The market regulator said there were now 269 listed companies compared with 188 at the end of 2017, with another 80 preparing to float.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, the national oil company has floated a series of assets, fostering a similar surge of listings.\n\nFast food operator Americana, owned by the Saudi sovereign Public Investment Fund and Dubai businessman Mohamed Alabbar, listed on both Abu Dhabi and Riyadh exchanges in December amid surging demand.\n\n“It’s the same playbook from Europe — in the UK it was the mid to late ’80s with the privatisation drive that encouraged activity,” said a senior US-based capital markets banker. “It helped stimulate markets and promote more of an equity culture and encourage private enterprise to come public.”\n\nDubai’s successful handling of the pandemic lured crypto billionaires and financial executives who took advantage of its open economy. Many have put down roots, persuading their firms to follow.\n\nHedge funds and asset managers, including Brevan Howard and ExodusPoint, have set up in the city’s financial district, which is now in talks to license another 50 hedge funds as managers eye the tax-free sun and advantageous trading window spanning Asia and the US.\n\n“International investors are coming — big, proper grown-up and respected long-only asset managers in the US and Europe investing with their own people to get ready to make more investments in that world [the Gulf],” said another US investment banker.\n\nDubai, having seen its neighbours’ capital markets go into overdrive, last year embarked on its own privatisation campaign, pledging to list 10 state-related entities. Four have already been listed, including utility Dewa and road-toll company Salik.\n\nAzevedo said the region was moving into a “second phase” of listings, with “non-government entities IPO-ing in the UAE, both Dubai and Abu Dhabi”. “This year will see a few family-owned companies coming through,” he added.\n\nFamily-owned businesses make up as much as 90 per cent of the private sectors in countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. As founders die, their heirs often fall into recriminations. Going public is a means of imposing corporate governance and succession-planning arrangements to avoid familial strife.\n\nAl Ansari Financial Services, a family-owned company and the UAE’s largest exchange house chain, on Monday raised $210mn amid strong demand for its IPO on Dubai’s stock market. Other regional family-owned groups mature enough to list shares publicly include Dubai-based malls conglomerate Majid Al Futtaim, Lebanese-owned retailer Azadea and Abu Dhabi hypermarket chain Lulu.\n\nAzevedo predicted these would be followed by a third wave of “young fintech firms and tech-enabled companies that have been raising money in the private capital market”.\n\nPotential candidates include ag-tech company Pure Harvest, cloud kitchen platform Kitopi and classified advertising firm Dubizzle, bankers say.\n\nRecent banking collapses in the US and Europe are reviving concerns about a repeat of the global financial crisis, when the Middle East was booming as the rest of the world went into financial meltdown.\n\nAt the time, the Gulf boasted that it had “decoupled” from the global economy before crashing into its own debt and oil price crisis of 2009.\n\n“It’s slightly different now because of the stronger balance sheets and the ongoing transformation programmes,” said Tarek Fadlallah, chief executive of Nomura Asset Management, Middle East. “During the GFC, oil prices fell sharply and a big difference this time is that prices remain within a comfort zone.”",

    "blurb": "Trip by Ali Shamkhani follows China-brokered deal between the Islamic republic and Saudi Arabia",
    "date": "2023-03-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Iran’s top security official, Ali Shamkhani, will travel to the United Arab Emirates for talks on Thursday, in the latest sign of improving relations between the Islamic republic and Gulf states.\n\nThe trip comes after Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed last week to restore diplomatic ties within two months, putting an end to a seven-year rift. The agreement between the rival Middle East powers was part of a China-brokered deal signed by Shamkhani and his Saudi counterpart in Beijing.\n\nShamkhani had extra credibility as a regional dealmaker because Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appointed him secretary of the powerful Supreme National Security Council, according to analysts in the country.\n\n“The fact that Shamkhani is directly involved in such talks shows the Islamic republic is determined to improve its ties with the Arab states” in the Gulf, said Saeed Laylaz, an Iranian political analyst. He added that Shamkhani’s priorities at the UAE talks should be to end the nine-year Yemen conflict and ease the transfer of foreign currencies into Iran. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have led the military intervention into Yemen.\n\nNournews, affiliated to Iran’s leading security organisation, said the Abu Dhabi trip was in response to a visit by the UAE national security adviser, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, to Iran in late 2021.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon also made a secret visit to Iran in 2019 to help ease tensions between the two neighbours after an attack on oil tankers off the coast of UAE that the US blamed on Iran. The attack raised fears in Abu Dhabi that Tehran could target the UAE, a US ally, in revenge for crippling sanctions imposed by then US president Donald Trump.\n\nDrone strikes on Abu Dhabi last year, claimed by Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen, highlighted its vulnerability to attacks. The Gulf state, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020, has also been keen to distance itself from any potential military action taken by the Jewish state against Iran.\n\nNournews said senior economic, banking and security officials would accompany Shamkhani for talks that would encompass bilateral, regional and international issues. Iran has, according to analysts, over the past decade used businesses in the commercial centres of the UAE to circumvent debilitating sanctions imposed by the US in response to Iran’s nuclear programme.\n\nThe UAE has been among Iran’s top trading partners for decades even during difficult times between the two states. Tehran’s latest official figures showed $13.6bn worth of goods were imported to Iran through the Gulf state, which accounted for almost 31 per cent of all imports during the first 10 months of the Iranian year that ends next week.\n\nRelations between the UAE and Iran deteriorated after Iranian vigilantes attacked the Saudi embassy in Tehran in 2016 to protest against the kingdom’s execution of a senior Shia cleric. The UAE responded by recalling its ambassador in Tehran. Last year it restored full diplomatic relations after a tentative rapprochement.\n\nTehran’s latest diplomatic moves have raised hopes among many Iranians and the country’s business community that the country’s hardline leaders might be preparing for a revival of the 2015 nuclear accord with global powers. But despite the thawing of regional relations there has been no strong signal from the Iranian leadership that it was ready to return to the nuclear deal. Trump exited the accord in 2018.\n\nLaylaz said Iran had “no choice but to eventually make concessions with the US as both have reached a dead end in dealing with each other.” He added that “for now, Iranians feel relieved that some progress is happening in foreign policy.”",

He assumed the presidency on the death last year of their half-brother Sheikh Khalifa, who used to chair Adia.\n\nFourth-quarter profit almost doubled from Dh4.3bn in 2021 to Dh8.3bn in the same period last year, which the company said had been derived from positive business performance despite unfavourable global conditions. Revenues for the year grew 78 per cent to Dh50.9bn, down from the 305 per cent increase recorded in 2021.\n\n“The external environment we faced was mixed in some of the key markets. However, our strategy . . . aligns us with the major engines of global growth and we see strong progress across our strategic businesses,” said Syed Basar Shueb, IHC’s chief executive.\n\nIHC’s investment highlights include a 50 per cent stake in Turkish energy company Kalyon and a Dh734mn investment into the Colombian neobank Lulo.\n\nThe firm also invested Dh7.35bn into three portfolio companies of India’s Adani group, which has been accused of fraud and stock market manipulation by a US short seller. Adani has denied the claims.\n\nIHC’s total assets increased 156 per cent from Dh89bn at the end of 2021 to Dh282bn at the end of 2022.\n\nThe number of IHC subsidiaries rose from 302 in 2021 to 482 and 41 joint ventures and associates in 2022, spanning 20 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. The conglomerate focuses on nine segments, including energy, food, health, real estate and leisure.\n\nIHC said it would target expansion in 2023 across sectors such as utilities, food and technology.\n\n“We are looking forward to the opportunities that 2023 will bring as we remain committed to deliver stronger financial performance in the next few months,” Shueb said.\n\nThis article has been corrected as IHC invested Dh7.35bn into three portfolio companies of India’s Adani group, not Dh735bn",

IHC is a listed group linked to the ruling family that has undergone an astonishing rise to become the region’s second-largest company by market capitalisation after the oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nHe replaces as chair of Adia the late Sheikh Khalifa, the former UAE president, who died last year and was succeeded by Sheikh Tahnoon’s brother, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The new president has yet to name an heir.\n\nAdia, established in 1976, has for decades invested in overseas capital markets, becoming one of the region’s most important sources of funding for global asset managers. It has also branched out into asset classes such as private equity, real estate and infrastructure.\n\nThe sovereign wealth fund acts as a vehicle to deploy excess hydrocarbon revenues to deliver long-term returns for the government.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon has increasingly risen to prominence, dealing with sensitive foreign policy issues as national security adviser. These have included repairing relations with Qatar and Turkey, with which the UAE clashed during the Arab Spring, while also trying to keep a lid on tensions with regional rival Iran.\n\nHis longstanding interests as a domestic and global investor have also stood out. IHC, a listed vehicle that emerged from the private Royal Group, which Sheikh Tahnoon has long controlled, has perplexed bankers with its surge on Abu Dhabi’s stock exchange over the past few years. ADQ has also become one of the most active investors in regional markets.\n\nHis elevation comes as Abu Dhabi, buoyed by high oil prices, has cemented its role as one of the few global locations of excess capital. Bankers and companies have been attracted to the UAE’s capital to raise funds.\n\nBut the UAE, like other Gulf states, is also seeking to reinvest revenues domestically. The country is trying to adapt its oil-reliant economy for a post-oil future, as well as taking greater control over how its capital is deployed overseas.\n\nEarlier this week, ADQ and IHC, both chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon, teamed up with General Atlantic to launch a global asset management firm based in Abu Dhabi.",

    "event_name": "General Atlantic, IHC and Abu Dhabi fund team up on investment firm",
    "blurb": "Proposed firm will manage assets for two state-backed funds and International Holding Company",
    "date": "2023-03-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Private equity firm General Atlantic is teaming up with an Abu Dhabi state fund and the emirate’s largest listed company to launch a new investment group, underlining the continuing pull the oil-rich Gulf state holds for Wall Street.\n\nThe new investment firm will manage a series of assets drawn from ADQ, Abu Dhabi Growth Fund and International Holding Company, a once small company that now dominates the emirate’s stock exchange after four years of explosive share price growth.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, ADQ and IHC said that the firm is expected to manage money that they, as well as another sovereign fund ADG, had earmarked for alternative assets, including private equity, venture capital and credit.\n\nThe plan “demonstrates our intention to create the largest independent alternative investment manager from the region,” said Mohamed Alsuwaidi, ADQ’s chief executive.\n\nGeneral Atlantic, which has previously invested in tech companies including Alibaba and Airbnb, will be a “strategic investor and partner” to the new firm, the statement said, without giving further details.\n\nThe name of the firm and the scale of the assets it will manage were not disclosed, but its structure reflects the blurred lines between state and private assets in Abu Dhabi.\n\nADQ and IHC, a listed business linked to Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, are chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE’s powerful national security adviser and a brother of the country’s president.\n\nADQ is an increasingly active state vehicle, aiming to invest primarily in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. IHC, meanwhile, has enjoyed a stunning increase in market value that has puzzled bankers in the region. IHC has said much of the increase in value stems from the transfer of assets from Royal Group, another Abu Dhabi conglomerate.\n\nBuoyed by high commodity prices and determined to diversify their oil-reliant economies, Gulf states have been a magnet for Wall Street firms.\n\nAlongside ADQ, IHC and ADG, the new firm also aims to manage capital from third parties, such as institutional investors and family offices. Based in Abu Dhabi, the firm eventually intends to manage offices in North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nWilliam Ford, the chief executive and chair of General Atlantic, said that the new firm will “play an important role in strengthening Abu Dhabi’s position as an emerging global financial centre.”\n\nNew York-based General Atlantic, which manages $72bn in assets, tends to take minority stakes in privately held companies, in contrast to rivals such as Blackstone and KKR who are best known for taking publicly traded companies private.\n\nGeneral Atlantic has been quick to expand its overall investment platform in recent years. Last October, it acquired a credit investment manager and launched its own lending business, called General Atlantic Credit. It has also targeted fast growth in the Middle East, where it aims to draw in new assets and uncover investments.",

    "body": "The US has launched a renewed crackdown on countries and individuals helping the Kremlin evade western sanctions amid growing fears Russia is fuelling the war in Ukraine by funnelling imports through countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.\n\nThe push by the US Treasury, commerce and justice departments, details of which were first obtained by the Financial Times, comes as western allies increasingly believe Turkey and the UAE, as well as countries in central Asia and the Caucasus, have emerged as the weak links in their efforts to isolate Russia both economically and militarily.\n\n“Those who attempt to prop up Putin’s war machine by evading our export controls and sanctions will be held accountable,” Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement, said in a statement.\n\nElizabeth Rosenberg, the assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, said on Thursday that the UAE was a “country of focus” for the US.\n\nRosenberg said UAE companies exported more than $18mn worth of goods to “US-designated Russian entities” between July and November of 2022. She added that $5mn of that was “US-origin, US-export controlled goods to Russia”, including “semiconductor devices, some of which can be used on the battlefield”.\n\n“These types of figures are the basis for our engagement with the private sector, so that we can clarify the consequences of violating sanctions and export controls, discuss high-risk activity, and act when necessary,” she said.\n\nAs part of their effort, the three US agencies issued a “compliance note” on the “use of third-party intermediaries or transshipment points to evade Russian- and Belarusian-related sanctions and export controls”.\n\nThis includes a list of “red flags” businesses should be looking out for in terms of potential sanctions evasion, singling out specific states including China, Armenia, Turkey and Uzbekistan that western allies say are commonly used as “transshipment points” in order to “illegally redirect restricted items to Russia or Belarus”.\n\n“The UAE recognises its critical role in safeguarding the integrity of the global financial system,” an official from the Gulf state said. “The UAE takes this responsibility extremely seriously, and has clear and robust processes in place to deal with sanctioned entities.”\n\nIn her remarks, Rosenberg cited the steps taken by the west to impose financial and economic penalties on Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but said Moscow would keep looking for “ways to work around our measures”.\n\n“The coming year will be about ensuring that our sanctions architecture is fully enforced and effective — in particular, by figuring out and cracking down on the ways Russia evades sanctions.”\n\nRosenberg added that the US and its allies were engaged in a “broad campaign” to crack down on such behaviour. “We are specifically concerned about increases in trade with Russia in the kind of goods that can be used on the battlefield and those who are aiding designated Russian entities. We are investigating this type of assistance at the individual, firm and sector level.”\n\nIn their compliance note to businesses, the US agencies said other red flags for sanctions evasion included the use of shell companies for international wire transfers, last-minute changes to shipping instructions, the use of personal rather than company email addresses, and transactions with entities with little or no online presence.\n\nThe note also cited previous examples in which the justice department brought criminal charges for the evasion of sanctions and export controls.",

    "date": "2023-03-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Western allies are pushing the United Arab Emirates to halt exports of critical goods to Russia as they seek to starve Vladimir Putin’s military of components to sustain its war against Ukraine.\n\nOfficials from the US, EU and UK have in recent weeks visited the wealthy Gulf state to spell out the wide-ranging scope of their trade restrictions, and to press UAE officials to clamp down on suspected sanctions busting, according to people involved in the trips.\n\nThe US government is worried the UAE is becoming a hub for the shipment of items such as electronics that can be repurposed to help Russia’s war effort. One particular concern, according to people familiar with the discussions, is so-called “re-exporting”, where goods are routed through the UAE to sidestep restrictions.\n\nJames O’Brien, head of the US office of sanctions co-ordination, joined EU sanctions envoy David O’Sullivan, and David Reed, director of the UK’s sanctions directorate, on a visit to the UAE last month to press their case. “Our main request [to the UAE] is that they stop the re-exports [and] acknowledge these re-exports are problematic,” said a western official, adding that “conversations are continuing”.\n\nExports of electronic parts from the UAE to Russia jumped more than seven-fold last year to almost $283mn, making the category the largest type of product shipped in that direction, according to Russian customs data analysed by the Free Russia Foundation.\n\nThe UAE exported 15 times more microchips to Russia in 2022 than a year previously, with trade in the products jumping to $24.3mn last year from $1.6mn in 2021. The Gulf country also exported 158 drones to Russia last year, worth almost $600,000, according to the data.\n\nThe discussions with the UAE come as western allies shift their focus from unleashing fresh rounds of sanctions to tightening enforcement and encouraging private sector compliance.\n\nO’Sullivan told the Financial Times last month that western countries had picked up “unusual spikes” in Russia’s trade with some states, while declining to name specific countries. The allies are watching the UAE, Turkey and countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus. The UAE is also seen as a favoured destination for wealthy Russians seeking a place to shelter their assets.\n\nUS officials want to underline the potential consequences for businesses involved in facilitating the flow of goods that can be used by the Russian military.\n\n“Part of the message for the private sector — in any of these countries — is that they’re playing roulette,” O’Brien said. “Anyone who’s trading in these goods, they now are subject to sanctions because some of the goods they ship are showing up on the battlefield.”\n\nThe UAE positions itself as a neutral regional power, balancing its close security and historical relations with western partners with increasingly close ties with military and economic powers such as Russia and China.\n\nDubai has long been the region’s re-export hub; its Jebel Ali port remains one of the world’s largest transshipment zones. In an attempt to tighten enforcement on such export hubs, the EU introduced new measures late last year enabling it to sanction individuals who help European companies evade sanctions.\n\nAmong Europe’s requests is for improved information on what the UAE actually exports to Russia, amid complaints about a lack of visibility.\n\n“The UAE recognises its critical role in safeguarding the integrity of the global financial system,” a UAE official said. “The UAE takes this responsibility extremely seriously, and has clear and robust processes in place to deal with sanctioned entities.”\n\nWally Adeyemo, deputy US Treasury secretary, warned in a speech last week of “troubling patterns in several countries” where the Kremlin had “deepened its financial ties and trade flows”. He added that the US and its partners would act with “various economic tools” if countries were unwilling to “stamp out sanctions evasion”. Brian Nelson, the US Treasury’s under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, also visited the UAE last month.\n\nTens of thousands of Russians have moved to the UAE, opening companies and buying properties in the Gulf’s commercial and tourist hub. The influx has raised concerns in western countries that some could be masking the involvement of sanctioned oligarchs.\n\nThe UAE, which has approved a licence for Russian bank MTS, said it was studying options after the lender was hit with sanctions by the US and UK last month.",

    "body": "Two Abu Dhabi state funds mired in the 1MDB financial fraud have agreed a $1.8bn settlement with the Malaysian sovereign fund and the ministry of finance to end a legal dispute in London.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement announced on Monday, the International Petroleum Investment Company (Ipic) and Aabar will pay the agreed sum in three phases: $800mn within seven days of the termination of London proceedings and the remainder within two years. Executives at the Abu Dhabi firms were accused of facilitating the looting of billions of dollars from the Malaysian fund.\n\nIn 2018, Malaysia brought the proceedings to challenge a settlement made with the capital of the United Arab Emirates a year earlier when Najib Razak, the former premier at the heart of the 1MDB scandal, was still in office.\n\nThe 1MDB scandal, which saw billions of dollars siphoned from the Malaysian sovereign fund, has reverberated around the world, leading to the ousting of Najib as prime minister and triggering a series of cases, including against Goldman Sachs.\n\nNajib was sentenced to 12 years in jail in 2020 after the Kuala Lumpur high court found him guilty on seven charges, including money laundering and abuse of power, in a high-profile case relating to the 1MDB embezzlement. The ruling was upheld by the supreme court last year.\n\nIn London, Malaysia had argued that the original Abu Dhabi settlement had been concluded to conceal Najib’s “fraud and dishonesty”.\n\nThe settlement draws a line under a longstanding dispute launched five years ago by Malaysia over 1MDB.\n\nThe scandal has been an embarrassment for Abu Dhabi, which in 2016 announced that Ipic and Aabar would be folded into Mubadala, another state investment firm. Mubadala declined to comment.\n\nKhadem al-Qubaisi and Mohammed al-Husseiny, two senior executives at Ipic and Aabar, have been convicted and jailed in Abu Dhabi for their role in the fraud.\n\nThe Malaysian finance ministry said: “With this settlement, Malaysia and Abu Dhabi look forward to continue working together for the prosperity and economic benefit of both countries in the future.”\n\nZafrul Aziz, minister of international trade and industry, who led the negotiations, said in a tweet: “The close relationship between YDPA [the king of Malaysia] and president of UAE was also a significant factor in ensuring the success of the negotiations.”\n\nThe deal comes days after Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, voted into power in November, delivered a record budget of RM388bn.\n\nAnwar, who has also taken on the role of finance minister, inherited an economy still weighed down by the 1MDB scandal.\n\nOne of his biggest challenges is to restore Malaysia’s international reputation following the long-running corruption scandal. The fund remains the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in multiple countries.\n\nAnwar has also put pressure on US investment bank Goldman Sachs Group to honour its settlement amount to the government over its role in the scandal.",

    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has approved a licence for Russia’s MTS Bank, a move that risks exacerbating concerns among western nations over the emergence of the Gulf state as a potential financial haven for Moscow.\n\nOfficials and executives briefed on the matter said the decision by the central bank to issue the banking licence to the lender, which is not subject to western sanctions, would meet growing demand for financial services from Russian expatriates. “It’s all about the business case [and] the number of Russians living here now,” said one person briefed on the decision.\n\nTens of thousands of Russians have settled in the UAE, mainly in Dubai, in the 12 months since the Ukraine invasion to escape financial restrictions in Europe or avoid the military draft back home. Many have complained of difficulty in opening bank accounts, especially corporate facilities, at those lenders already operating in the country. The Russian lender is the first foreign bank in several years to receive a licence in the UAE.\n\nThe US and European nations have become concerned about the UAE’s financial interaction with Russia since sanctions were ramped up after the invasion. Brian Nelson, US Treasury under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, raised the issue of the Russian bank’s licence on a visit to Abu Dhabi last week. “[He] conveyed broad concerns about financial connectivity with Russia, even via non-sanctioned banks,” said a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nNelson met with government counterparts and financial institutions to convey the US’s determination to enforce its sanctions aggressively, according to a Treasury statement ahead of his trip. “Permissive jurisdictions” risk losing access to developed markets for conducting business with sanctioned entities or failing to carry out effective due diligence, the statement added.\n\nMTS Bank, a subsidiary of Russia’s largest mobile operator, and the UAE central bank declined to comment.\n\nThe development comes at a sensitive time for the UAE, which was last year placed under enhanced supervision by the Financial Action Task Force, the global anti money-laundering watchdog. The Middle East’s financial hub has hoped to demonstrate that it has tightened financial compliance and boosted criminal enforcement sufficiently to come off the FATF’s so-called grey list. A decision is set to be made later in February.\n\nThe presence of assets, such as yachts, belonging to sanctioned Russian oligarchs have raised concerns about deeper illicit financial links between the UAE and Russia.\n\nAbu Dhabi officials have rejected these concerns, saying it endeavours to halt financial flows from sanctioned Russian entities while refusing to discriminate against non-sanctioned companies and individuals.\n\nThe authorities urge financial institutions to enforce western sanctions to reduce the risk of losing correspondent banking relationships with US and European lenders.\n\nThe Gulf state, frustrated at a perception of the US’s detachment from the Middle East, has been rebalancing its relations towards a multipolar world view that includes Russia, which has engaged aggressively in the region, as well as China, a growing trading and investment partner.\n\nOne person briefed on the MTS’s operations said the licence would ease access to bank accounts for Russians and open a new channel for the flow of money into the UAE.\n\nIlya Filatov, the bank’s chair, visited the UAE last week as the lender prepared to roll out its services in the coming months, the person said.\n\nRumours of the bank’s imminent arrival have spread in the UAE’s Russian community. “Everyone is trying to track them down here,” said one banker. “This is going to be a game-changer.”",

    "date": "2023-02-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Abu Dhabi’s stock market was long viewed as a minor Gulf exchange, garnering little attention outside the region — a reflection of the relatively small private sector in the oil-rich emirate that has long been dominated by the state.\n\nBut in less than four years its market capitalisation has almost quintupled to more than $650bn, a surge largely driven by the extraordinary rise of one stock — International Holding Company.\n\nChaired by one of the United Arab Emirates’ most powerful figures, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, IHC has been transformed from a $200mn firm with interests in fish farms and real estate into a conglomerate with more than 400 subsidiaries and a market capitalisation of $236bn — bigger than Walt Disney, McDonald’s or L’Oréal.\n\nIts weight rises to $324bn, or half the market, when combined with eight listed subsidiaries, including the $65bn Alpha Dhabi.\n\nThe transformation has mystified bankers and analysts, who have raised concerns about transparency and the blurring of the private sector, the state and the ruling family at a time when Abu Dhabi is seeking to use its oil windfall to burnish its credentials as regional finance hub.\n\n“Five years ago the ADX’s biggest caps — then First Abu Dhabi Bank and Etisalat — were known to be transparent,” said one market analyst. “Now [two of] the largest stocks, IHC and Alpha Dhabi, are black holes . . . the market is less transparent than it was.”\n\nEven the dynamics of the brokerages trading on the ADX have been upended, with another IHC-owned company, International Securities, now accounting for more than half the value of the market’s trades.\n\nIHC’s expansion “seems to be a substantial step back in an institutional environment that previously seemed to become somewhat more transparent in the context of the region’s broader competition for foreign direct investment,” said one western academic who has advised Gulf governments on governance issues.\n\nDespite being the largest and third-largest companies on the ADX by market value, neither IHC nor Alpha Dhabi are included in MSCI’s UAE index. MSCI’s criteria for including a stock in an index focuses not only on size but also the degree to which a company’s shares are freely available to purchase and how easy they are to trade.\n\nAnalysis of the trade in IHC’s stock shows it has often been bought and sold in large batches of multiple trades of a similar number of shares at the same time. Analysts say such trades appear pre-arranged and that it can be challenging for investors to buy IHC’s stock.\n\nBig batches of the same volumes of shares traded simultaneously make up the bulk of IHC trades. From January 5 2020 to January 27 2023, this type of transaction made up two-thirds of IHC trades, according to an FT analysis of ADX data. By comparison, this pattern was observed for only 8 per cent of trades in Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and 3 per cent of Etisalat, two other big ADX-listed stocks.\n\nOwnership in IHC and Alpha Dhabi is highly concentrated and the proportion of shares readily available to trade is limited. IHC, which is 62 per cent owned by Royal Group, an entity controlled by Sheikh Tahnoon, has a free float of about 24 per cent, the company told the FT late last year. Its 2021 annual report said 18 shareholders owned 96.7 per cent of its stock. Alpha Dhabi’s report from the same year said 19 shareholders controlled more than 98 per cent of its stock.\n\nForeign investors — who have recently tended to be either US citizens or Emirati expatriates — make up a tiny share: 6 per cent in IHC and 3 per cent in Alpha Dhabi, according to ADX data.\n\nThere is no suggestion of illegal activity by IHC, which pledged $400mn to Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s abortive share sale last week, or its subsidiaries but their expansion and activities have left bankers and analysts scratching their heads.\n\n“If you want to get exposure to them you can’t because you can’t access their shares — it’s ridiculous,” said the market analyst. “It raises the question: why is all this happening? In a way, it’s no one’s business, but it does cast a shadow on the market. It changes the character in some ways but in others it doesn’t at all, because this activity is for friends and families, it seems. It’s not for the world at large to participate.”\n\nIHC said its shares “are available to the market at a price for anyone” who wishes to invest, adding that it was “open, true and direct with information about our organisation, while adhering to market regulators’ governance and compliance standards”.\n\nADX said it “operates to the highest principles of corporate governance and transparency”, adding that listed companies “must adhere to comprehensive disclosure guidelines that are in line with global standards”.\n\nThe state’s influence is never far away. Among the 13 companies that have listed on the ADX since 2020 is Abu Dhabi Ports, which is majority owned by ADQ, a sovereign investment vehicle that also controls ADX and is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon.\n\nOther recent IPOs of business that foreign investors do understand, include Borouge,  a joint venture between state oil company Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Borealis, and satellite communications company Yahsat, which is controlled by Mubadala, another state investment fund\n\nBut IHC and its subsidiaries have produced the most spectacular growth, through big transfers of assets from related companies, with IHC’s assets swelling from $215mn in 2018 to $54bn as of September 2022.\n\nAlpha Dhabi’s assets jumped from $1.5bn in 2020 to nearly $13bn in 2021, the year of its listing, as it reported a surge in profits from $59mn to $1.4bn and a fourfold rise in revenue to $5bn. Its number of subsidiaries went from 16 to more than 100.\n\nIHC says asset transfers from Royal Group, many for a nominal charge of one dirham, have been a key driver of its growth.\n\nAlpha Dhabi — formerly known as Trojan — was previously wholly owned by Royal Group. In April 2021 a 45 per cent stake was transferred for “nil consideration” to IHC, which today owns 86 per cent of the company. More than 40 companies have been transferred from Royal Group, the majority at a nominal value of one dirham each.\n\nMultiply, a communications company previously wholly owned by Royal Group, was also transferred to IHC for nil consideration on April 1 2020.\n\nIt now holds a driving school, wellness firms, beauty salons and a 7.3 per cent stake in Taqa, a utility company controlled by ADQ and the second largest stock on the ADX.\n\nAssets rose from $26.6mn in 2020 to more than $3bn the following year, it said. Multiply acquired at least three companies in 2021 for nil consideration: Pal Cooling, Emirates Driving School and cosmetics group Bedashing.\n\nMultiply, which listed in December 2021 and boasts a $13bn market capitalisation, is among the 10 largest stocks in the MSCI UAE index.\n\nAlong the way International Securities, an Abu Dhabi brokerage firm acquired by IHC in November 2019, also experienced spectacular growth — soaring to the top ranks of brokers serving the ADX.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020 it handled 8 per cent of the value of trades and 9.8 per cent of the volumes. It now handles 64.2 per cent by value and 45.3 per cent by volume, according to ADX data. Analysts say the data suggests it buys and sells shares on the ADX in large batches — a pattern that fits with the trades in IHC shares.\n\nThe broker’s assets grew from $186mn in 2019 to $1.2bn in 2021, while revenues soared 216 per cent, according to IHC’s 2021 annual report.\n\nIHC said International Securities “had fast, yet organic growth considering the number of IPOs [16] they have facilitated since 2020”, adding that the brokerage had attracted 25,000 “active clients”.\n\nSteffen Hertog, a Gulf expert at the London School of Economics, said the web of companies was a reflection of “the continued deeper presence of the Al Nahyan family in the Abu Dhabi economy” compared to the ruling Al Maktoum family in Dubai.\n\n“Which is not to say that the distinction between government and family business is crystal clear in the latter,” he added. “But there are fewer ruling family players and there is relatively more space for large non-royal private groups.”\n\nData visualisation by Chris Campbell and Patrick Mathurin",

    "body": "In November, the world’s tallest tower, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, was lit up with the colours and logo of Standard Chartered.\n\nAs the bank’s chief executive Bill Winters and chair José Viñals looked on, messages such as “together we’re here for good” and “aligned ambitions” sparked into life.\n\nWhile in Dubai, the two directors held a full board meeting and met senior figures in the region. But two months later they were blindsided when news broke that First Abu Dhabi Bank, the United Arab Emirates’ biggest lender, wanted to buy StanChart.\n\n“It was a complete surprise to the board,” said one person familiar with the matter.\n\nHowever, it was no secret that the oil-rich Emirates was in an acquisitive mood.\n\nFirst Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) was born in 2017 when the UAE merged its first- and third-largest lenders to create a national champion. But the scale of its international ambitions was only revealed alongside news it had been working for almost a year to buy StanChart and create a lender with more than $1tn in assets operating in more than 60 markets — a first for the Middle East.\n\n“The region is saying ‘here we are’. The centre of the world has moved,” said one senior figure who advises FAB. “They see themselves as a major centre of activity and not just oil economies.”\n\n“The banking sector is absolutely ripe for the next step up,” said Gary Dugan, chief investment officer at Dubai-based Dalma Capital and a former executive of FAB’s predecessor, the National Bank of Abu Dhabi.\n\nAfter the news leaked, FAB quickly said it was no longer evaluating an offer, kicking off a six-month period where they are restricted from acting again, unless another bidder emerges.\n\nBut several people close to the lender say the deal could be revived after the cooling off period ends in July. FAB and StanChart declined to comment.\n\n“The region certainly has the firepower to make a statement in this regard. We deserve to be taken more seriously,” said a government minister from another country in the Gulf.\n\nCompanies and funds in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have more than $3tn in assets and cash under management, boosted by a boom in energy prices amid the war in Ukraine. Saudi Arabia’s $620bn Public Investment Fund has bought companies from electric vehicle start-up Lucid to Newcastle United football club as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman looks to diversify the economy away from oil.\n\nBut cross-border banking takeovers are very rare because of the cost, complexity and risk involved. Previously, Middle Eastern investors have preferred to take stakes in troubled foreign lenders.\n\nQatari funds led an £11.8bn emergency fundraising for Barclays in 2008 and Middle Eastern investors now own a fifth of Credit Suisse.\n\nDemonstrating the scale of capital that can be brought to bear, the Saudi National Bank’s chair dismissed its recent $1.5bn investment in Credit Suisse as “just another cheque”, barely more than 2 per cent of its $68.7bn investment portfolio.\n\n“It’s a 166-year-old brand, so how far below 30 cents on the dollar is it going to go?” he added.\n\nStanChart, 169 years old, trades barely higher at 42 pence on the pound.\n\nFAB is also deep-pocketed and intrinsically linked to the state. Its chair is the UAE’s national security adviser and businessman Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, whose brother is the president and ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan.\n\nAbu Dhabi’s $284bn sovereign investment fund Mubadala owns 38 per cent of FAB and was a driving force behind the attempt for StanChart, according to people familiar with the process. Mubadala said it would not comment on marketplace rumours about publicly listed institutions.\n\nFAB’s stock has surged 72 per cent since the pandemic struck in March 2020, giving it a market value of $43bn, almost double that of StanChart at $25bn.\n\nWhile dominant domestically, FAB’s international network is modest. More than three-quarters of its revenue is made in the UAE and to grow it must diversify.\n\nIn 2021, FAB bought the Egyptian operations of Lebanese bank Audi. Then last February, it grew bolder, making an offer for Egypt-based regional broker and adviser EFG-Hermes to bolster its weak investment banking arm.\n\nAdvisers say the bid was withdrawn a couple of months later amid Egyptian resistance. But disappointment was brushed aside as FAB turned its attention towards StanChart, several people involved in the process told the Financial Times.\n\nEarly last year chief executive Hana Al Rostamani hired New York boutique investment bank Moelis & Co to help identify and analyse transformational targets, said the people. StanChart was top of the list.\n\nIts founder Ken Moelis — once dubbed “Ken of Arabia” for his connections in the region — helped pitch and explain the rationale to the government officials and technocrats who would have to sanction any offer.\n\nStanChart offered an immediate expansion outside its saturated home market into Africa, India, south-east Asia and China, as well as exposure to Europe and the US. With FAB trading at two times book value to StanChart’s 0.4 times, it was also seen as affordable, the people added.\n\nPerformance at StanChart has lagged behind peers. Winters, who took over in 2015, had overseen an operating income decline while competitors in key markets, such as DBS in Singapore, had grown. Despite announcing several cost-cutting programmes, expenses remain roughly the same as in 2015.\n\nVarious other targets were discussed, such as Barclays and BNP Paribas, the people added. Acquiring a series of smaller lenders was considered, but that was discarded because it would have been “a long arduous process with no certainty of success and huge integration challenges”, another person involved said.\n\nIn the early summer, the board gave the green light to an all-cash bid of £30bn to £32bn aimed at minimising opposition from StanChart.\n\nFAB’s deal team was pushing but some government entities demanded further due diligence on the transaction in the early autumn, one adviser said. FAB would have had to rely on financing from funds such as state-owned ADQ, which is also chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon, and crucially Mubadala, the adviser added. ADQ and Mubadala declined to comment.\n\nBacking could also come from $240bn Abu Dhabi-listed conglomerate International Holding Company — another business that Tahnoon chairs, one of the people said. IHC said it would not “comment on market rumours or speculation”.\n\nCitigroup, Bain, Deloitte and Linklaters were brought in to enhance operational capacity and conduct studies around synergies, audit and legal issues.\n\nNeither FAB nor its advisers approached any shareholders or the board, or StanChart’s corporate brokers JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn the end, it did not matter. Due diligence on the deal had not been completed before the news leaked — something the phalanx of advisers had made inevitable. “Too many cooks spoiled the unready broth,” one of the advisers added.\n\nFAB is considering several options when the cooling off period ends, two of the people involved told the FT.\n\nIt could choose to approach existing large StanChart shareholders and ask them to retain substantial stakes in the expanded group, making the $30bn to $40bn cost easier to digest.\n\nOne top-10 shareholder told the FT that a cash offer of a third above the trading price would mean “an argument” internally about whether to take it.\n\n“We think the bank is trading at a massive discount,” the person said. “It would be tempting to take it, but we would feel we would be giving away a lot of value.”\n\nBy far the most important shareholder would be Singapore’s state-owned investment fund Temasek, which owns 16.4 per cent of the stock. A cash offer would allow the fund to exit after having built its stake at a higher valuation, but any deal would also face political ramifications given the expected exodus of thousands of StanChart roles from Singapore to the UAE’s capital.\n\nTemasek said it did not comment on market speculation but people briefed on the fund’s thinking said it could consider selling part or all of its stake if another, higher, bid came in. They added that it would be a purely commercial decision.\n\nFAB could also try for a friendly transaction; however, there is a risk that this would lead to a bidding war because the board would be duty-bound to seek rival offers.\n\nThe main hurdle to any transaction remains the need to gain approval from scores of regulators. The trickiest might be the US, which would have to allow the fifth-largest dollar-clearing bank to be regulated by the central bank of the UAE, itself under enhanced scrutiny by the world’s anti-money laundering watchdog.\n\nAnother question is whether FAB’s executive team would be deemed experienced enough to lead a global systemically important financial institution, leading to the prospect of the existing StanChart management being asked to remain in place, said a senior figure at StanChart.\n\nWinters and Viñals both said at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos that they had not spoken to FAB since the news broke.\n\n“This is not something we’ve either engaged with, or been interested in,” Winters said.\n\nThe top 10 shareholder suggested Winters still wanted to turn the bank round himself, something that has become easier to accomplish as rates rise and China’s zero-Covid policy ends.\n\n“Winters doesn’t want his reputation to be tarnished,” the person said.\n\nAfraid of being taken unawares again, StanChart executives are scouring the UAE for intelligence on Abu Dhabi’s intentions. But they also realise that FAB’s approach could flush out other suitors.\n\n“Now the interest is public, it has opened Pandora’s box,” said a senior Middle Eastern banker at a rival. “If it isn’t FAB, it will be someone else.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Mercedes Ruehl",

    "body": "Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Gunvor, the energy trading house, are extending an exclusivity period for deal talks as they try to reach an agreement over a possible investment.\n\nPeople close to the deal say discussions could lead to Adnoc taking a minority stake in Gunvor, whose net profits soared to $841mn in the first half of last year — higher than its full-year profits in 2021 — as energy markets were roiled by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe exclusivity period for the talks, which began last summer, had been due to expire at the end of December, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAdnoc, which is the United Arab Emirates’ state oil producer and pumps roughly 4 per cent of all global crude supplies, is working to diversify its revenue streams and build out its trading division.\n\nGunvor — co-founded in 2000 by chief executive Torbjörn Törnqvist and Russian oligarch Gennady Timchenko — is looking to raise funds to drive growth.\n\nAdnoc’s trading arm is preparing to open its first Swiss office this year, as part of plans to expand the unit.\n\nChief executive Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, who will also serve as president of this year’s UN climate summit when the UAE hosts the meeting in November and December, previously said he wanted to “stretch the value” of every barrel of Adnoc oil through investments in refining and trading capacity.\n\nBut the talks have faltered at times, with the two companies having contrasting backgrounds: Adnoc is a state-owned energy behemoth that founded its trading division less than five years ago, while Gunvor is known for its aggressive culture and its once-close ties to Russia.\n\nGunvor is one of a handful of large-scale independent commodity traders, including Trafigura, Vitol and Mercuria, that play a significant role in global energy trading, acting as middlemen and operators of infrastructure such as terminals and refineries.\n\nThe past year has seen unprecedented profits for trading houses because of the volatility in oil and gas markets triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTörnqvist, who controls almost 90 per cent of Gunvor, has been considering a sale for some time. He held unsuccessful talks in 2019 with Algeria’s state-backed energy company Sonatrach and has discussed potential tie-ups with other trading houses in the past, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nWhile Gunvor’s roots lie in Russian oil dealing, it has branched out in recent years to become one of the world’s largest traders of liquefied natural gas.\n\nIn 2014, shortly before Gunvor co-founder Timchenko was sanctioned by the US government for his alleged ties to President Vladimir Putin, the Russian trader sold his stake to Törnqvist, and has since left the company. The US state department alleged at the time that Putin himself may “have access to Gunvor funds” without providing evidence.\n\nGunvor has always fiercely denied allegations that it has links to Putin and has spent the nine years since Timchenko’s exit diversifying its business away from the Russian sector, such as selling most of its stake in the Ust Luga oil terminal, close to the border with Estonia.\n\nThe commodity trader, despite its record half-year profits in 2022, has also faced financial pressures due to the high margin calls placed on trading houses owing to the extreme volatility in energy markets last year.\n\nAdnoc and Gunvor declined to comment.",

    "blurb": "Minister admits last year’s political chaos potentially slowed pace of inward commitments from the Gulf state ",
    "date": "2023-01-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UK expects to raise tens of billions of pounds of investment from the United Arab Emirates as it resets its business relationship after last year’s political chaos in Westminster.\n\nGrant Shapps, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, said on Friday that “political changes” in the UK, which resulted in the country having three prime ministers in a year, had potentially slowed the pace of inward investment from the Gulf state.\n\nHe added that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February and resulting policy changes, such as windfall taxes on energy companies had also been factors.\n\nDuring meetings with government official and sovereign funds, Shapps said that UAE investors were focused on going beyond the £6.1bn of investment already made through the five-year £10bn UAE-UK partnership, which was sealed in 2021.\n\n“They [UAE investors] are absolutely certain that they would go to £10bn and beyond,” he said, while the remaining £4bn of inward commitments would be “met and smashed through”.\n\n“There are tens of billions of pounds more of investment which we know is there,” Shapps said. “Things went on hold a bit over the summer and into the autumn but they [UAE investors] were pleased to hear it’s settled down.”\n\n“Rishi Sunak runs a government which is organised, factual and based on data . . . They are very pleased to hear about that,” he added.\n\nUAE investment under the partnership has spanned life sciences, clean energy, technology and infrastructure, including Abu Dhabi sovereign investment firm Mubadala’s £800mn investment into CityFibre, a UK telecoms company laying broadband lines in the UK.\n\nGulf sovereign funds have privately expressed frustration at the drift in UK decision-making during the end of former prime minister Boris Johnson’s administration and Liz Truss’s brief period in office that followed.\n\nThe UAE has been particularly interested in investing in sectors such as clean energy, including battery storage and wind power, as well as nuclear energy and life sciences, said Shapps. He noted the UK was also looking to reciprocate with more investments into the UAE.\n\nDuring the trip, Shapps, who came to Abu Dhabi from Riyadh, met with senior business figures including Khaldoon al-Mubarak, chief executive of Mubadala. “We are ready to get back on track,” said a spokesperson from the state investment firm.\n\nThe UAE and other Gulf states, buoyed by high international oil prices, are scouring the globe for investment opportunities, as well as ramping up domestic development plans. Financiers have been making a beeline to the region in recent months to tap, what many regard, as one of the last remaining pools of excess liquidity in the world.\n\nThe UK’s investment minister, Lord Dominic Johnson, has taken over the role of “point man” for Gulf sovereign funds looking to invest in Britain since the departure of his predecessor Lord Gerry Grimstone last July.\n\nThe UAE is also interested in the UK’s efforts to develop new nuclear power stations through the Great British Nuclear vehicle, including the government’s £700mn investment in the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk.\n\nThe UK will eventually seek £20bn from other investors for Sizewell C, said Shapps, as well as funding for small modular reactor technology.",

    "blurb": "In 2019, International Holding Company was a little-known company involved in fish farms, food and real estate",
    "date": "2023-01-0800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Three years ago, International Holding Company was a little known company that ran fish farms and food and real estate businesses. It employed just 40 people. Today, the Abu Dhabi-listed group’s market capitalisation of $240bn is more than double that of global giants Siemens and GE and it has a headcount of 150,000.\n\nIt is an extraordinary transformation that has largely gone unnoticed outside the United Arab Emirates, and is little understood — even by bankers based in the region.\n\n“Nobody knows,” said one Gulf-based international banker when asked to explain IHC’s dramatic growth. It is a common response to questions about the conglomerate, despite it accounting for a third of the FADX 15, the benchmark index of the ADX Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. As its share price has soared 42,000 per cent since 2019, it has become the second largest listed company in the Middle East after Saudi Aramco, the state oil company.\n\nEven Syed Basar Shueb, who took over as IHC’s chief executive in mid-2019, acknowledged that “it’s amazing”.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, he insisted there are simple explanations for the company’s growth — the transfer of more than 40 companies, which combined are worth $4.7bn according to IHC, from Royal Group, another Abu Dhabi conglomerate. The majority of the businesses were transferred at nominal value of one dirham each, Shueb said.\n\nYet that explains only part of the story: IHC’s total assets have swelled from $215mn at the end of 2018 to $54bn in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nAccording to IHC, this is down to the growth of the businesses it now controls. “We don’t give any dividend, the profits we made in 2020, 2021 is mainly . . . invested back,” Shueb said. “We are trying to create a giant here . . . a global giant.”\n\nOthers, however, view IHC as an example of the increasingly blurred relationship between business and power in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital and wealthiest member of the federation. It has also sparked questions about transparency.\n\n“It’s probably the biggest threat to the ADX because we don’t know what’s happening,” said the banker. “There’s a lot of great things happening on the ADX, and then there’s this thing that nobody knows.”\n\nSuch is the concern about the spectacular growth of IHC’s market capitalisation that officials in neighbouring Dubai no longer consider the possibility of reviving discussions on a future merger of its stock market with the ADX, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nErnst & Young said its review of IHC’s latest financial statement, for the third quarter of last year, was “substantially less in scope” than an audit along international standards and therefore E&Y was unable to obtain assurance “of all significant matters”.\n\nIHC said: “Due to the limited amount of information that is required to be presented in an interim financial statement . . . external auditors typically do not conduct a full-fledged audit of these financial statements.”\n\nThe company’s transformation can be timed to the period Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, one of the most powerful figures in Abu Dhabi, took over as chair in 2020. As well as being the UAE’s national security adviser, he is the full brother of its president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, and he oversees an expanding business empire.\n\nIn addition to his role at IHC, he chairs ADQ, a new and increasingly active state investment vehicle, First Abu Dhabi Bank, the UAE’s largest lender, and Group42, an Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and cloud computing company.\n\nHe also controls Royal Group, a holding company that owns 62 per cent of IHC. About 24 per cent of IHC’s shares are freely floated, with more than 90 per cent of investors from the Gulf.\n\nShueb said Sheikh Tahnoon’s vision for IHC “was limited to creating value for the shareholders”.\n\n“How we create [value] is cascaded to the management,” he said.\n\nHe dismissed scepticism about what had driven the rapid share price growth, saying it was a “little bit of ignorance of the bankers who are not looking at it properly”.\n\n“The investor who is willing to invest at this market cap, it is only because they have done their homework well because they can see those assets have a significant value,” he said. “I believe people are anticipating that those certain assets that are still outside [with Royal Group] will come to the IHC group . . . which I’m not denying, it’s likely they will come.”\n\nShueb sought to explain the group’s goal as “one simple thing — [to] create value for our shareholders by investing in different portfolios, not one stream of investment”.\n\n“We do the acquisition, we do the synergy, immediately next we go for diversification,” he said.\n\nAs an example, he said if IHC bought a telecoms company it would integrate it on the services side of IHC, and expand into “solutions” and “hardware sales”. In agriculture, the plan was to supply food from “farm to table”.\n\nHe added that the company has a $10bn war chest for investments and is targeting group revenue growth from $7.7bn in 2021 to $27bn in 2023, largely through acquisitions.\n\n“Our five-year plan is to reach 1tn dirham [$272bn] in revenue at least, in acquisitions, and our own businesses are doing very well,” Shueb said.\n\nDeals by IHC in 2022 include investing $2bn in three Mumbai-listed companies that are part of the empire of Gautam Adani, Asia’s richest man, $500mn to buy a 50 per cent stake in a Turkish clean energy company, and a $2bn offer to buy up to 31.25 per cent of Colombian food group Grupo Nutresa.\n\nShueb attributed IHC profits of $6.5bn in the first nine months of 2022, a 236 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2021, largely to investments, including its stake in the Adani companies.\n\nShueb said IHC’s focus was on tech, healthcare, real estate, construction, food and agribusiness and general investment. Geographically, its attention was on Asia and Latin America and it is looking for deals in markets as diverse as Turkey and Indonesia.\n\n“These are progressing economies; they have population; they have reasonable systems to support all this growth and at the end of the day, because we are from Abu Dhabi and UAE population is only 10mn, I cannot . . . reach 100mn population but I can reach 100mn through these companies,” he said.\n\nHe added that IHC was also “looking at certain deals” in the US, where it already has some holdings, including a stake in Elon Musk’s SpaceX. However, he viewed Europe as “a very uncertain market right now”.\n\n“We are getting a lot of very good deals [in Europe], but [we] don’t know if these good deals will stay good,” he added.\n\nAsked why there was no independent research on the group despite its size and dominance of the ADX, Shueb said “it’s up to them if they want to do it or not”.\n\n“When I go to the market for any IPO for my companies, I get enough questions from the local investor base . . . they have enough research on our financials,” he said. “Our books are very open.”\n\nIHC has had discussions with a credit agency about a rating, but that process hit a stumbling block when the agency asked what to compare the group with, Shueb said.\n\n“The team are still working [on the rating and] most likely will find a solution,” he added.\n\nHe said IHC had debt of about 10bn dirham, excluding operating debt at portfolio companies, and would look to increase its borrowing as it expanded. The group had begun developing relations with international banks, he added, including securing a loan of “several billion dollars” from Standard Chartered and was engaging with Goldman Sachs and UBS.\n\nOthers still need convincing of the group’s strategy.\n\n“I don’t understand it because it’s a $200bn market cap company that files less disclosure than entities significantly smaller than that, and the whole complex of listed and unlisted subsidies that are highly active,” said another Gulf-based banker.\n\nHowever, “it’s such an important source of deal flow that I’m sure some banks are examining what they can do,” to get involved, he added.",

    "date": "2023-01-0400:00:00.0",
    "body": "The football World Cup in Qatar was not the only show drawing attention to the oil-rich Gulf in recent weeks. In Abu Dhabi, an annual finance conference was so packed that attendees were left with standing room only as the region is increasingly viewed as one of the remaining sources of abundant capital.\n\nWhen sessions ended, bankers and investors squeezed through corridors pitching deals on the hoof. “It was so busy, it felt like the whole island sank a little,” one Abu Dhabi official quipped to a banker present.\n\nThere were similar scenes in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, where the kingdom’s so-called “Davos in the Desert” investor conference drew record numbers with more than 1,000 “global executives” attending, including about 400 from the US and scores from Europe.\n\nFor many of those beating a path to the Gulf there is one thing on their minds — luring capital from, and striking deals with, sovereign wealth funds as the region enjoys its first petrodollar-fuelled boom in a decade.\n\n“You have the world and his wife coming here looking for capital,” says a veteran Gulf-based banker. “It feels like 2008.”\n\nThat was the year that thrust many of the Gulf’s SWFs into the spotlight as oil prices soared to a record $147 a barrel, while much of the rest of the world suffered the global financial crisis.\n\nBack then it was Abu Dhabi’s stable of investment vehicles and the Kuwaiti and Qatari SWFs that made the biggest splashes. These funds became go-to investors for distressed western assets desperate to raise capital. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Barclays and Daimler were among high-profile companies and brands bolstered by injections of Gulf petrodollars.\n\nToday, the SWFs are once again eyeing opportunities amid another bout of global tumult, buoyed by petrodollar surpluses after oil prices last year reached their highest levels since 2008.\n\nWhile much of the world braces for recession, the IMF forecasts that the Middle East’s oil and gas producers are set to reap up to $1.3tn in additional revenues than had been expected over the next four years as energy prices were pushed up by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Much of it will flow to the Gulf, home to top crude exporter Saudi Arabia and the largest liquefied natural gas exporter Qatar.\n\nIt is a boom that is set to bolster the soft power of the region’s increasingly confident absolute monarchies, notably Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as he seeks to defuse criticism of his regime’s human rights record and project the kingdom as a major G20 power.\n\n“The quantum available is massive,” says an investment banker. “For the last two months, every week we have one or two companies here, primarily from the US, but also Europe, China, India, doing roadshows.”\n\nYet Gulf officials caution there are differences with 2008. Although they consider this as a moment to capitalise on, this time they say the investments will be done in a more strategic and less opportunistic manner.\n\n“It’s not about the deal flow that is seeking us out. We want the deal flow that fits with our strategic ambitions,” says Khaldoon Mubarak, chief executive of Mubadala, a $284bn Abu Dhabi sovereign fund that has investments in more than 50 countries. “In 2008 we reacted well, but this time our approach is more proactive and strategically deliberate.”\n\nThe Middle East’s sovereign wealth funds are bigger and more experienced than in 2008.\n\nMubadala managed assets of just $15bn during that period. Abu Dhabi, the wealthy capital of the United Arab Emirates, has also consolidated funds over the past decade after two of its vehicles — Aabar and Ipic — got sucked into Malaysia’s 1MDB fraud, which became one of the world’s biggest financial scandals. The $450bn Qatar Investment Authority was just three years old in 2008 and often appeared to act on impulse rather than strategy.\n\n“We were very young [in 2008] — the teams were a bit smaller and we were building the portfolio from scratch, so we were more opportunistic,” says Mansoor bin Ebrahim al-Mahmoud, QIA chief executive. “Nowadays, it’s totally different. We are mature, well established, with specialised teams and a robust asset-allocation strategy.”\n\nHe is eyeing an “opportunity to reposition our portfolio in certain directions, to fill certain gaps or correct overexposure”.\n\nYet one of the main draws for investors this time round is a fund that sat on the sidelines during the 2008 boom — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, or PIF. It has undergone a radical reinvention since Prince Mohammed took over as chair in 2015 as it has been tasked with leading Riyadh’s grandiose plans to overhaul its rentier economy.\n\nIt has committed to spending hundreds of billions of dollars at home, while using its newfound financial and political clout to diversify the kingdom’s overseas exposure. It is also pursuing strategic investments to lure technology and knowhow onshore to bolster Riyadh’s development plans.\n\n“It’s massive asset management, a sovereign wealth fund, a conglomerate and a government policy extension all combined into one,” says another senior investment banker, with a “tremendous appetite” for opportunities.\n\nRizwan Shaikh, co-head of emerging markets at Citigroup’s banking, capital markets and advisory division in Emea, says: “We have to be selective in terms of who we bring in to put in front of the funds, but they are keen and want to see what’s out there.”\n\nAt the same time, he says the main inquiries his bank is receiving are from clients looking for capital and strategic partners. “It’s kind of the first thing people think about — we need strategic capital, where are the sources?”\n\nThe new phase of dealmaking by the Gulf’s SWFs began with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMubadala invested a record $30bn in 2021. Last year, it committed to investing £10bn in the UK over five years, and has already deployed about half of it. Its younger sister, ADQ, has been on the acquisition trail across the Middle East, north Africa and Turkey. Even Adia, Abu Dhabi’s most traditional and conservative SWF, has been investing at a high velocity.\n\nSome, however, believe there is still time for asset prices to fall further, meaning they are not in a rush.\n\n“Is it a market where you have a lot of cheap assets and it’s time to attack? No, I think there’s a lot more pain that’s still coming,” says Mubarak, chief executive of Mubadala. “We’re careful how we deploy our powder. We’re well positioned in terms of liquidity and in terms of access to deal flow.”\n\nElsewhere, the QIA’s largest investments last year include €2.4bn in German power company RWE and $1.5bn in Bodhi, James Murdoch’s media venture in India. It was an anchor investor in Porsche’s initial public offering.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the PIF has done fewer of the sort of big-ticket deals it did in 2016 when it took a $3.5bn stake in Uber and pumped $45bn into SoftBank’s floundering Vision Fund. But it continues to be highly active, launching myriad companies at home, from a Saudi electric vehicle brand, Ceer, to coffee and aircraft leasing companies, while also trading billions of dollars in overseas stocks.\n\nThe fund’s foreign exposure has surged from 9 per cent of its assets in 2017 to about a quarter in June, while the size of the fund has swelled from about $150bn seven years ago to more than $600bn. Its target is to reach more than $1tn assets under management by 2025, with about 30 per cent in international investments.\n\nNoticeable global deals this year include its decision to pump more than $3bn into gaming companies, including taking a 5 per cent stake in Nintendo.\n\nThe PIF’s transformation underscores the dramatic shift in the kingdom’s risk appetite and the way the leadership intends to manage its wealth. In the past, Saudi governments typically used boom periods to dispense largesse to the population through benefits, subsidies and public sector wage increases, while also embarking on a flurry of state spending on infrastructure projects.\n\nThat would propel growth in the state-dominated economy, but lead to cycles of boom and bust, with the latter characterised by yawning deficits, stalled projects and delayed payments to contractors. Any money that was saved would be tucked away at the central bank and conservatively managed.\n\nToday, much of the state spending is channelled through the PIF and a National Development Fund, which are expected to be the main beneficiaries of the recent surpluses. “We don’t want money sitting idle yielding zero,” says finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan, who also is a member of the PIF board.\n\nThe delicate balance Riyadh wants to strike, he says, is maintaining fiscal discipline while also taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the boom.\n\nHe insists that Riyadh has strengthened its institutional capacity to monitor the efficiency and control of state spending, saying it is using a data-driven approach to prioritise projects based on potential economic return. As an example, he cites the establishment of a “spending efficiency centre”, with more than 500 staff, to help avoid “a rush in spending without proper plans”. It has generated direct and indirect savings of $186bn since 2016, according to the ministry.\n\nThe goal, Jadaan says, is “how to avoid projects from going bust when we have seen hundreds and hundreds of projects [in the past] start strong and then in the middle for whatever reason . . . are not completed”.\n\nHe adds that the difference today “is you are investing when there’s capacity in productive assets, in assets and expenditure that will create more jobs and grow the economy”.\n\nRiyadh has already used the windfall to accelerate projects, Jadaan adds, citing logistics as the kingdom plans to develop a railway network connecting the east and west, and Red Sea ports.\n\n“We are taking advantage of this moment as we speak,” he says. “We are going to spend more when we have more money, and we may even borrow more.”\n\nThe PIF raised $17bn in November through a syndicated loan, weeks after it raised $3bn through a green bond, a nod to the fact that even with the kingdom’s oil wealth, the fund will need to borrow to meet its large commitments.\n\nSteffen Hertog, a Gulf expert at the London School of Economics, says that while the finance ministry has put in more controls on spending, it is the PIF’s activities that raise concerns, adding that “we get almost no disclosure on the spending they undertake”.\n\nThat the PIF, and some of the projects it oversees, are using debt also creates potential sovereign risk, he adds. Even with the windfall, questions linger about how the PIF will meet its financial commitments. Experts say just Neom, the futuristic city that is Prince Mohammed’s flagship megaproject, will cost far more than $500bn originally stated.\n\n“In a way it’s actually potentially even less accountable and less transparent than the previous sort of spending booms,” Hertog says. “It’s more speculative than the capital spending that you would have had under governments. It can create higher returns but is also riskier; some people are worried about that.”\n\nA key focus among officials in Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the current boom is to utilise state funds to bring companies to their shores to support domestic development plans. It comes as economic competition heats up in the region.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, officials talk of using the funds to help accelerate the development of tech and renewable energy hubs, as well as the emirate’s financial centre, ADGM. As part of the latter strategy, Abu Dhabi is promising to commit seed capital to private equity funds willing to set up in the ADGM.\n\n“The private equity market is changing. Today there’s an opportunity because most people are scaling back and we have the ability to scale up,” says Mubarak, of Mubadala.\n\nYet in terms of scale and ambition, nothing compares to what the PIF is attempting to achieve in the Gulf’s largest economy and most populous nation.\n\nAs it has become the dominant economic force in Saudi Arabia, it has created more than 60 new domestic companies over the past seven years. It expects to invest $40bn annually in the economy over the next decade, with its mandate covering everything from developing a new airport and airline, to incubating and growing new industries and driving vast infrastructure projects.\n\n“It’s almost nationalisation in reverse,” says a senior investment banker. “Everything else is going to get crowded out.”\n\nThe PIF’s domestic strategy includes an emphasis on sectors where Riyadh believes it can expand industries utilising domestic resources, such as mining and building materials, as well as projects designed to reverse the tradition of Saudis going abroad for shopping, tourism and entertainment, and support the nation’s development, including housing, healthcare and financial services.\n\nBut other areas where there is high local demand, but limited supply, such as automotives or defence, will require the PIF importing capacity through acquisitions.\n\nTo support this, the fund’s MENA and international investment teams can co-ordinate on investing in foreign stocks that fit with the domestic programme. The clearest example is the PIF’s 62 per cent stake in Lucid, which led to the electric vehicle maker establishing a manufacturing hub in the kingdom.\n\nHertog says Saudi Arabia in particular is likely to need to acquire majority stakes to lure that foreign direct investment it is seeking, saying “companies could promise them all sorts of things to get capital injections”.\n\n“But you’ll have a real principal agency problem — where the company wants capital, but it doesn’t want to invest in Saudi,” he says. “You will be back to that logic of kind of offset deals in defence, where companies have to sort of go through the motions and invest locally without really wanting to do it.”\n\nPrevious efforts by Gulf states to bring industry to their shores, be it Saudi Arabia’s past ambitions to develop auto manufacturing, or Abu Dhabi’s plans to establish a semiconductor plant in the emirate after Mubadala pumped billions of dollars into semiconductor firm GlobalFoundries, never made it off the drawing board. And Saudi Arabia’s history is littered with projects that have either stalled or failed.\n\nStill, the veteran Gulf-based banker says while it is inevitable that resources will be wasted, “what’s more striking is each country has entities that seem better able to manage the money”.\n\nThe risks, he says, “are we go backwards in terms of greed and corruption because there’s so much money around”.\n\nFor now, though, the mood in the Gulf is one of confidence.\n\n“We will make mistakes, but overall I think we are doing a great job,” says Jadaan. “We are very confident, [but] cautious, obviously the world is in turbulence and we are not isolated.”\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nGulf state ‘gold rush’ is no more than fleeting mirage/From Zaid M Belbagi, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",

    "body": "Dubai rang in the new year by suspending a 30 per cent tax on alcohol sales as the emirate seeks to consolidate its position as the Gulf’s tourism and business hotspot.\n\nThe initiative, which took effect on Sunday, will last for a year and has been described as a trial period by industry executives informed of the decision.\n\nDubai, the region’s commercial and tourist centre where expatriates outnumber nationals by nine to one, has been liberalising regulations in recent years to make itself more attractive for foreign workers.\n\nThe city faces tough competition from richer neighbours that are seeking to wean themselves off hydrocarbon dependency by developing service sectors — such as hospitality and finance — that have long been the mainstay of oil-poor Dubai’s economy.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has been enticing many expatriates with bumper salaries, is developing new industries and opening up to entertainment. Once closed to tourists except pilgrims, the kingdom is promoting its historical sites and considering legalising the sale of alcohol. Qatar, having showcased itself during the Fifa World Cup, is also developing hospitality.\n\n“The cut should further support the tourism and hospitality sectors, after the strong recovery from the pandemic,” said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. “The move should also be welcomed by many residents, who are predominantly expatriates.”\n\nMMI, one of two Dubai firms that distribute alcohol, said it would scrap the fee for the personal licence required to purchase alcohol and reflect the tax removal across its products.\n\nAt one store in Dubai, staff were informed of the decision on the afternoon of New Year’s Eve. They worked overnight through the city’s multiple fireworks celebrations to relabel the stock. “I’ve never seen prices as low as this,” said one experienced staff member.\n\nDubai, the Gulf’s party capital, has for decades managed to attract more tourists and wealthy expatriate workers than its regional rivals thanks to the homegrown Muslim population’s tolerance of the city’s more liberal lifestyle.\n\nBut tourists regularly complain about the prohibitive cost of licensed restaurants, which tend to mark up alcohol prices four to five times. “It will be interesting to see whether this tax break is fully passed on to the consumer,” said one industry executive.\n\nThe city has swung back strongly from the pandemic, luring new residents by curbing coronavirus while also keeping the economy relatively open.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has also seen Dubai emerge as a financial haven for Russians. The easing of Covid-19 restrictions in China is another potential new stream of property buyers as house valuations and rents skyrocket.\n\nAs travel returns to normal, the state-owned carrier and airports are reporting strong demand. The World Cup in Qatar supercharged the hotel sector with thousands of fans opting to stay in Dubai and fly to Doha for individual matches.\n\nObservers said the removal of the alcohol tax could be offset by the planned introduction of a 9 per cent corporate tax in June. The 30 per cent tax on alcohol sales is one of many “stealth taxes” generating revenue in the absence of income tax.\n\nDubai has already benefited from the United Arab Emirates’ introduction of a 5 per cent sales tax in 2018. “The impact on government revenue is expected to be limited, especially with the recovery in the non-oil sectors and from earlier fiscal reforms,” said Malik.",

    "date": "2022-12-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "The Tetris-like Atlantis The Royal luxury development is among the newer landmarks on Palm Jumeirah, the artificial island that is home to Dubai’s elite. When the first of its 231 deluxe residences was offered for sale seven years ago, a two-bedroom apartment could be bought for a mere Dh5.5mn ($1.5mn).\n\nBut demand has soared since the pandemic, with owners inundated with requests to sell homes that come complete with swimming pools and terraces offering panoramic views. This summer, one of Atlantis The Royal’s penthouses, which sprawls over three floors, sold for Dh180mn.\n\n“2020 and 2021 have been incredible years,” said Philippe Zuber, chief executive of Kerzner International, its developer. “Dubai was one of those global destinations managing the pandemic extremely well, so it put Dubai on the map.”\n\nAtlantis The Royal’s popularity among buyers epitomises the boom in deluxe properties in Dubai as a new generation of rich residents competes over a shrinking pool of luxurious homes.\n\nThe influx includes Europeans seeking a sun-kissed, low-tax life; financiers fleeing Asia’s coronavirus restrictions; Indians putting down roots thanks to an attractive new long-term residency programme; and Russians flocking to one of the few havens open to them since the war in Ukraine.\n\nPrices are set to continue rising next year, according to local brokerage Unique Properties, which has forecast a 13.5 per cent increase in the cost of prime properties in 2023.\n\nThe boom has trickled down to all segments of the market. Property group CBRE said residential transactions in the 11 months to November topped the record set in the same period of 2009 — just before Dubai’s debt-fuelled property bubble burst amid global financial crisis. Rents, meanwhile, have risen by more than a quarter over the same period.\n\nYet it is the top-end that has attracted the hottest competition. Emirates Hills, an area synonymous with Dubai’s uber-elite, has been hugely oversubscribed since the pandemic sent demand soaring, according to Leigh Borg, an executive partner at Luxhabitat Sotheby’s International Realty.\n\n“Dubai has always attracted millionaires and billionaires, but now they’re moving here full time and they want the biggest and best homes,” said Borg, who has sold 10 properties in the area worth a total of Dh420mn this year alone.\n\nValuations in Emirates Hills were at all-time highs, he noted, while fewer than 5 per cent of its more than 600 properties were actually up for sale.\n\nHis offerings include an eco-friendly solar-powered contemporary villa in Emirates Hills’ most exclusive street priced at Dh349mn. “This is what the new wave of buyers are looking for: a turnkey solution, something ready to move in,” he said.\n\nYet older villas that can be renovated are also popular, with some doubling in value since the pandemic to sell for Dh110mn or higher.\n\nThe surge in demand from the wealthiest buyers convinced Dubai’s largest private sector developer Damac to pivot towards luxury offerings.\n\nHussain Sajwani, its chief executive, picked up on the shift last year, when homes at the group’s new Cavalli Tower were snapped up for Dh20m, and a penthouse there sold for more than three times this figure. He said that he expected properties in its new luxury project next to Dubai’s man-made canal to fetch up to Dh70mn.\n\nRussians, who are often attracted to waterfront apartments, have become important customers, although more established European markets were still the largest customer segment. Yet Sajwani said he expected a new influx from China, as Beijing continues to grapple with coronavirus. “Our next boom will come from the Chinese,” he predicted.\n\nDevelopers say the limited stock of upmarket properties will ensure that the boom is sustained, although new projects are expected to come on stream soon.\n\nForemost among them is the Palm Jebel Ali, another man-made island that is larger than the original Palm Jumeirah. Yet the project developed by government-owned Nakheel also offers a cautionary tale about the perils of property investment in Dubai.\n\nLaunched in the early 2000s, the construction of Palm Jebel Ali was put on hold during the financial crisis and then delayed until a judicial committee cancelled the project this year. It is now being relaunched under a new master plan that reflects today’s much-higher valuation. The first of hundreds of villas and thousands of apartments will go on sale as early as next month.\n\nHundreds of customers held on to their original contracts for years, hoping one day to move in. Others who purchased their units in the hot secondary market could lose millions of dirhams. A group of aggrieved investors has petitioned Dubai’s ruler for recompense.\n\n“I’m bewildered they cancelled the project after 19 years and at the same time launched it again with a different name at [prices] five times higher than what they sold it for originally,” said Muhammad Azzam, one of those to launch a claim. “With this action, investor security loses its meaning in Dubai.”\n\nNakheel has said it is offering up to one and a half times the initial payment to invest in upcoming projects on the new Palm but that it will not refund sums paid in private transactions. “Settlements will . . . not be based on secondary market transactions which did not involve the company,” it said.",

    "date": "2022-12-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UAE is to open trade talks with Ukraine, seeking to boost economic ties despite the Russian invasion.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has halved bilateral trade, but officials hoped that sealing this economic partnership would restore this lost trade, especially in food stuffs, and eventually more than double trade beyond prewar levels.\n\n“We want to boost trade by eliminating trade barriers, customs, fees, standardisation, etc — this will bring huge potential for doubling of exports and imports,” said Thani Al Zeyoudi, the UAE’s minister of state for foreign trade. “This is a very conservative assessment — we hope to go beyond doubling. UAE foreign trade is growing fast, and we plan to bring our model to Ukraine.”\n\nThe talks come amid western pressure on the UAE, an ally of both US and Russia, for its neutral stance in the war. Abu Dhabi has abstained on some UN resolutions relating to the war and Dubai has become a haven for Russian money. The UAE said it welcomed investment from any source that is not subject to UN sanctions. Financial institutions in the country said they also comply with western sanctions on individuals and companies affiliated with the Kremlin.\n\nThe Gulf monarchy said the trade talks represented “another key component” in its efforts “to help reinvigorate the national economy of Ukraine”.\n\nUkraine, an important supplier of staples such as grains to the Middle East, signed more than $3bn in trade and investment pledges during President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit to the UAE in February 2021. Ukraine was the second most important source for wheat for the UAE, which imports 90 per cent of its food.\n\nOfficials said the beginning of talks towards a “comprehensive economic partnership agreement” were rooted in longstanding plans to boost trade and investment globally and were unrelated to politics.\n\n“This is part of our economic diversification process,” said Zeyoudi. “Ukraine will be a gateway to many European nations and is a step towards penetrating the European market.”\n\nIn 2021, non-oil trade between the UAE and Ukraine amounted to around $905mn, a 28 per cent increase over 2020. UAE investment in Ukraine was $243mn in 2021, with Ukrainian flows into the UAE totalling $84mn in 2020. The UAE’s trade with Russia amounted to around $4bn in 2021.\n\n“The UAE has earned a well-deserved reputation as a prominent international trade and logistics hub,” Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister of Ukraine and economy minister, said in a statement. “At the same time, Ukraine is known for its role as a global food security guarantor and a growing IT powerhouse. That makes our economies complementary.”\n\nThe UAE’s trade negotiations with Ukraine will start in the coming weeks and follow the UAE’s conclusion of similar deals with India, Indonesia and Israel. Talks are ongoing with Turkey, Georgia and Cambodia.\n\nThe Gulf monarchy has been pursuing these pacts in an effort to diversify its economy away from oil and gas, with the aim of doubling the size of its economy to $820bn by 2030.",

    "body": "Football fan Chris Leek was born in 1958, the last time Wales qualified for the Fifa World Cup. “All I ever wanted was to see Wales in the World Cup — now I can be happy for the rest of my life,” he said of the principality’s participation in this year’s tournament in Qatar.\n\nLeek plays alto saxophone with The Barry Horns, a brass band made up of 11 Welsh football fans. Seven of them have travelled to the Gulf to play at Wales’ matches in Qatar, not only to try to galvanise the crowd with their music but also to promote Welsh identity and independence from the UK.\n\nBut like thousands of other supporters, they have based themselves in nearby Dubai, the regional trade hub in the United Arab Emirates, making the tiring day-long trip to the Qatari capital Doha via hour-long shuttle flights connecting the cities during the tournament.\n\nFans from the participating countries have opted for Dubai’s lively nightlife scene over Doha’s buttoned-down atmosphere. Qatar’s last-minute decision to ban alcohol sales around the stadiums only served to underline the country’s more conservative culture.\n\nThe party atmosphere starts at Dubai’s two airports, where outlets have been so busy this week that some ran out of McDonald’s and Heineken beer.\n\nAcross the city, fan zones have been bustling with supporters from every nation, reflecting the diverse nature of Dubai’s expatriate population, which makes up 90 per cent of the 3.5mn population.\n\nIn the downtown financial centre, bankers have been swapping suits for football shirts to watch matches at its fan park, where companies have been renting out lounges at $5,500 for 20 people, which includes food and booze.\n\nWith 60 daily shuttle flights between Dubai and Doha, up to 350,000 people could be transported from the region’s tourism hub throughout the tournament, which expects to host about 1.5mn visitors.\n\nThe deluge of fans comes in the middle of Dubai’s tourism season, when visitors flock there in search of winter sun. The government-owned airport operator says passenger throughput has eclipsed pre-pandemic numbers, with traffic surpassing 6mn a month during the third quarter. Dubai’s Emirates airline has recorded a 228 per cent rise in passengers in its first-half results.\n\n“Dubai has extremely strong demand at this time of year and I’m sure there will be people travelling through Dubai to the World Cup,” said Issam Kazim, chief executive of Dubai Tourism. “This tournament will be a boost for the entire region.”\n\nBut officials say the number of fans who are visiting the emirate with the sole purpose of catching games in Qatar is likely in the low tens of thousands, or the equivalent of an uptick in hotel occupancy of up to three percentage points. Many match tickets have been sold to expatriates in the Gulf, including some of the 100,000-plus Britons living in the UAE.\n\nMany hotels are now operating at near full capacity anyway as travel demand has soared. In September, the last available statistics, average occupancy at the roughly 140,000 available rooms across the emirate was 71 per cent with the average daily rate around a quarter higher than 2019.\n\nDubai-based Expat Sport has brought in about 2,000 fans through its hotel and flight packages for supporters who have tickets to attend games in Qatar. Fans from South America, India and the UK are staying in the popular Palm Island district of Dubai, shuttling to and from Qatar on flights booked by the company, which also sells World Cup hospitality packages for UAE-based expatriates.\n\n“There’s general excitement, it’s suddenly here,” said Sue Holt, executive director of the sports tourism group. “People who weren’t thinking about it are saying ‘why don’t we just go’.”\n\nFor visitors such as The Barry Horns’ founder Fez Watkins, Dubai also offered a chance to visit “amazing” clubs where the blend of south Asian and Arabic-influenced rhythms was “absolutely, mind-blowingly good”.\n\nLocal well-wishers have been lending the band sound equipment and drums for the matches in Doha as well as their gigs for expatriate enthusiasts at hotels and events at the British embassies in Qatar and Dubai.\n\nThe group, formed in 2011 when the national team’s fortunes were at a low point, plays tunes such as the military march “Men of Harlech” and Depeche Mode’s “Just Can’t Get Enough”, to raise the morale of the “Red Wall” of Welsh fans decked out in national colours and bucket hats.\n\n“There have been a few hassles, but it’s been great overall — arriving at the airport with the fans from likes of Mexico and Argentina has been a joyful World Cup experience,” said Watkins.\n\n“The World Cup has always been like a party we were never invited to. And now we’re finally part of it.”",

The ADAA monitors government entities and state-related companies to promote transparency.\n\nKPMG Lower Gulf said its application to renew its licence to carry out statutory audits “was returned asking for more information” and that “the recent status change does not affect our current statutory audit engagements”.\n\n“We are actively engaging with them to address all technical enquiries,” the firm said, adding that it was “committed to delivering the highest-quality audit service”.\n\nPera, who will take over on January 1, was elected after a vote by equity partners in the Lower Gulf firm. He beat competition from audit head Osama Harmouche and consultant Wejdi Harzallah.\n\nThe election was overseen by a KPMG committee and law firm Freshfields after accusations that a previous voting process to extend Haffar’s tenure until 2027 was a “sham”.\n\nPera will be tasked with responding to the recommendations of a governance review by Freshfields and reassuring the firm’s 3,400 clients in the region, including the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company, that the business will be stabilised.\n\nSeveral partners left the firm after the unrest at KPMG Lower Gulf, with rivals trying to poach unhappy partners and staff.\n\nPera previously led the Lower Gulf audit division in the wake of the Abraaj scandal but was removed from the post at the start of this year before being appointed interim head of tax.\n\nHe said he was “deeply grateful” to Haffar and hoped to “build on his achievements”. “We continue to strive towards being the most trusted and trustworthy firm of choice for our clients.”",

    "body": "The UAE’s president is to meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow as the Russian leader steps up his attacks on Ukraine with a series of missile strikes.\n\nThe visit of Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, known as MBZ, follows last week’s decision by the Opec cartel and allied producers including Russia to cut the group’s daily production target by 2mn barrels. The move, designed to boost global oil prices, will help Moscow financially, further undermining strained relations between Washington and its traditional Gulf allies.\n\nThe White House declared Opec had “aligned with Russia”, even as Moscow was escalating its offensive against Ukraine. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen criticised the decision as “unhelpful and unwise” for the global economy.\n\nPutin and Sheikh Mohammed, who is also the Abu Dhabi ruler, will discuss regional and international issues of common interest, the UAE’s state-run WAM agency said.\n\nMore than 80 Russian missiles were fired at targets across Ukraine on Monday, hitting a playground, a bridge and other civilian infrastructure in central Kyiv and more than a dozen cities, killing at least 10 people and injuring more than 60, according to Ukrainian authorities. Putin described the attacks as retaliation for the damage done, on Saturday, to the Kerch bridge linking Russia and the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which the Russian president unilaterally annexed in 2014.\n\nThree people briefed on the UAE’s position said Sheikh Mohammed’s visit to Moscow was in line with his intent to engage with all sides in the Ukrainian conflict and was made in the spirit of mediation. The Gulf state privately opposed the cut during the Opec meeting, only to be overruled by other members, they insisted.\n\nThe UAE, a close US ally, has sought to display a neutral stance over the war in Ukraine. In the early days of Russia’s invasion in February, it irritated its western allies by abstaining on UN votes criticising Moscow. But last month it backed a UN Security Council resolution condemning Russia’s annexation referendums in four Ukrainian regions staged by Kremlin proxies as “illegal”.\n\nSheikh Mohammed is one of the global figures able to maintain a line of communication with Putin, analysts said. “MBZ can talk to Putin rationally and stop the drift to a nuclear confrontation,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati commentator.\n\nThe UAE has in recent years played a role of mediator in disputes in the Middle East and normalised diplomatic and trade ties with Israel.\n\nPutin may also meet Recep Tayyip Erdoğan this week, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. The Turkish president has served as a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow to seal a deal to resume grain shipping in the Black Sea. Both Putin and Erdoğan are expected to visit Kazakhstan for a summit on Russia and Central Asia on Friday.\n\nIn Washington, frustration with Saudi Arabia continued to mount. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, on Monday called for suspending US co-operation with Saudi Arabia until it changes its position on Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\n“The United States must immediately freeze all aspects of our co-operation with Saudi Arabia, including any arms sales and security co-operation beyond what is absolutely necessary to defend US personnel and interests,” he said.\n\nHe said he would not approve any such requests “until the Kingdom reassesses its position with respect to the war in Ukraine.”\n\nThe forceful statement is an indication of the uphill battle Saudi Arabia faces to repair its reputation in Washington, although it could leave open room for some systems that the US deems necessary for its security.",

    "body": "Joe Biden’s fist-bumping visit to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was always a questionable exercise. Three months later, the US president’s reward has not been the hoped-for increase in oil output, but a headline cut of 2mn barrels a day by the Opec+ group that has allied the oil cartel with Russia since 2016. Five weeks before US midterm elections in which gasoline prices could play a decisive role, this looks like a snub. It also suggests Saudi Arabia is sticking fast to its relationship with Moscow, even as Vladimir Putin escalates his war in Ukraine. The kingdom may feel it is acting in its own and the cartel’s best interests, but its actions may prove a strategic error.\n\nSaudi and Opec officials insist the cuts were not politically motivated. Faced with a likely recession in Europe and elsewhere that will depress demand, they say they are attempting to put a floor under prices, protect revenues and increase capacity. After falling by a quarter since June, global crude prices are, in equivalent terms, also well below the sky-high levels natural gas and coal have reached thanks to Russia’s war.\n\nYet the move to reduce production now is part of a broader struggle for control of the global oil market. Saudi Arabia has been irked by US-led attempts to influence prices. The Biden administration has pushed for price caps on Russian oil — to squeeze Moscow’s revenues — from the G7 big democracies and the EU. Opec sees this as an attempt to shift the balance of power towards consuming nations, and fears such a mechanism could one day be deployed against it.\n\nThe US has also engaged in the largest ever release from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to try to tamp down crude prices, and gas prices at US pumps — an intervention as hefty as Opec’s new cuts. Releases have sometimes run at about 1mn b/d, roughly equivalent to what Opec’s cutbacks will amount to once the underproduction of some members compared to their quotas is factored in.\n\nThe cartel is trying to regain control of the market and demonstrate that it still has the power to set the price. Saudi Arabia is surely engaged in political signalling, too, to a US president who called it a “pariah” after the brutal murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and an administration it feels is giving insufficient support to Riyadh’s security in the region. It aims to show it has other friends, in Beijing, New Delhi and Moscow.\n\nThe Saudi crown prince risks overplaying his hand, as he has often done in the past. China, India and Russia are unlikely to extend anything like the same security protection to Saudi Arabia that the US has done over several decades. Pushing up oil prices now may only deepen any impending recession and the resulting destruction of demand. An irate White House has hinted it may now release even more oil from America’s stockpile. US lawmakers are calling to revive so-called Nopec legislation, which aims to crack down on oil cartels.\n\nThe lesson for the US and western allies is that their partners in the Gulf are not reliable when it comes to energy, and Opec is determined to maximise revenues from an asset for which demand must eventually be slashed by western-led efforts to combat climate change. It sees no obligation in the meantime to provide energy security cheaply to its customers.\n\nWestern consumer nations have few short-term, supply-side, answers other than investing in further fossil fuel production that would run counter to their climate aims. The long-term answer to all the multiple energy and climate problems they now face is the same: to make real efforts, which have so far barely begun, to reduce oil demand — and to speed up the dash to sustainable, green sources.",

    "body": "The White House has accused Opec+ of aligning with Russia after Saudi Arabia led the group in agreeing deep oil production cuts, prompting a backlash from countries battling surging energy inflation triggered by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Opec+ group said it would reduce production targets by 2mn barrels a day, equivalent to 2 per cent of global supply, following its first in-person meeting in two years in Vienna. The actual cut in output is likely to be closer to 1mn b/d as many weaker members have struggled to hit production targets in recent months.\n\nThe decision came despite extensive lobbying by the US government before the meeting and marked a significant breach with the Biden administration, which is seeking to drive down oil and petrol prices ahead of crucial midterm elections in November and to starve Russia of energy revenues.\n\nThe Biden administration criticised the cuts, calling it a “shortsighted decision” at a time when “maintaining a global supply of energy is of paramount importance”. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One it was “clear” Opec+ was “aligning with Russia”.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman dismissed suggestions that the cartel’s cuts would hurt consumers, arguing that the group’s actions were intended to encourage long-term investment in oil production.\n\n“Show me where is the act of belligerence,” he said in response to questions following the announcement. Energy markets required “guidance without which investment would not happen”.\n\nIn response to the Opec+ decision, the US said it would continue to release oil from its strategic stockpiles “as appropriate” and that it was exploring “additional responsible actions” to lift domestic oil supply.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will also work with Congress on legislation to “reduce Opec’s control over energy prices”, the statement added, in an apparent reference to anti-cartel legislation known as NOPEC that has long been considered by US lawmakers but has not been passed.\n\nOil prices have risen more than 5 per cent since Friday in the run-up to the meeting, and international benchmark Brent edged higher to $93.95 a barrel after news of the cut.\n\nAnalysts said Saudi Arabia’s move, which will damage western governments’ efforts to curb Russian oil income used to sustain its war in Ukraine, marked a significant moment in Riyadh’s 75-year energy alliance with the US.\n\n“Saudi Arabia has set Opec on a collision course with the free world. They have sided with Russia in the name of protective oil market management — just as consumers across the world are battling inflation and the rising cost of living,” said Bill Farren-Price, a veteran Opec watcher at consultancy Enverus. “There are bound to be political consequences for Riyadh.”\n\nThe cartel’s decision came hours after EU countries agreed to a US plan to impose a price cap on Russian oil exports, an effort by western countries to drive down prices of crude and fuel. Saudi Arabia and other Opec Gulf countries fear this plan would reduce oil prices across the board and could even be used against them in future.\n\n“This is hugely political and a very clear signal of Opec’s discontent regarding the price cap,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects. “Regardless of whether the price cap is actually effective, they see this as a dangerous precedent.”\n\nOpec secretary-general Haitham al-Ghais from Kuwait argued the group was providing “security” and “stability” for energy markets.\n\n“Everything has a price,” he said. “Energy security has a price as well.”\n\nUnited Arab Emirates energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said the group was focused on averting an oil price crash as in 2008, and did not want to get involved with discussions over Russia’s role in the market.\n\n“In Europe, they have their own story, in Russia they have their own story. We can’t be siding with this country or that country,” Mazrouei told the Financial Times.",

    "body": "Dubai developer Nakheel is nearing a debt restructuring deal worth $4.6bn, as the group behind landmarks such as Palm Jumeirah accelerates plans to tap into surging demand for property in the Gulf emirate.\n\nThe government-owned group has been negotiating with a group of lenders, including local banks Emirates NBD, Mashreq and Dubai Islamic Bank, according to people familiar with the matter. The negotiations are set to refinance 11bn UAE dirhams ($3bn) of existing debt and to raise Dh6bn ($1.63bn) to kickstart development of Palm Jebel Ali, a stalled seafront project.\n\nDemand for coastal properties has risen in recent years thanks to Dubai’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with the government keeping the economy relatively open. Russians have also settled in the United Arab Emirates as a haven from the war in Ukraine.\n\nAs the wealthy once again flock to Dubai, high energy prices are fuelling a broader boom in the oil-rich Gulf states. Financial groups are moving to the emirate as a base to service the region, where excess revenues are cushioning the blow of inflation felt more acutely elsewhere.\n\n“Nakheel is paying a lower spread and getting more money for new projects, including Palm Jebel Ali,” said one banker on the deal.\n\nNakheel’s Palm Jumeirah, the man-made island synonymous with Dubai glamour, is one of the most expensive districts in the city, registering the highest average sales rate in August — but there is barely any space left for new developments.\n\nNakheel plans to build 1,700 villas and 6,000 apartments on Palm Jebel Ali, which is one and a half times bigger than Palm Jumeirah, people aware of the matter said.\n\nAverage sales prices in the year to August were up 9 per cent — with apartments up 8 per cent and villas 16 per cent, CBRE said in a report earlier this month. Valuations nonetheless remain below the last peak in 2014, after which lower oil prices triggered a slump in regional economies.\n\nIn August, transaction volumes increased 70 per cent compared with the month in 2021. For the year to date, volumes have reached their highest level since 2009, when a previous bubble burst during the global financial crisis.\n\nNakheel was at the heart of Dubai’s debt calamity that year, when the emirate had to turn to neighbouring Abu Dhabi for $20bn in bailout loans to ward off a damaging bond default.\n\nBut analysts warn that this property boom may also be running out of steam.\n\nTaimur Khan, head of research at CBRE in Dubai, said average rents were registering almost record growth, rising nearly a quarter in the year to August. However, with sales growth already receding, “we may see the rental growth rate start to moderate in the not too distant future”, he said.",

    "date": "2022-09-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Teachers returning for the new academic year in the United Arab Emirates were struck by a new bureaucratic demand. In a new code of conduct, one clause in particular jumped out: “refrain . . . from discussing gender identity, homosexuality or any other behaviour deemed unacceptable to UAE society”.\n\nThe directive has sent a chill through the teaching community in English-language schools, where many of the staff are from the UK and Ireland.\n\nSchool management, responding to the perceived clampdown, have removed rainbow flags from classrooms and told teachers to remove rainbow wristbands. Children have been told that discussion of topics such as same-sex marriage and homosexuality is no longer allowed.\n\n“Every time we walk into the classroom, we are worried now,” said one teacher.\n\nFor many, the new school directive was just the latest sign that the culture wars and clashes over identity politics in the west have arrived in the conservative Gulf states.\n\nLast week, Saudi Arabia led all six Gulf states, including the UAE, in demanding that streaming group Netflix remove shows deemed un-Islamic. The call followed a local media campaign accusing Netflix of promoting homosexuality, a criminal offence in many countries in the region.\n\nThe clashes are particularly acute in the UAE, which has a big expatriate population. The government there has liberalised laws on alcohol and divorce to attract foreign workers but it also needs to be mindful of the concerns of conservative ethnic Emiratis who are fearful that homosexuality could be decriminalised next.\n\nThe UAE, one of the more liberal Gulf states, has largely adopted a “don’t’ ask, don’t tell” policy, tolerating gay people who hide their sexuality. Yet increasing promotion of equality in western companies and communities has forced the issue into the open.\n\nMultinational executives have lobbied the government to decriminalise homosexuality in an effort to broaden the pool of employees willing to relocate to the UAE. An inclusive work culture, they argue, is also vital to attract and retain staff, especially in knowledge-based industries targeted by the government as part of its strategy to diversify the economy away from oil.\n\n“For cultural and creative industries to flourish, one must ensure public liberties, personal freedoms, free access to private funding — and tolerance, including for LGBTQ rights,” said Mazen Hayek, a Dubai-based media consultant.\n\nLast week, US law firm Baker McKenzie cut ties with senior UAE lawyer Habib Al Mulla over Twitter posts he made in relation to a viral video in which young women gave their thoughts about contemporary womanhood. In the posts, he had suggested that other Emirati women should sue the video makers for misrepresenting UAE society. Mulla, who comments on social and legal issues from his popular Twitter account, had also previously described homosexuality as “ugly”.\n\nBaker McKenzie issued a press release signalling the end of its partnership with Mulla, saying it wanted “an inclusive work environment for all”.\n\nMulla refused to apologise for his comments, which he described as rooted in his religion. “As a Muslim, eastern culture here, this issue homosexuality is a no, no — society won’t accept it,” he said, echoing the views of many conservative Emiratis. “Live your own life, but don’t try to force that culture.”\n\nThe UAE brooks little dissent. As a result, it may be easier for citizens to voice outrage over homosexuality and other social issues than more overtly political topics, said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher at Oxford university, referring to the normalisation of relations with Israel, unemployment and the rising cost of living.\n\n“LGBTQ is a convenient and non-divisive topic for many Emiratis, which they can offload their rage on to without appearing to be making political statements or demands,” she said. “Many of these people expressing outrage on social media know they have the backing of key individuals in government.”\n\nThe societal backlash is also being felt by Dubai’s thriving underground gay community. “People travel across the region to party here because it has always been seen as a more tolerant safe haven,” said one gay resident. “You would see women dressed as men. Men in make-up. You name it.”\n\nBut the parties had dried up in recent months, with attendees afraid of sparking the interest of the authorities, the resident added.\n\nIn English-language international schools, teachers remain on edge, as conservative parents complain to the authorities over liberal attitudes towards homosexuality and gender identity.\n\nOne teacher was encouraged to leave after a pupil told their parents that they thought he was gay. Another received a fine for “cross dressing” when he wore clothes of a female literary character to celebrate world book day.\n\nThe situation, added the teacher who had voiced their worry, was “difficult for any educator”.",

    "body": "Baker McKenzie said it was working to ensure a “co-operative and swift separation” from its partner in the United Arab Emirates after controversy over social media posts in which he described homosexuality as “ugly”.\n\nThe US law firm said on Friday that Habib Al Mulla would set up a firm independent from Baker McKenzie once the separation had been completed by early next year.\n\nAbu Dhabi-based Borys Dackiw, head of investigations, compliance and ethics in the Middle East, will lead Baker McKenzie UAE on an interim basis, focused on transactional and advisory practices.\n\nThe case highlights the sharpening divide between the values of western corporations that have flocked to the expatriate-majority UAE to take advantage of its regional hub status and the more conservative ethics of many Emirati nationals.\n\nMulla, who is one of the country’s most distinguished lawyers but also comments on social issues from his popular Twitter account, sparked controversy in recent weeks over social media posts regarding Emirati identity and homosexuality. His tweets attracted widespread support among many of his compatriots.\n\nBaker McKenzie, which has a 40-year history in the region, announced a corporate divorce from its UAE partner last week, saying it wanted to “ensure an inclusive work environment for all” and that Mulla’s social media comments did not represent those of the firm.\n\nThe UAE has introduced multiple social and economic reforms to entice more foreigners as the government seeks to boost growth and diversify the economy away from oil. Restrictions on alcohol and cohabitation of unmarried couples have been eased, while foreigners can now set up businesses without the need for a local UAE partner. The government also shifted its weekend to align with global markets.\n\nHowever, homosexuality remains illegal in the UAE as well as other Gulf states, which this month all demanded that Netflix remove “un-Islamic” content.\n\nThe emirate of Dubai has swung out of the pandemic strongly, enjoying an influx of new, wealthy residents, including Russians and Ukrainians fleeing the war. The Dubai International Financial Centre, a city-centre district popular among banks and law firms, is luring new businesses ranging from hedge funds to financial technology firms. In the first half of 2022, the DIFC recorded its fastest job creation growth since its inception in 2004.\n\nBaker McKenzie, which merged with Mulla’s firm in 2013, also said it was considering moving its Dubai office into the DIFC to service its global financial clients.",

    "blurb": "Call to address ‘massive crisis’ after reports of nepotism, cronyism and culture of fear ",
    "date": "2022-09-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "A group of senior partners at KPMG has urged the firm’s global bosses to suspend the leadership at its United Arab Emirates business, citing nepotism, cronyism and a culture of fear allegedly stoked by the chief executive.\n\nThe demands, which include a call for KPMG International to parachute in a temporary chief executive from the firm’s global operations, were set out in an email to some of KPMG International’s top executives.\n\nThe email, sent to recipients including KPMG International’s chair Bill Thomas, vice-chair Carl Carande, global general counsel Anne Collins and global head of people Nhlamu Dlomu, states that it represents the views of ten capital partners at KPMG Lower Gulf.\n\nIt highlights a series of criticisms of Lower Gulf chief executive Nader Haffar and his leadership team, including his appointment of his brother-in-law as head of clients and markets last year without disclosing their relationship to partners. KPMG Lower Gulf has 3,400 clients, including the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and sovereign investment funds ADQ and Mubadala.\n\nThe partners call on KPMG International to bring in a turnround team to support the business to address the “massive crisis” brewing in the local firm. KPMG International declined to comment.\n\nIn the email, they accuse Haffar of surrounding himself with cronies in key positions and fostering a “fear culture” with many partners afraid they will lose their jobs if they express “dissenting views”. They also call for the suspension of the board, alleging that its independence is being undermined because some independent directors receive unusually large salaries of $500,000 or more.\n\nKPMG International should establish an independent committee to assess Haffar’s performance, the email says, and install an acting chief executive from the international organisation.\n\nThe partners also highlight concerns about falling profits, which have hit their pay. At the start of Haffar’s tenure as KPMG Lower Gulf chief executive in 2018, average profits per partner were around $800,000, according to the email and current and former partners. This has fallen to a projected $450,000 per partner for 2022. Partner bonuses have not yet been fully paid for 2021 because of “cash flow issues”, the email states.\n\nThey blame the decline in profitability on Haffar’s lack of “commercial acumen”, the hiring of expensive senior people who have increased overheads without improving profitability, and expensive PR campaigns aiming to boost the CEO’s image in the region.\n\nTheir email also highlights a charitable contribution by KPMG Lower Gulf in April of around $272,000 to the One Billion Meals campaign, an initiative set up by the UAE prime minister’s philanthropic foundation to ease global hunger. A former partner described the donation, which was widely publicised, as an “extraordinary charitable contribution for a firm our size” and “very unusual”, adding: “This did not have a business purpose, this had a Nader purpose.”\n\nKPMG Lower Gulf said it was “very proud of the contribution that the company and over 300 of its employees made to the UAE’s “1 Billion Meals” initiative . . . The size of this contribution was in line with many other local and international brands.”\n\nIt added: “Over the past five years, and despite the impact of Covid, KPMG Lower Gulf has consistently grown year on year almost doubling its revenue, the number of partners and its employees.”\n\nThe email follows a chaotic summer at KPMG Lower Gulf, which announced in July that it would rerun an election for Haffar’s position as chair and chief executive following allegations that the previous process had been a sham. It also said it would hire a law firm to review its governance after the Financial Times reported criticism of its leadership and the removal of partners who had challenged Haffar.\n\nBut some partners believe the measures are simply window dressing. The email said that if KPMG International does not step in, “the culprits will be the judges and the jury here”.\n\nKPMG is structured as a network of locally-owned partnerships that pay a fee to KPMG International, which manages the brand and sets global minimum standards.\n\nKPMG Lower Gulf is based in Dubai and has around 60 partners in total, of which roughly 40 are capital partners who own the 1,300-person operation.\n\nThe email will increase pressure on KPMG International, which has been accused of ignoring whistleblower complaints. The firm has previously said it takes all reports seriously and takes appropriate action.\n\nThe partners declined to identify themselves to the FT because of fear of retaliation from KPMG Lower Gulf but provided copies of internal communications to demonstrate they work at the firm.\n\nA number of current and former partners at KPMG Lower Gulf contacted by the FT said they agreed with the contents of the email.",

    "body": "The family of a British prisoner in Dubai has urged foreign investors such as the lender JPMorgan and fund manager BlackRock to divest their holdings in Dubai Islamic Bank, which it blames for the extended detention of its relative.\n\nRyan Cornelius, 68, has been imprisoned in the Gulf’s commercial capital for 14 years after being arrested in 2008 along with three other people, including his former business partner Charles Ridley.\n\nAll four were convicted of defrauding DIB, which is part-owned by the Dubai government, in 2011.\n\nAt the end of their sentences in 2018, following an application by the bank, a Dubai judge extended their detention by 20 years until they settled $430mn in alleged debt. The judge retroactively used a 2009 law that provides for the imposition of a prison sentence for the non-repayment of fraudulent gains from government-related entities.\n\nThe offence for which Cornelius was convicted predated the 2009 law.\n\nThe family of Cornelius, whose health is deteriorating, has been waging a campaign for his release. It has called on the UK to impose sanctions for alleged human rights abuses on DIB’s chair Mohammed Al Shaibani as regards Cornelius’s disproportionate sentence and what it sees as the cruel treatment and arbitrary detention in jail.\n\nShaibani is also a senior government official in the emirate.\n\nThe family said DIB applied to extend Cornelius’s sentence and, as his effective jailer, could seek to overturn the judgment.\n\nDIB said it had acted “properly, in the interests of its shareholders and in accordance with applicable laws at all times”.\n\nThe English High Court has found that these two individuals are guilty of misappropriation of the bank’s money through fraud, DIB said.\n\n“This dispute has been the subject of detailed review in two jurisdictions and the unanimous conclusion of the judicial proceedings in both England and Dubai is that these men are guilty of fraud,” it added.\n\nA group of British MPs, including former Conservative party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Stephen Kinnock, have also urged the UK government to “display the same energy” in Cornelius’s case as it did in securing the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe from detention in Iran.\n\nThe UN’s working group on arbitrary detention this year concluded that Cornelius had been held arbitrarily and called for his immediate release and the payment of reparations.\n\nCornelius has argued that judicial means were used to force him into bankruptcy. He had been repaying instalments on a restructuring agreement on the $501mn DIB loan until he was detained in 2008, thereby defaulting. The bank foreclosed on the loan’s collateral, a polo-themed real estate development then valued at about $1bn. DIB has argued the loan restructuring was illegal.\n\nBill Browder, a longstanding Kremlin critic who lobbied for the Global Magnitsky Act, which authorises sanctions on foreign officials identified as human rights offenders, said: “This is a total travesty of justice, where a bank can hold an individual hostage over an alleged non-payment of debt, even when it doesn’t actually look like there is money owed.”\n\nIn a letter to BlackRock, Ryan Cornelius’s wife Heather noted the fund manager’s commitment to “engaging with companies on how they manage the human rights issues that are inherent in their businesses”.\n\n“I urge you to divest yourself of your holdings in the DIB,” she wrote. “Use your influence as a significant shareholder in DIB to compel them to take all necessary steps to secure the release of my husband.”\n\nCornelius has written similar letters to other global companies identified as having some of the largest institutional shareholdings in DIB. These include JPMorgan, US investment manager Vanguard, British wealth manager St James’s Place and Norges Bank Investment Management, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund.\n\nDiplomats have said it is difficult for the UK government to interfere in the legal processes of a foreign country. The UK and United Arab Emirates have close historic ties.\n\nBlackRock, JPMorgan and St James’s Place declined to comment. Vanguard did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNBIM said it was studying the letter.\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office did not provide a statement for publication.",

    "date": "2022-09-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Serbia has turned to the IMF and the United Arab Emirates for help in handling its soaring debt costs in a move that highlights the impact of higher interest rates and the economic downturn on Europe’s emerging markets.\n\nThe IMF on Tuesday confirmed to the Financial Times that Belgrade had called for discussions on a so-called standby arrangement. Such an arrangement would allow Serbia to draw on IMF support in the event that Belgrade could not sell its bonds to investors.\n\nAuthorities hope that having the Fund’s assurances in place will prevent further rises in the country’s borrowing costs on international markets, which have more than tripled since the turn of the year from less than 2 per cent to more than 6 per cent.\n\n“You don’t want to have a standby arrangement with the IMF if you’re a stable country but maybe it’s better to eat humble pie now to make sure you are not refinancing at more than 6 per cent,” said Tamara Basic Vasiljev, senior economist at Oxford Economics.\n\nNews of the IMF request comes after Abu Dhabi offered Serbia a $1bn loan at 3 per cent. “If we were to enter the financial market, it would cost us at least two-and-a-half times more,” said Aleksandar Vučić, Serbia’s president, in a statement published on Monday, adding that Belgrade was facing “resistance by all investors, because it’s mostly western financial investors”.\n\nSerbia is one of several countries in central and eastern Europe, including Hungary and Romania, that have seen their borrowing costs soar on the back of the US Federal Reserve’s and the European Central Bank’s sharp increases in interest rates.\n\nThe country’s most liquid euro-denominated bond was trading with a yield of 6.3 per cent on Tuesday, compared with 1.8 per cent at the end of last year.\n\nWhile financing costs have risen across Europe, riskier borrowers — such as Serbia — have seen yields soar at a far faster rate. The gap between Serbia’s yields and those of Germany has widened, from 2.2 percentage points in January to just under 5 percentage points.\n\nCredit rating agencies have warned Belgrade that its government and banking sector are exposed to funding risk owing to a high share of foreign currency loans. The economic outlook is becoming more downbeat. Its central bank believes a downturn in the eurozone, Serbia’s biggest trading partner, is likely to weigh on growth, while the war in Ukraine has triggered a rise in inflation to 13.2 per cent in the year to August.\n\nSerbia has also become more politically isolated from the rest of Europe since the onset of Russia’s invasion after it refused to join western sanctions against Moscow. The European parliament in its June report on Serbia urged Belgrade to “reassess its economic co-operation with Russia”.\n\nVučić, who was re-elected for a new term as president in April, insists on keeping diplomatic channels to Moscow open even as Serbia continues to angle for eventual EU membership.\n\nAbu Dhabi is already a major investor in Serbia, with UAE companies holding a stake in the national airline and developing a $3.5bn mega-project on the Danube riverfront in Belgrade.\n\nDiscussions with the IMF will continue in the coming weeks.\n\nThe IMF and Belgrade will assess the economic and financial situation and determine the size of the country’s overall financing needs as well as an appropriate policy response, the Fund said.\n\nSerbia agreed a three-year, $1.2bn standby arrangement with the Fund in February 2015 but did not draw on it.",

    "blurb": "Statement follows local media campaign against LGBT+ images, and Egypt also says it will regulate streaming platforms",
    "date": "2022-09-0700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia have threatened legal action against streaming group Netflix if it continues to broadcast shows they deem un-Islamic.\n\nThe statement from a Saudi-led committee of the Gulf Cooperation Council follows a campaign in local media accusing the leading streaming content provider in the region of promoting “homosexuality”.\n\nThe statement did not say which shows were problematic but said that they ran counter to Islam and the law in Gulf countries, and that they included content for children.\n\n“The relevant authorities will monitor the platform’s compliance with these directives, and will take the necessary legal measures if the content continues to broadcast,” the statement said.\n\nHomosexuality is banned in most Arab countries and is widely viewed by their populations as taboo. Authorities in several nations periodically crack down on what they consider LGBT+ behaviour or culture, often after media campaigns.\n\nEgypt, the most populous Arab country, followed suit on Wednesday and announced it would start regulating and licensing streaming platforms such as Netflix and Disney Plus to ensure they “adhere to the norms and values of the country”, a statement by the supreme council for media regulation said.\n\nAn official Saudi television channel had aired a report on Tuesday calling on the government to act against Netflix. “Pay to subscribe to Netflix, and in return your child will watch scenes such as this that violate morality, yes scenes that promote homosexuality among children,” a voiceover says, before showing a blurred image of two female cartoon characters kissing.\n\nThe scene was taken from Netflix’s Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous animated show. The report separately referred to Cuties, a French film about a Muslim girl who joins a dance group and “arouses paedophiles”.\n\nNetflix was forced to apologise in 2020 over promotional material for Cuties after a petition accused the channel of sexualising adolescents.\n\nNetflix shares collapsed early this year after the company reported losing subscribers. The shares have recovered on third-quarter earnings and growth in subscriptions, although they are still well below last year’s prices. The group has retained its leading position in the Middle East, where it faces competition from regional streaming groups such as Shahid and Starz Play.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what legal measures the Gulf countries could take against Netflix, or how the company intended to react. The governments already block access to some media companies and sexually explicit content.\n\nA Netflix spokesperson was not available immediately for comment. A spokesperson for the Saudi General Commission for Audiovisual Media, which had issued the statement, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe streaming service has taken down or restricted content in the past at the request of governments, including an episode of a comedy show to which Riyadh objected.\n\nEarlier this year, Saudi Arabia confiscated from stores rainbow-coloured toys and clothes it said promoted homosexuality. In June, the United Arab Emirates forced Amazon to restrict sales and search results relating to LGBT+ issues, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe crackdown came amid unease among conservative Saudis over social reforms in the once ultra-conservative kingdom that have included the introduction of mixed audiences at concerts and cinemas.\n\nIn the socially liberal and largely expatriate-populated UAE, authorities have had a pushback from some Emiratis on social issues. A rumoured potential decriminalisation of homosexuality prompted a backlash from many citizens. Social media users have also criticised foreign embassies for raising the rainbow flag during Pride week.\n\nIn Egypt, authorities have regularly arrested people accused of homosexuality, including a round-up of concert goers in 2017 after they raised rainbow flags at a show.\n\nAdditional reporting by Alex Barker in London and Simeon Kerr in Dubai",

    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has said it plans to return its ambassador to Tehran after a six-year gap, restoring full diplomatic relations with Iran as a regional rapprochement gathers pace.\n\nThe UAE foreign ministry in a statement said its ambassador, Saif Al Zaabi, would return to Tehran “in the coming days”.\n\nHIs return follows three years of tentative diplomacy as the UAE has sought to ease tensions that had boiled over after former US president Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018.\n\nThe UAE, an important US ally, was keen to improve relations after commercial shipping was attacked near UAE waters close to the strategic Strait of Hormuz.\n\nUS officials also blamed Iran and its proxies for drone and missile attacks that struck at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure in 2019, temporarily knocking out about half the kingdom’s crude output.\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, have long accused Shia Iran of being a destabilising force in the region. The rivals found themselves on opposing sides of regional conflicts, notably Yemen, where the Gulf states intervened in 2015 after Iran-allied Houthi rebels ousted the internationally recognised government.\n\nBut after tensions soared in the wake of Trump’s decision to abandon the nuclear deal and pursue a policy of maximum pressure against Iran, the UAE, worried about its own vulnerability to an Iranian attack, sought to repair relations with Tehran and bolster economic ties with the republic.\n\nThe restoration of diplomatic ties follows fellow Gulf state Kuwait’s decision to reinstate its ambassador in Tehran earlier this week. Saudi Arabia has also held several rounds of talks with Iran over the past year in an effort to improve its relations with the Islamic republic.\n\nThe UAE recalled its ambassador in 2016, following Riyadh’s decision to sever ties with Iran in the wake of protests in Tehran that targeted the Saudi mission in the republic’s capital. Iranian demonstrators stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran after the kingdom executed an influential Shia cleric.\n\nWestern powers have been seeking to negotiate a revival of the nuclear pact with Iran that would lead to the US rejoining and easing sanctions on the republic in return for Tehran’s agreeing to strict limits on its nuclear activities.\n\nThe UAE and its Arab allies have been concerned that efforts to revive the 2015 pact have failed to take into consideration efforts to stymie Iran’s ballistic missile programme and what they regard as Iranian interference in the Arab world through proxy militias. But the Gulf state, which is the region’s main trade, tourism and finance hub, also wants to maintain relations with Tehran and develop its economic links with the republic.",

    "blurb": "Volume of residential transactions is at its highest since peak of 2009, says real estate group CBRE",
    "date": "2022-08-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Dubai developers are dusting off plans for long-dormant projects as demand for luxury property surges from a wave of wealthy arrivals to the Gulf city-state.\n\nState and government-related real estate firms are looking to restart projects that failed in the wake of the city’s debt crunch during the global financial crisis. These include the mothballed man-made Palm Jebel Ali island and the stunted towers of Dubai Pearl, a long-delayed development at the entrance to another famous reclaimed island, Palm Jumeirah.\n\nThese developments have long acted as visible reminders of past excesses but are now reviving thanks to a wave of new entrants to the city, from Asian billionaires and cryptocurrency investors to wealthy Russians looking to escape sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDubai-based property consultants Mira Estate said sales to customers from Russia and the former Soviet states had doubled so far this year, compared to the same period in 2021.\n\n“Billionaires and entrepreneurs have been flocking to the UAE in record numbers, leading to a surge in demand for real estate,” said Tamara Getigezheva, Mira’s chief executive. “Most homebuyers are looking for ready units and waterfront properties.”\n\nThe volume of transactions in Dubai’s residential market soared by a third in June 2022 compared to a year before. In the year to June, transactions reached their highest total recorded since the peak in 2009, according to real estate group CBRE.\n\n“Off-plan” sales — of properties that have not been built yet — rose 47 per cent and ready homes by a quarter in the period. Prices increased by 10 per cent in the year to June, while average villa prices were up 19 per cent.\n\nVillas on Palm Jumeirah, the reclaimed island beloved by the city’s wealthy, recorded the highest average sales rate in the city, according to CBRE.\n\nIt was developed by Nakheel, the government-owned firm that was at the heart of Dubai’s financial crisis in 2009 when it nearly defaulted on some of its debt.\n\nDemand for waterfront properties is providing a renaissance for the company, which was previously controlled by state conglomerate Dubai World and now falls under the emirate’s sovereign wealth fund, the Investment Corporation of Dubai.\n\nPalm Jebel Ali, which is one and a half* times larger than Palm Jumeirah, was put on hold in the aftermath of the 2009 crisis.\n\nNakheel’s new management, once it receives government approval, is expected to launch developments on the island to meet demand for beachfront real estate, said three people briefed on the plans.\n\nOver the past few months, Nakheel has been contacting existing investors in the project and offering to buy back their contracts for plots and properties, said six people briefed on the offers. The company declined to comment.\n\nInvestors are being offered financial recompense or credit notes for other Nakheel properties, said three of these people.\n\nCustomers will also be given the opportunity to reinvest their cash in the revived Palm Jebel Ali, they added. In such cases, the company would provide partial compensation as prices on the island are expected to be much higher than for the original project launched two decades ago.\n\n“I bought at a discount, but I don’t want to sell — I want the villa I bought,” said one Dubai businessman. Others who bought at a premium are facing poor recoveries on their investments if they sell back at the original selling price.\n\nDuring its pre-crisis heyday, Nakheel also started developing an even larger man-made coastal project, Palm Deira, which was never fully reclaimed and was then rebranded Deira Islands.\n\nLocated off the city’s old town near the creek, the company is planning an array of commercial, residential and hospitality projects across the four islands, soon to be relaunched as Dubai Islands.\n\nAnother long-abandoned project set for a revival is Dubai Pearl, whose semi-complete structures have been a blot on the skyline for 18 years.\n\nConstruction work on the development of four towers connected on the top floor by a “sky palace” started in 2004 before faltering, leaving investors out of pocket.\n\nThe government recently cancelled the project and put it out to auction among various UAE-based bidders, said four people briefed on the move.\n\nDubai Holding, the conglomerate owned by the ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, won the auction, thereby taking back the land it sold to the original developer in the early 2000s. Investors are now expected to get a quarter to a third of their money back.\n\nDubai Holding did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe deal, if it completes, should provide some closure to thousands of investors who have been battling for recompense for years.\n\n“Getting 25 per cent of my cash back after a 15-year wait isn’t exactly great,” said one. “It’s been a tough way to learn that contracts in Dubai are rarely worth the paper they’re written on. On the other hand, it’s still better than nothing.”\n\n*This has been corrected from three times larger",

    "body": "The Dubai-based group that owns P&O Ferries reported record profit in the first half of the year, a period when the UK company attracted sharp criticism for sacking nearly 800 crew to save money.\n\nDP World said profit climbed 52 per cent to $721mn in the six months to the end of June, thanks to a strong performance from its cargo business.\n\nThe results, released on Thursday, did not break out figures for P&O Ferries, which caused a political firestorm after it ordered ships back to port to sack nearly 800 UK-based crew and replace them with cheaper agency staff on March 17.P&O replaced the sacked sailors with staff on more flexible contracts on an average of £5.50 per hour, well below the UK’s minimum wage but legal because the crew work offshore.\n\nFrances O’Grady, head of the TUC union organisation, said DP World’s record results were “an insult to common decency”.\n\nThe government strongly criticised P&O’s actions, and the Insolvency Service opened a criminal probe into the sackings of staff. But ministers were unable to force P&O to reinstate its former workers.\n\nP&O’s management justified its actions by arguing that the company would go bust without a new business model, and that the decision, which was taken without consulting staff or unions, was the only way to save the business.\n\nAccounts filed in the UK showed P&O Ferries lost a combined £200mn in 2020 and 2021.\n\nSultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the chair and chief executive of DP World, told the Financial Times in May that P&O’s management had done an “amazing job” in restructuring the UK company.\n\nSulayem said the decision had been taken by the P&O board without input from its Dubai parent, and the move could not be reversed.\n\n“The decision [the P&O board] made was their decision . . . I personally feel they were caught with a choice to make . . . I told them the decision was theirs . . . and we did not interfere and tell them what to do,” he said.\n\nDP World itself is a significant investor in the UK, including running the country’s second-biggest shipping terminal in Southampton and third-biggest in London.\n\nThe company on Thursday said it was “positive” on its “ability to continue to deliver sustainable returns”, but warned the outlook for the second half of the year was uncertain due to the weakening economic outlook.",

    "body": "Wizz Air is to restart flights to Moscow through its Abu Dhabi joint venture, drawing warnings that a return to Russia risks reputational damage for the European low-cost airline.\n\nWizz Air Abu Dhabi will restart flights to and from the Russian capital on October 3. It suspended services following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussia has been effectively cut off from flights to and from the UK and EU following a barrage of flight bans and sanctions after the war began in late February.\n\nBut the bans do not apply to Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, which is based in the Middle East and is a joint venture with ADQ, an Abu Dhabi state investment vehicle, which owns 51 per cent.\n\nWizz Air, which is based in Hungary and listed on the London Stock Exchange, said the resumption of flights would bring its Abu Dhabi airline into line with its major rivals in the Middle East such as Emirates and Etihad, which have not stopped flying to Russia.\n\nBut analysts warned of potential reputational damage that could outweigh the extra business.\n\n“While we can see the commercial logic of this, we do feel that the optics look all wrong,” analysts at Goodbody said on Tuesday.\n\nThe stockbroker added that the additional flights would not “really change the dial” in terms of Wizz’s overall network or its flight plans going into this winter.\n\nThe decision could also complicate the retrieval of four Wizz Air planes that are still on the ground in Ukraine after becoming stuck following airspace closures around the time of Russia’s invasion.\n\nWizz Air was one of the carriers worst hit in Europe by airspace bans across Ukraine following the start of the war, with around 7 per cent of its scheduled capacity for summer 2022 originally flying to and from Ukraine, according to Moody’s.\n\nThe airline has expanded across Europe and into areas of Asia as part of an aggressive expansion plan that has quickly lifted it from its central European origins into a major player in European aviation.\n\n“Wizz is growing its fleet rapidly and needs to deploy these aircraft . . . But I would think that there would be other destinations that could have been chosen other than Russia,” said Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt.\n\n“I don’t like the decision to fly to Russia and suspect that there may be some passengers that will avoid flying with them because of it,” he said.\n\nIn a statement, Wizz Air said its Abu Dhabi airline was restarting flights “to meet travel demand for passengers wishing to fly to and from Russia from the UAE capital”.\n\n“Wizz Air Abu Dhabi is a national UAE carrier that operates in line with the UAE’s national regulations and policies,” it said, adding that its UK and Hungarian airlines were still not operating flights to Russia.",

    "body": "PwC’s global crypto leader has left his role at the company to set up a digital assets fund in Dubai, highlighting how the city is attracting cryptocurrency business while other perceived hubs including Singapore and Seoul are increasing scrutiny of the sector.\n\nHenri Arslanian told the Financial Times that Dubai’s “crypto openness” influenced his decision to establish his digital assets fund Nine Blocks Capital Management in the Gulf city, where it has been granted provisional regulatory approval.\n\nThe digital assets fund, which will receive $75mn from its chief backer and main shareholder Nine Masts Capital, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund, has also positioned three portfolio managers in the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe fund’s presence in Dubai comes as the city presses forward with establishing itself as a crypto hub after Asian financial centres such as Singapore and Hong Kong have appeared to turn cold on the sector in the wake of a steep market rout and wave of corporate collapses.\n\n“Hong Kong would have been a natural home for us”, said Arslanian, adding that Nine Blocks had also considered Singapore.\n\n“However, when we looked at the broader ecosystem . . . Cayman and Dubai made a natural choice,” he said, citing factors that included regulatory approval times and the ability to travel easily. Hong Kong still has a mandatory hotel quarantine for most international travellers.\n\nArslanian, who will retain a senior adviser position at PwC, said he had already relocated to Dubai. He added that the fund may later add a base in Asia, but Dubai’s travel links and timezone, just four hours behind Singapore, made it easy to cover the region.\n\nDubai’s crypto push comes in the wake of rival regional hubs Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul putting the nascent industry under increased scrutiny.\n\nSopnendu Mohanty, the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s chief fintech officer, said in June that the city-state would be “brutal and unrelentingly hard” on bad crypto behaviour.\n\nJust days later, Singapore’s watchdog reprimanded Three Arrows Capital, a once-prominent crypto hedge fund that collapsed after a credit crisis hit the digital asset market.\n\nDubai has been opening its doors to some of crypto’s biggest participants. Last year, exchange Binance announced a Virtual Asset License from regulators in Dubai, while rival exchange FTX announced last week that it was approved to operate in the jurisdiction.\n\nArslanian said the city’s “tier-one” regulatory and licensing regime made it attractive to funds such as his, which hope to attract institutional investors.\n\nIn the past two months, Komainu, a crypto group backed by Japanese investment bank Nomura, received provisional approval from Dubai’s digital assets regulator, while crypto exchange CoinMENA was granted a provisional licence.\n\n“I think it [Dubai] is currently the most appealing destination for many major crypto firms,” said Carlton Lai, head of blockchain and cryptocurrency research at Daiwa Capital Markets, adding that the city had moved “very quickly” to hand out licences.\n\n“Compare this with the likes of Singapore and Hong Kong, things have not only moved very slowly, but there has been numerous regulatory flip-flops that simply reduces the confidence in its regulatory direction,” he added.",

    "body": "Rajeev Misra, the trader who helped transform SoftBank into the world’s biggest and most controversial technology investor, is stepping back from the Japanese group to launch a $6bn fund backed by Abu Dhabi.\n\nMisra, who structured and ran the record-breaking $100bn Vision Fund, said he would remain involved with SoftBank but that his new venture would pursue investment strategies beyond start-ups.\n\nThe shake-up marks the latest sign of unrest inside SoftBank, which has been roiled by plunging valuations for technology companies as well as an exodus of senior leadership over the past several months.\n\nThe new fund will be backed by Abu Dhabi state funds Mubadala and ADQ, as well as Royal Group, the conglomerate chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates’ national security adviser, said Misra.\n\nThe support from Abu Dhabi demonstrated Misra’s success in retaining the backing of investors in the region, despite the underwhelming performance of the Vision Fund, which is best known for disastrous bets on office provider WeWork, China’s Didi Chuxing and failed supply chain finance group Greensill Capital.\n\n“We have built a strong relationship with Rajeev and will explore investing in his new fund,” said Mubadala, which was the $100bn Vision Fund’s second-biggest external investor after Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon, who is a brother of the UAE president Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, is also the chair of ADQ, one of Abu Dhabi’s newest and most active investment vehicles.\n\nMisra had spent increasing amounts of time in recent years with Sheikh Tahnoon, one of the UAE’s most powerful figures who also oversees a sprawling business empire, people with knowledge of the matter said. ADQ declined to comment. Royal Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told staff in a memo on Thursday that Misra, a former Deutsche Bank and UBS executive who joined SoftBank in 2014, would leave top roles at the company.\n\nSon said he would personally take on more day-to-day management of SoftBank’s second Vision Fund, which failed to attract external backing and has made troubled bets on start-ups such as Sweden’s Klarna.\n\nSon added Misra would continue to oversee the $100bn Vision Fund and would remain “a trusted senior adviser and integral part of the SoftBank family”.\n\nDuring his eight years at SoftBank, Misra clashed repeatedly with senior colleagues including former Google executive Nikesh Arora, who departed in 2016, and former Sprint chief executive Marcelo Claure, who left earlier this year.\n\nSeveral SoftBank executives, who as with Misra previously worked at Deutsche Bank, are in discussions to join the new venture, according to people familiar with the matter, including Munish Varma, Yanni Pipilis and Akshay Naheta.\n\nNaheta, another divisive figure within SoftBank, presided over the group’s shortlived internal hedge fund SB Northstar, which was effectively shut this year after running up $5.75bn in losses. The 40-year-old left SoftBank in April and is also based in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAt SoftBank, Naheta developed a reputation for engineering controversial trades involving derivatives, such as SoftBank’s intricate $1bn bet on the shares of fraudulent payment company Wirecard.",

    "blurb": "Hedge funds look to expand in a region not laid low by inflation and the war in Ukraine",
    "date": "2022-07-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Global asset managers have their sights set on the Gulf as the oil-rich region emerges as a rare source of spare capital in a market laid low by the war in Ukraine, Covid lockdowns and inflation.\n\nOfficials and executives said the United Arab Emirates was a prime target for money managers seeking to tap this liquidity. Many are looking to base themselves in the financial centres of Dubai and Abu Dhabi as a launch pad for fundraising across the region, where soaring crude prices are delivering huge government surpluses.\n\n“Western funds are coming all summer long, which never happened before,” said Mohammed Afkhami, managing director of Dubai-based Magenta Capital Services, a regional adviser to some of the largest global fund managers. “They are worried about missing the boom.”\n\nSovereign wealth funds in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE are seen as some of the last bastions of available capital, with governments keen to invest their energy riches in global markets.\n\nAccording to Afkhami, institutional investors in the Gulf have increased their allocation to overseas funds by 30 to 50 per cent.\n\nThe region’s sovereign funds are also increasing their investment in private equity, infrastructure and real estate to protect themselves from stock market volatility. Afkhami said Gulf sovereign funds, which oversee $3tn to 4tn in assets, were likely to increase their allocation to private assets from 30 to 40-50 per cent in the coming years.\n\nGlobal asset managers are already expanding in response to this growing demand.\n\nCVC and HPS set up offices in the region last year, while Apollo this year expanded a partnership with Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala, one of the UAE’s largest and most active investors.\n\nHedge funds have also identified the UAE as a good trading location, partly because of low tax rates for staff.\n\nMillennium Management, a US-based hedge fund, is “actively looking to grow” its office of more than 30 people in the Dubai International Financial Centre — the city’s finance hub — said one person with knowledge of its plans.\n\n“The priority is to broaden optionality for new and existing talent,” they said. “This is particularly the case for roles in trading, but also across all areas of the organisation as the firm has responded to the increasing demand for Dubai.”\n\nThe attractions of a UAE base include a timezone that spans Asia and Europe, salaries free of local tax, and that places such as Dubai managed to keep their economy open with relatively low coronavirus rates. Dubai’s new wealthy residents include Asians fleeing lockdowns, cryptocurrency billionaires and remote workers taking advantage of flexible visa schemes.\n\nThe Dubai International Financial Centre was launched in 2004 and is now home to about 30,000 workers. Last month it held a roadshow in New York and San Francisco and had meetings with prospective financial services clients.\n\nAccording to one person with knowledge of the details, other hedge funds that are considering expanding into the UAE include US groups such as Exodus Point, Point72, Verition and UK-based Brevan Howard.\n\nBlueCrest, the former hedge fund that is now a family office, has at least two portfolio managers, one of whom is focused on oil, and an analyst based in Dubai, according to LinkedIn. The fund managers started there last November.\n\nLMR Partners, another UK-based money manager, was incorporated into the DIFC in April. The companies either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnd a year ago, London-based quantitative hedge fund Florin Court Capital opened an office in Abu Dhabi, consisting of trading, operations, research and marketing.\n\n“We needed a more eastern timezone since we do extensive trading in Asian markets,” said founder Doug Greenig, adding this was “a better solution than having people working at 4am out of London”.\n\nGreenig said the Abu Dhabi Investment Office, a government body focused on attracting foreign investment, had provided “financial incentives” to support its plans there.\n\nIn Hong Kong, political unrest, punitive Covid measures and growing Chinese control are causing fund managers to look elsewhere. ARCM, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund, is considering an office in Dubai, one person briefed on the decision said. ARCM did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAbu Dhabi Global Market, the capital’s financial centre, is also fielding strong interest from asset managers in Hong Kong, according to other people briefed on the situation.\n\nDubai officials are also trying to lure UK-based funds that have lost their easy access to EU markets. “With Brexit, they don’t have that advantage, so they can consolidate their operations out of the DIFC,” said one official.\n\nHowever, much asset management business in the UAE consists of marketing and client management, while investment decisions are made and executed in the financial hubs of New York and London.\n\nUAE officials are working on a scheme to persuade fund managers to build larger on-the-ground operations and move more staff to the region.\n\n“It’s all very well to come here to raise money, but what the Middle East now wants is for asset managers to build real operations here, with decision makers based here conducting real investments into the real economy,” said one official.\n\nSome also warn of parallels with 2008, when the Gulf region was initially unaffected by the global financial crisis.\n\n“We do live in a global interdependent world, and as we saw in 2008, the economic decoupling was relatively shortlived,” said May Nasrallah, founder of deNovo Corporate Advisors. The region was unable to avoid an economic slowdown, debt overhang and eventual restructurings in the wake of the global crisis.\n\nShe said the Gulf was now better placed to avoid economic shocks, with less external exposure and lower debt levels. “However, as we continue to live in a global interrelated economy, we will eventually be impacted by the contraction, stagflation and predicted recession in Europe and the US.”\n\nThis article has been updated to change Millennium Capital to Millennium Management.",

    "date": "2022-06-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "The US has called on financial institutions in the United Arab Emirates to remain vigilant in combating Russian sanctions evasion as western states fret that their Gulf ally, and others such as Turkey, could emerge as havens for illicit cash linked to the Kremlin.\n\nWally Adeyemo, deputy treasury secretary, welcomed UAE institutions’ commitment to preventing money laundering, but said the Gulf state — like other global financial hubs — faces the “threat of illicit financial flows”. He underscored the need “for vigilance and proactive action” in combating Russian sanctions evasion, including in the UAE.\n\n“We know that Russian banks have employed deceptive payment practices and used shell companies and other means to hide the true nature of their transactions,” according to a copy of his prepared address to a UAE banking roundtable released on Wednesday.\n\n“Financial institutions must be exceedingly cautious in handling any Russia-related businesses and in managing the risks associated with financial institutions that have exposure to the Russian financial system,” he added.\n\nHundreds of Russians and companies have been sanctioned by around 30 jurisdictions, including the US, since the invasion of Ukraine in February. UAE officials have told their western counterparts that sanctioned Russian individuals and entities will not be able to do business in the country.\n\nWestern officials have recognised UAE banks’ rigour in dealing with the inflow of tens of thousands of Russians into the Gulf’s commercial hub since the invasion. Many global lenders based in the UAE are aware of the danger, having previously been fined for transactions with neighbouring Iran, which has been under sanctions for years.\n\nPeople involved in setting up businesses and securing visas for new Russian residents say due diligence on their clients can lead to delays and problems in opening accounts and transferring money, but that many, especially the very wealthy, have nonetheless managed to move cash to the UAE and buy properties.\n\nAdeyemo, who arrived in the UAE earlier this week, warned that insufficient due diligence “is not a defence” and the US could target non-US citizens for providing “material support” to a sanctioned entity.\n\nDiplomats have been concerned about the visible presence of yachts and private jets belonging to sanctioned Russians in the UAE, fearing that one of their closest regional security partners could undermine US and European attempts to constrain president Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Madame Gu superyacht, owned by Russian parliamentarian Andrei Skoch who is under sanctions, was recently observed berthed at Dubai’s Port Rashid terminal. Andrey Melnichenko’s Motor Yacht A has been moored in Ras Al Khaimah for months. The coal and fertiliser magnate has been sanctioned by jurisdictions including the UK and EU.\n\nOn Wednesday, Adeyemo arrived in Turkey, where he was due to meet government officials as well as members of the banking and finance community in Ankara and Istanbul.\n\nTurkey, a Nato member, has opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has supplied armed drones to Kyiv. But it has also been eager not to damage its close energy, trade and tourism ties with Russia, and has declined to sign up to western sanctions against Moscow.\n\nA US official said that Adeyemo would use his meetings with Turkish officials to discuss “regional economic issues, combating terrorist financing, and co-ordination on the implementation of unprecedented multilateral sanctions on Russia for its war against Ukraine”.\n\n",

    "blurb": "Fund set to gain exposure to flagship port in return for generous outlay that will cut logistics group’s debt ",
    "date": "2022-06-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Maintaining a special relationship requires deals to benefit both sides. State-controlled DP World and Canadian pension fund CDPQ have co-invested in ports across the world for the past seven years. Now the Montreal-based fund is paying $5bn for a 22 per cent stake in its flagship Jebel Ali port and associated assets. It gains exposure to one of the world’s busiest ports in return for a generous outlay that will reduce DP World’s debt pile.\n\nDP World took on $8.1bn of extra borrowings when it went private in 2020. The deal with CDPQ — and DP World’s mooted sale of another 13 per cent slug of the assets for $3bn — should help it meet its stated goal of getting net debt from 6.9 times, as calculated by Moody’s, to below four times ebitda this calendar year.\n\nIts strong free cash flow — $2.1bn last year — is partly earmarked for capital spending, estimated by Fitch to amount to about $1.5bn a year. The UK, where it has already invested about £2bn, is a potential beneficiary. That might explain the UK government’s limited response — beyond expressions of outrage — to the summary dismissal of 800 sailors of its P&O Ferries business without consultation in March.\n\nCDPQ’s $5bn deal, financed equally with equity and debt, puts a $23bn enterprise value on the port, which is the Middle East’s biggest, and on two industrial zones. That implies an EV-to-ebitda multiple of about 18 times. Though at least a third higher than the industry average, it is not exceptional. In 2015 a consortium of Hermes and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board reportedly paid 24 times ebitda for a minority stake in Associated British Ports.\n\nThere are potential hazards. The port is exposed to geopolitical risks, specifically Iran. The deteriorating economic outlook is taking a toll. Growth in the volume of goods handled by DP World slowed to 1.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2022. But the Jebel Ali port has demonstrated pricing power. Assuming it can continue to pass on inflationary increases, the deal should be a solid performer for the Canadian fund.",

    "blurb": "The trophy real-estate project was mothballed in the financial crisis. Now a Maldives-style Anantara resort aims to put the islands back on the map",
    "date": "2022-06-0300:00:00.0",
    "body": "In a Dubai courtroom 11 years ago, a lawyer representing Nakheel, the state-run developer, faced accusations that its most ostentatious project was “dead”. Subsequent newspaper headlines gleefully warned: “Dubai fears end of The World”.\n\nThe collection of 300 man-made islands off the Gulf coast, arranged to resemble a world map and surrounded by a 27km breakwater, was announced in 2003 and intended to be the ultimate trophy real-estate project. Soon sand was being dredged, the islands began to appear and a bidding frenzy ensued; in a 2006 publicity stunt Richard Branson posed on the island representing Britain wearing a Union Jack suit.\n\nBut then came the global financial crisis, bringing the ambitious emirate into recession. Legal wrangles consumed the city. Work on the World Islands stopped but the Nakheel lawyer insisted the project wasn’t dead, only merely like a patient in a “coma” — implying that it would, in time, wake up and be successful.\n\nNow, a decade on, that seemingly optimistic appraisal is closer to coming true. In line with Dubai’s rollercoaster history, the city’s services-and tourism-oriented economy is back on the way up, buoyed first by an influx of wealthy people thanks to the United Arab Emirates’ successful handling of the pandemic and, more recently, a flood of rich Russians seeking a financial haven. In December, the artificial archipelago got its first hotel: a five-star resort operated by Anantara that sits on the island representing Argentina and offers 70 beachfront villas with panoramic views of Dubai’s skyscraper-strewn skyline.\n\nThere is a fitting circularity in the fact this first hotel is owned by the man who launched the World Islands, Sultan bin Sulayem, Nakheel’s former chief executive and a confidante of Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.\n\n“I had always envisaged the islands as a mirror of the Maldives,” he told me as he strolled around the island in flip flops. “I was determined to make this dream come to life.”\n\nIn 2008, bin Sulayem’s family firm bought 10 islands in the area of the archipelago representing South America. During Dubai’s debt crisis, he was moved on from Nakheel and refocused on the company that had made his name: Dubai Ports World. The logistics powerhouse has gone on to become one of the world’s largest ports operators, though its P&O Ferries unit sparked fury when it sacked 800 British seafarers in March.\n\nAs a sideline to his day job as chief executive of DP World, bin Sulayem and his children started developing the resort in 2014, as well as building a personal family home there. Anantara came on board as the operator, bringing its own style garnered from years of operations across five resorts in the Maldives. Banks declined to fund his development — so the entire cost has been funded by bin Sulayem personally. “In the next few months, once we have a track record of operations, the banks should be more comfortable to fund the next phases,” he said.\n\nFrom a jetty on the Palm Jumeirah, a 15-minute transfer via speedboat provides views of Dubai landmarks such as the self-styled “seven-star” Burj Al Arab hotel. As the boat enters through the World’s oval breakwater, the Anantara resort comes into view, its circumference marked out by a thousand coconut trees imported from Oman. Staff clap arriving guests in a ceremony aping traditions in the Maldives. Peacocks root among young plants dotted around the beachfront.\n\nInfluencer-friendly features, such as a heart-shaped rock sculpture framing Dubai’s distant skyline and swings that are submerged by the rising tide, will no doubt fill Instagram timelines for years to come.\n\nThe skyscrapers of Dubai might be visible but the sense of isolation will be a comfort for grizzled residents of the metropolis, where hotel experiences often revolve around packed beaches and boozy brunches. “This is a place for those who will enjoy the Maldivian feel of an island resort but know that they still have all the attractions of Dubai on offer nearby,” said James Hewitson, the hotel’s general manager.\n\nIt takes a gentle 30-minute walk to circumnavigate the island and, while most of the World remains unbuilt on, a handful of other developments are visible. There are the lush surroundings of “Greenland”, where Sheikh Mohammed has a villa, and apartment blocks and Viking longship-themed palaces on “The Heart of Europe”, a residential and hospitality complex over six islands.\n\nThe developments have alarmed conservationists worried about the impact on the marine environment, including the destruction of coral reefs and the silting of the once-aquamarine waters of the Gulf. Moreover, the toll from construction and maintenance of properties on these isolated islands raises questions over their sustainability.\n\n“Dredging up sand to reclaim beaches and artificial islands is a never-ending process,” says Jim Krane, a fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute. “Water currents, winds and rising sea levels are all working at cross purposes to Dubai’s central planners. Without constant attention, the World would slip under the waves.”\n\nCut off from the mainland power grid, the Anantara resort relies on a generator to power the island. “Everything that’s consumed [on the World] gets shipped in,” says Krane, author of Dubai: The Story of the World’s Fastest City. “All of this extra work adds to the cost and increases the carbon footprint — in a place that’s already at the bottom of the class in carbon emissions.”\n\nTo mitigate the resort’s environmental impact, bin Sulayem has hired a sustainability adviser to seek out efficiencies. There are plans to install more solar panels; sewage is treated on site; drinking water is produced on the island and delivered in reusable bottles.\n\nIts maritime location is several degrees cooler than the mainland — a key attraction during the soaring heat and humidity of the Gulf summer, when temperatures can top 50C. The hotel management expects strong demand from staycations and regional visitors from the neighbouring Gulf states.\n\nFor the most part, the operation is already well-oiled. Staff are attentive but give guests some privacy, communicating via WhatsApp rather than intrusive phone calls. A Mediterranean-themed restaurant provides a buffet breakfast and all-day eating. Qamar, the fine-dining outlet, boasts a porch overlooking the sea, where they serve Arabic and Indian food, including some of the finest naan in Dubai.\n\nIt may be an ersatz Maldivian experience, but the resort nonetheless offers a unique escape for Dubai residents and a new vista for the emirate’s visitors.\n\nSimeon Kerr is the FT’s Gulf business correspondent\n\nFollow @ftweekend on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first",

    "blurb": "Pact builds on growing economic links since establishment of diplomatic ties in 2020",
    "date": "2022-05-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has become the first Arab state to sign a full free trade deal with Israel, building on economic links that have grown since the two states established diplomatic ties in 2020.\n\nThe economy ministers of both states signed in Dubai on Tuesday the comprehensive economic partnership agreement, which aims to advance bilateral trade to more than $10bn within five years. From September 2020 to March 2022, non-oil trade exceeded $2.5bn. The deal will add $1.9bn to the UAE’s economy over the same timeframe, the UAE said in a statement on the official news agency.\n\nThe deal eliminates or reduces 96 per cent of tariffs on goods and services, creating opportunities in sectors such as energy, the environment and digital trade, the statement said.\n\nThe pact “with Israel will create a new paradigm for the region,” said Abdulla bin Touq, the UAE’s economy minister. “It will accelerate growth and underscores a shared belief that the only way to build resilient and sustainable economies in a complex world is by doing so together.”\n\nThe pact is the fastest free trade agreement to be signed in Israeli history, prime minister Naftali Bennett said in a tweet, describing it as the first of its scope to be signed between his country and an Arab nation.\n\nTrade, tourism and investment have flourished since the signing of the so-called Abraham Accords during the Trump administration, which also included Bahrain and later Sudan and Morocco. Bilateral trade reached $1.06bn in the first quarter of this year, five times the previous-year period.\n\nThe UAE, alarmed at a perceived disengagement of the US from the Middle East, has been developing other allies to diversify its security arrangements. Rocket and drone attacks launched by Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen against the capital Abu Dhabi in January brought into sharp relief the UAE’s vulnerability.\n\nLike neighbouring Gulf powerhouse Saudi Arabia, which has covert relations but no formal ties with Israel, the UAE shares common concerns with the Jewish state around Iran’s nuclear programme and interference in the Arab world.\n\nLong before the normalisation of ties, the UAE was engaged covertly with Israel on economic and security co-operation, including Emirati investment into Israeli technology firms.\n\nDorian Barak, co-founder of the UAE-Israel Business Council, a trade promotion body, said UAE-Israel trade was already on track to exceed $2bn this year. “Dubai is fast becoming a hub for Israeli companies that look to south Asia, the Middle East and the Far East as markets for their goods and services,” he said in a statement. He added that almost 1,000 Israeli companies would be working in and through the UAE by the end of this year. “It’s unprecedented,” he said.\n\nSince normalisation, there has been a number of government-to-government deals, including co-operation over military drone technology and a plan to build solar energy and water desalination plants on either side of the Jordan river.\n\nIn the private sector, Israeli venture capital platform OurCrowd has opened an office in Abu Dhabi, where it is finalising plans for an artificial-intelligence research and development facility. “Given global supply chain shocks, this [the deal] could redraw global supply chains with the UAE-Israel link as a key component,” said Sabah al-Binali, executive chairman of OurCrowd Arabia.\n\nThe new-found partnership has endured periods of political tensions and violence between Israel and the Palestinians, such as last year’s Gaza war and the recent killing of Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh during an Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nLet’s hope UAE-Israel pact has regional domino effect / From Anil Trigunayat, Former Indian Ambassador to Jordan (2014-16) and Libya (2012-14), Gurgaon, Haryana, India",

    "blurb": "Boat’s presence in Ras al-Khaimah is a reminder of the Gulf state’s ambivalence towards western sanctions on Moscow",
    "date": "2022-05-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Investigators around the world have been searching for sanctions-hit Russian oligarchs’ yachts. One has been hiding in plain sight.\n\nItalian authorities in March impounded Russian coal and fertilisers magnate Andrey Melnichenko’s $600mn Sailing Yacht A after Russia invaded Ukraine. Another yacht, the $300mn Philippe Starck-designed Motor Yacht A, has been anchored for weeks in the port of Ras al-Khaimah, in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBy placing his yacht in the UAE, Melnichenko has put it beyond the reach of western governments enforcing sanctions on those deemed supportive of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine.\n\nIts presence is a symbolic reminder of the Gulf monarchy’s ambivalence towards western sanctions on Russia, allies of Putin and the wealthy businessmen who have often benefited from ties to the state.\n\nWhile the UAE government is trying to enhance measures against money laundering to exit a global dirty-money watchdog’s watchlist, the economic foundation of cities such as Dubai has long been based on welcoming flows of assets and people.\n\n“Given its non-enforcement of western sanctions, the dilemma for the UAE is how to sustain its place as an open destination for capital while also appearing to be a good global citizen,” said one compliance professional. “It’s a tricky balancing act.”\n\nThe government of the Isle of Man said it had in March deregistered Melnichenko’s yachts, including Motor Yacht A, because of western sanctions, saying, “we will continue to act with appropriate robustness should the situation warrant it”.\n\nMarine locator services placed Motor Yacht A off the Maldives in March. The Financial Times then saw the yacht on April 18. On Saturday it remained moored opposite Ras al-Khaimah’s city-centre fish market.\n\nBusinessmen in the UAE say Melnichenko, who denies affiliations to the Kremlin, held meetings there in April, but the tycoon has since returned to Moscow. A representative of Melnichenko, who has been placed under sanctions by the EU and UK as well as Switzerland and Australia, referred questions on the yacht to a lawyer who declined to comment.\n\nUAE authorities in Dubai, Ras al-Khaimah and Abu Dhabi declined to comment.\n\nEuropean officials say they have raised concerns with Emirati counterparts that the UAE could become a financial haven for Russians placed under western sanctions. “We don’t want our allies to become facilitators for the Putin regime,” said one.\n\nThe UAE government has said it is maintaining a neutral course through the war, calling for an end to hostilities and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Abu Dhabi, which has developed closer ties with Moscow in recent years, has also assured its allies that sanctions-hit entities will not be able to operate in the UAE. The Gulf monarchy, which has long argued that it is not compelled to enforce other nations’ sanctions, is keen to maintain its historical role as an apolitical territory focused on business.\n\nThousands of wealthy, non-sanctions-hit Russians have relocated to the UAE to escape economic uncertainty and political instability at home, even though they sometimes struggle to access the financial system. “Big banks are more cautious but smaller banks are offering help to those wishing to relocate. It’s just taking a lot of time,” said a Russian businessman.\n\nVery wealthy Russians generally find financial institutions accommodating. Most of the wealthy elite have second passports from countries that sell nationality, such as Malta or Portugal, which facilitates the opening of new accounts with lenders that are warier of Russian passport holders.\n\nOthers have turned to alternative routes, such as cryptocurrencies and hawala, or informal money exchange services. The cost of this service has risen from 1 per cent of the transaction value to 5 per cent since the war broke out as demand surges, said one person aware of the trades.\n\nMany in the UAE see a hypocrisy in western concern over the presence of the yacht and the Russians building new lives there. “So it was OK for London to take all the oligarch money but not for Dubai?” asked one lawyer.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nastassia Astrasheuskaya in Riga",

    "body": "The first special purpose acquisition company to be listed in the Middle East closed higher on its first day of trading in Abu Dhabi on Friday.\n\nADC Acquisition Corporation, backed by the oil-rich emirate’s government, is the latest in a string of blank-cheque companies from the region as liquidity surges thanks to sky-high oil prices, and domestic capital markets are busy with initial public offerings of stakes in government-linked firms.\n\nThe spate of IPOs is attracting money from outside the region, with global managers looking to take advantage of the higher-growth environment and also tap the region’s sovereign funds for investment.\n\n“Ultimately, we aim to enhance the business environment in Abu Dhabi and contribute to establishing the UAE’s capital as a leading hub for private companies seeking to go public,” said Mohamed Alsuwaidi, chair of ADC and chief executive of ADQ, an Abu Dhabi state holding company that is co-sponsor of the Spac.\n\nADC, which raised about $100mn in the listing, said it would seek a target company with “their main operations in the UAE and across the Middle East and north Africa”.\n\nADC was established by ADQ and Chimera Investment, a unit of the private Royal Group, which is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE’s powerful national security adviser. Sheikh Tahnoon also chairs ADQ.\n\nAlthough Spacs have struggled to achieve their promise and fallen out of fashion in other markets, a number of businesses in the Middle East are considering the option.\n\nBahrain-based Investcorp is working on a plan to list a regional Spac raising as much as $250mn in the UAE, people with knowledge of the plans said. This listing, potentially in Dubai, would be the global asset manager’s third Spac in a year, following two listings in the US that are searching for targets in Europe and India, respectively.\n\nGulf Capital, a UAE-based private equity firm, is also eyeing a Spac listing of about $150mn in Abu Dhabi, a person briefed on the details said.\n\nShuaa Capital, a Dubai-listed investment bank, in March listed a $100mn Spac on Nasdaq, seeking a merger with a technology or fintech company in the Middle East. Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, raised a $200mn Spac last year.\n\nAs oil prices have soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the pace of IPOs has picked up, most recently with the listing of a stake in Borouge, a plastics producer owned by Abu Dhabi’s national oil company and Austria’s Borealis.\n\n“Our pipeline of new listings and IPOs remains robust,” said Saeed Al Dhaheri, chief executive of Abu Dhabi’s stock exchange.",

    "blurb": "In spite of lingering lockdown effects and the threat of a global recession, executives were upbeat about the sector’s prospects at the FT’s recent summit",
    "date": "2022-05-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "“The new Hong Kong is Dubai. And next will be Saudi Arabia,” Gildo Zegna, chief executive of Italian luxury group Zegna, observed to FT editor Roula Khalaf on stage at last week’s Financial Times Business of Luxury Summit.\n\nZegna, which listed on the NYSE combining with a US special purpose acquisition company in December, and owns both the Zegna brand and Thom Browne, is one of several luxury companies seeing a flurry of spending in the region thanks to rising oil prices, strong economic growth and a return to shopping locally. For example at Richemont, sales in the Middle East and Africa for the year ending March 31 increased 53 per cent from the previous year to €1.4bn; meaning the region has surpassed Japan as the group’s fourth-largest market.\n\nThough only a small part of luxury brands’ overall revenues, the region is one of the “glimmers of hope” in an otherwise extremely challenging economic environment, said Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, speaking on a panel moderated by the FT’s chief economics commentator Martin Wolf. “It is the only place you can point to that they are doing better than before.”\n\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council countries, which include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are set to see a 6.1 per cent increase in gross domestic product in 2022, according to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.\n\nSarah Willersdorf, global head of luxury at Boston Consulting Group, said she has seen “considerable growth and investing” in the region. That’s in response not only to an uptick in spending, but also a change in retail investment policy in the UAE, including the shopping hub of Dubai and the wealthy capital Abu Dhabi, which has allowed foreigners to establish companies with full, rather than minority, ownership, spurring some brands to take direct control of their stores and operations.\n\nDubai is attracting not only local customers but also tourists who might have previously bought their handbags or suits in London or Paris. On a given day, customers from as many as 30 different countries shop at the company’s store in a mall in Dubai, Zegna said. “It never happened in Hong Kong.”\n\nThe outlook for luxury’s two most important markets — the US and China — is looking less rosy. Citi analysts recently cut GDP growth forecasts for both the US and China, but Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods equity research at Citi, believes the effects will be short-term.\n\nHe expects disruptions to Chinese demand will last until the third quarter, partly because of supply chain issues weighing on recovery, but “the fundamentals are extremely strong for this market.”\n\nIn spite of rising inflation in the US, credit card spending has remained at 2019 levels in recent months, according to Chauvet. “In the US brands have done a lot to improve the quality of distribution, the quality of the offering, taking control over pricing and having bigger penetration online, so I think that [the market] will be pretty solid after a bit of a slowdown,” he said.\n\nZegna and Antoine Arnault, chief executive of the Berluti business of LVMH as well as the luxury conglomerate’s head of communication, image and environment, were similarly confident the US luxury boom would continue, and that spending in China would recover as lockdown restrictions eased in Shanghai. “We don’t look at our business there quarter to quarter, we look at a five years from and we are very optimistic,” said Arnault.\n\nNot everyone believes the Chinese market will bounce back as quickly as it did when lockdown restrictions were lifted in the spring of 2020. “The impact this time is bigger and we expect recovery to take longer,” said Veronique Yang, managing director at BCG China.\n\nSustainability was also top of mind for speakers at last week’s summit. Valentino chair Rachid Mohamed Rachid said sustainability is “very, very high in the agenda” at the Italian brand.\n\nRaw materials — from fur to leather to cotton — have a disproportionate impact on fashion labels’ environmental footprints and have become a key area of investment and research for those who want to meet their sustainability targets.\n\n“Two-thirds of a brand’s environmental footprint is attributable to the choice of materials,” said Federica Marchionni, chief executive of Global Fashion Agenda, a non-profit organisation that pushes the industry to improve its sustainability performance.\n\nMost luxury brands and conglomerates have stepped away from fur, which for most represents a negligible percentage of sales, but almost all have remained loyal to leather, which is responsible for about half of sales at Kering, Hermès and Prada. While Marchionni is optimistic about leather going the way of fur in the long term, many bio-based alternatives still struggle with quality and scale.\n\n“The fundamental challenge to scale is the performance and quality of the material,” said Matthew Scullin, chief executive of MycoWorks, whose fine mycelium leather alternative has been used by Hermès.\n\nLVMH has continued to use fur, namely at Fendi, and Arnault said the conglomerate doesn’t plan to phase it out until the company has an alternative that makes consumers feel that “they have the same value in their hands”. To this end, in April LVMH launched a two-year research programme with Fendi, Imperial College London and Central Saint Martins to develop new lab-grown fur fibres for luxury fashion.\n\nCovid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns in China, the cost of living crisis in Europe and rising interest rates in the US are making the prospect of a global recession all too real, but luxury, undeterred, keeps ploughing ahead.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow @financialtimesfashion on Instagram",

    "blurb": "Gulf state buzzes with talk that new president could choose son as heir apparent",
    "date": "2022-05-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "As world leaders descended on the United Arab Emirates this week to offer condolences on the death of ruler Sheikh Khalifa, diplomatic circles buzzed with speculation over whether his successor Sheikh Mohammed, known as MBZ, would break with tradition and pick his son, rather than one of his brothers, as crown prince.\n\nThe nomination of a crown prince or heir apparent is used to signal stability in Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich emirate that leads the Gulf monarchy, whose ruler wields power in consultation with his siblings and other powerful clans. The UAE plays an increasingly important role across the Middle East.\n\nThe UAE’s founder, Sheikh Zayed — the father of Sheikh Khalifa and Mohammed and other influential officials — had two decades ago indicated that succession should pass through his sons but many anticipate that the powerful Sheikh Mohammed, 61, will instead choose his eldest son, Sheikh Khaled.\n\n“There are obviously concerns that MBZ wants to establish his own dynasty by selecting Khaled. It would be a massive departure from the traditional power dynamics in the UAE,” said Cinzia Bianco, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “MBZ is already doing centralisation — this would be hyper-centralisation.”\n\nSheikh Mohammed’s 18 years as heir apparent transformed Abu Dhabi, from restructuring local government operations to launching diversification programmes to prepare for a post-oil era. He cracked down on domestic dissent and intervened in regional conflicts from Libya to Yemen to prevent political Islam consolidating gains after the Arab spring.\n\nHis control deepened after Sheikh Khalifa suffered a stroke in 2014 and retired from public life. Since then, the ruling family has overseen dramatic domestic reforms seeking to secularise society and torn up the regional rule book by normalising diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nMBZ’s relative young age would make his sons a more likely choice than his brothers. “MBZ could reasonably expect to be an active leader for at least another two decades, barring ill health or anything unexpected, so my instinct is that he would want to name one of his sons as his crown prince,” said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nEducated in the US, Sheikh Khaled, 40, started his formal government career within the security services, graduating to domestic policy in recent years, including oversight of a powerful Abu Dhabi executive agency. His profile has risen in recent years as he took on more senior government roles.\n\nIf Sheikh Mohammed elects to follow familial tradition and put forward one of his brothers, the most obvious candidate is Sheikh Tahnoon, the experienced national security adviser, analysts say.\n\nHe has played a pivotal role in the country’s regional interventions over the past decade, including military operations in Yemen and Libya, while also building close relations with the security services of western allies and handling delicate diplomacy with rivals, including Iran and Turkey.\n\nSheikh Tahnoon oversees pillars of Abu Dhabi’s economy, including a state holding company, ADQ, and the country’s largest bank, FAB. He also has sprawling private business interests, including the IHC conglomerate, which has grown from a fish farming firm into one of Abu Dhabi’s largest companies with a flurry of takeovers.\n\nAnother brother, Sheikh Mansour, deputy prime minister and owner of Manchester City football club, is also renowned for his extensive commercial interests, but has been associated with financial scandal, most notably the 1MDB fraud. Other brothers in the frame include Sheikh Hazza, who was tipped as a future crown prince a decade ago.\n\nThere is no procedure for the selection of a crown prince. Sheikh Zayed appointed Khalifa as crown prince a few years after his ascent in 1966 and before his death named MBZ as deputy crown prince. But some local observers are convinced that, for the sake of stable government, the announcement could be made after the 40-day mourning period.\n\nChristopher Davidson, associate fellow at the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said MBZ’s strength means he has the freedom to act “tomorrow or next year”, but that he may well allow “the dust to settle”, providing some time for his son’s image to be cemented in the media.\n\nMBZ could also take a leaf out of his father’s playbook, nominating a brother as crown prince and his son as deputy crown prince, or a similar balancing act to give Khaled more time to grow into the role.\n\n“They are considering a few options — one is to have a de jure and a de facto crown prince,” said Bianco. “It’s gaining traction because there is absolutely not a consensus candidate.”",

    "blurb": "Powerful younger brother Sheikh Mohammed set to become next leader of oil-rich Gulf state",
    "date": "2022-05-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates’ president and ruler of oil-rich Abu Dhabi since 2004, has died aged 73, with his powerful brother set to become the Gulf state’s next leader.\n\nSheikh Khalifa, who presided over the UAE’s rapid economic transformation, had retired from public life after suffering a stroke in 2014. He had handed over decision-making to his half-brother, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi’s powerful crown prince. Sheikh Mohammed is poised to become the next president.\n\n“The UAE has lost its righteous son and leader of the ‘empowerment phase’ and guardian of its blessed journey,” Sheikh Mohammed said on Twitter.\n\nThe son of the UAE’s founding president Sheikh Zayed, Sheikh Khalifa was “known for his modest style and generous, decent nature”, said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political-science professor. “And thanks to his capable crown prince, the country was not at a loss when he had to step back with illness. The de facto leader now becomes the de jure leader.”\n\nSheikh Mohammed’s complete control over political and economic affairs removes any questions about policy direction during the succession period. Under Sheikh Mohammed’s leadership, the UAE has become a more prominent geopolitical player in the Middle East, intervening in an effort to check the rise of Islamism and plug a perceived gap in US commitment to the Middle East. The Gulf monarchy has also become a leading global investor while building domestic industry and financial services as it seeks to diversify away from hydrocarbons.\n\nHis ascent to the positions of ruler of Abu Dhabi and then president of the UAE creates an opening for a new crown prince. It is unclear whether he will follow tradition and choose a brother or, as many believe, pick his eldest son for the role.\n\nThe UAE gained independence from the UK in 1971. In its early days as a sovereign state, Sheikh Khalifa was put in charge of Abu Dhabi’s development. His eponymous committee granted loans to nationals who wanted to build towers for the growing number of businesses and expatriates seeking to capitalise on the oil boom.\n\nThe move helped broaden wealth across key families in the emirate, whose nationals are now some of the world’s richest. The legacy of this period is visible in downtown Abu Dhabi, developed as a Manhattan-style matrix of streets lined with skyscrapers.\n\nIn the 1990s, as his father’s health declined, Sheikh Khalifa acted as effective president. During that period, the energetic Sheikh Mohammed emerged with his five full brothers as the leading force within the government. The grouping includes national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon, Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour and the foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah.\n\nWhen Sheikh Khalifa took over from his father, Abu Dhabi launched a large investment and real estate development programme led by his brother that transformed the capital as it sought to match the global ambitions of neighbouring Dubai. Over time, Sheikh Mohammed became the go-to man for diplomats and business figures.\n\nObservers said Sheikh Khalifa was happy to cede this outward-facing role to his more engaging and forceful brother. But Sheikh Khalifa still acted as a restraint on Sheikh Mohammed’s growing autonomy. Wary of Abu Dhabi’s sudden breakneck development, Sheikh Khalifa retained the final say on oil policy and public spending.\n\nWhen the UAE’s second emirate of Dubai teetered on the verge of bankruptcy after the real estate crash of 2008, the city-state only avoided a sovereign default by requesting bailout loans of more than $20bn underwritten by the capital.\n\nMohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Dubai’s ruler, renamed the world’s tallest tower from Burj Dubai to Burj Khalifa on its opening in 2010. The tribute was interpreted as a recognition of Sheikh Khalifa’s help for Dubai in its hour of need.\n\nThe ministry of presidential affairs has announced a 40-day mourning period, with flags raised at half-mast and three days’ closure for government entities and the private sector.",

    "blurb": "Rare and illegal strike by Talabat food delivery drivers comes as oil and food prices rocket",
    "date": "2022-05-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "On any normal weekday, Dubai’s food delivery riders would be up and out early, but in recent days, banks of motorbikes have been parked outside their budget dormitories. “They are all sleeping,” said one doorman in Bur Dubai, the central district where many cram into apartments.\n\nFood delivery riders for Talabat, a unit of Germany’s Delivery Hero, have gone on an illegal strike to protest over their low wages as the rising cost of living sparks widening unrest among the poorest workers in the Gulf entrepôt, a playground for some of the world’s richest people.\n\nThe rare outbreak of industrial unrest in the Gulf state comes as fuel prices have soared since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This has slashed the take-home pay of riders, who purchase their own petrol. With inflation hitting other products such as food, living standards are declining for workers who eke out a living on slim salaries.\n\n“The salaries are too low and petrol is too high. This is a problem — everyone stopped work,” said one rider at Talabat, who did not want his name to be published. Last year he “made Dh2,500 ($681), now it is Dh1,500 [a month].”\n\nThe Talabat walkout, which has hobbled the app’s service in the country, comes after a strike this month in Dubai by employees of rival operator Deliveroo prompted the UK-based firm to drop plans to cut salaries and extend working hours.\n\nTalabat riders have called for an increase in their basic pay from Dh7.50 per food order to Dh8 or Dh9. The company said it was open to discussions “through the right channels, and in a constructive way”.\n\nTalabat, which uses 20,000 riders nationwide, said riders had gross average earnings of about Dh3,500 a month, with about 70 per cent of riders up until last week expressing satisfaction with their pay. “Yet, we understand economic and political realities are changing constantly, and we will always continue to listen to what riders have to say,” it said in a statement.\n\nStrike action and unionised labour are outlawed in the UAE, where the authorities are quick to snuff out any display of dissent, whether related to politics or economic conditions. From construction to retail, migrant workers form the backbone of Gulf economies, most of whom travel from south Asia with the aim of remitting funds back to their families.\n\n“To strike in the UAE things have to be desperate, so this is a sign of how difficult things have got for delivery drivers with recent fuel cost rises,” said James Lynch, a founding director of FairSquare, a human rights research group.\n\nOne rider, who pays Dh300 a month for a bedspace in a room shared with 11 others, said desperation over the cost of living crisis overshadowed their concerns about potentially breaking the law. “We aren’t blocking the roads,” he said. “We are just staying home.”\n\nOver the years construction workers have staged intermittent strike action and taxi drivers have also been known to stop work in protest at conditions. Dubai police riot squads have broken up or threatened such protests and the leaders of strike action have previously been deported.\n\nThe labour protest comes as broader economic activity in the UAE surges, thanks to an influx of new residents since the pandemic started, the entry of wealthy Russians since the Ukraine war broke out and sky-high oil prices that have boosted the Gulf’s hydrocarbon-dependent economies. This new demographic of high rollers, including rich expatriates and cryptocurrency billionaires, has supported the market for property, luxury retailers and high-end restaurants across the city.\n\nBut the blue-collar majority of Dubai’s 3.5mn population are struggling. Long queues have appeared outside petrol stations on the eve of government price rises, which are set every month in line with global prices. Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, forecasts inflation rising to 3.9 per cent this year from a forecast 0 per cent in 2021.\n\nWhile subsidies on utilities and food have helped limit the impact, “the sharply higher energy prices are feeding through and impacting household spending patterns,” she said. Previously low inflation before the pandemic means price rises are now more keenly felt. Petrol, for example, has risen 87 per cent since 2017 while the price of milk is up 50 per cent over the same period.\n\nMany riders, not just those at Talabat, say that the decline in their take-home pay is a blow to their families in south Asia who depend on their remittances and also face rampant inflation.\n\n“Our work is too dangerous and hard — I can’t walk at the end of my 14-hour shifts,” said Mohammed, a striking Talabat rider on Thursday. “But God decides when I die and will provide.”",

    "body": "A Yorkshire gold dealership at the centre of an alleged £266mn money laundering operation used illegally acquired cash deposited in its NatWest bank account to buy the precious metal, which was then shipped to Dubai and out of the reach of the UK authorities, a criminal trial has been told.\n\nA jury at Leeds Crown Court, which is hearing one of Britain’s biggest money laundering prosecutions, was told that the cash had to be paid through Bradford-based Fowler Oldfield “to hide its true origins and give it a veneer of respectability” as part of  a “very sophisticated money laundering system”.\n\nFowler Oldfield deposited up to £1mn pounds of cash on some days into its NatWest account between January 2014 and September 2016, prosecutors allege.\n\nCash was taken to Fowler Oldfield’s Yorkshire premises by couriers from Glasgow and Merseyside, who used plastic carrier bags and sports holdalls containing hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash which prosecutors claim came from criminal activity.\n\nSome couriers arrived with cash hidden in the door panels of cars, in black bin liners or hidden in takeaway food boxes, the trial heard. One courier used two toy boxes wrapped as birthday presents to hide cash.\n\n“Legitimate business people do not bring cash in sports bags, hidden in the panels of vehicles,” Nicholas Clarke QC, prosecuting, said.\n\nMoney was credited from Fowler Oldfield’s NatWest bank account to two Birmingham gold suppliers so the dealership could buy gold — which was then exported to Dubai, prosecutors have alleged. A further £46mn was transferred to an account in the name of Stunt & Co Ltd,  a company owned by James Stunt, the former husband of socialite Petra Ecclestone, the trial heard.\n\nStunt is one of eight individuals who are standing trial on one count of money laundering. All the defendants, who also include five individuals linked to Fowler Oldfield, deny wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutors claimed in the trial on Wednesday that there were close links between Fowler Oldfield and Stunt & Co. Gregory Frankel, a Fowler Oldfield director, who is also a defendant in the trial, became a vice-president of Stunt & Co. Frankel also received free accommodation in a London flat and use of a Lamborghini supplied by Stunt, the trial heard.\n\nAnother defendant, Francesca Sota, Stunt’s then personal assistant, paid in £313,000 in cash into Fowler Oldfield’s bank account at a central London bank branch on  March 3 2016, the jury was told.\n\nClarke claimed to the trial that Stunt, although he was living in the US at the time and did not get involved in the buying of gold, took a “hands on” approach and “was very interested in the daily amounts of money going through and where he could get some cash”.\n\nStunt, 40, along with Sota, 34, and Alexander Tulloch, 41, all from London; as well as Gregory Frankel, 44, of West Yorkshire; Daniel Rawson, 45, of Leeds, and also Paul Miller, 45, of Wetherby, Heidi Buckler, 45 of Leeds and Bradford jeweller Haroon Rashid, 51, all deny money laundering. Stunt and Sota also deny one count of forgery. The trial continues.\n\nThe trial, which is expected to last four months, continues.\n\n",

    "date": "2022-04-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Wealthy Russians are trying to swap their luxury properties in London for multimillion-pound homes in Dubai as they seek innovative ways to circumvent financial restrictions imposed since the full invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA list of properties including a Knightsbridge mansion worth £34mn and a three-bed Eaton Square apartment with an £8mn asking price has been circulated in recent weeks by high-end real estate agents operating in the Gulf emirate.\n\nThey are being offered by Russians who are willing to barter their London properties for a new residence in Dubai, while avoiding bank transfers and financial scrutiny, according to people involved in the transactions. Prospective buyers are being offered deep discounts on the UK properties to complete the deals.\n\nThe mooted house swaps are the latest workaround on behalf of rich Russians who have found themselves frustrated by the western financial system since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. About 1,000 individuals and companies have so far been hit with sanctions, with others facing additional checks as well as difficulties navigating money transfers and opening bank accounts.\n\nBut there were doubts in Dubai over how a deal would be structured, and whether any United Arab Emirates residents would risk such an exchange.\n\n“I’m very sceptical that this can work, there’s just too much documentation to provide in London,” said one businessman in Dubai who was shown the list by a real estate agent. “But it goes to show the lengths they’re willing to go to evade the financial system.”\n\nOne Dubai-based lawyer said difficulties would arise because any transaction would need to account for stamp duty and other fee liabilities in both jurisdictions.\n\nYet others said that as long as the Russian seller was not under sanctions, such transactions could be structured effectively if purchase agreements were signed at each end. “This is perfectly legitimate,” said another lawyer in Dubai.\n\nDubai has become a favoured haven for Russians, and their often huge wealth, fleeing the west since hostilities broke out. The UAE has remained neutral on the conflict, ensuring that the Gulf state remains open for business for Russians and Ukrainians fleeing the war and its repercussions.\n\n“We’ve seen an influx of Russian clients since the start of the Ukrainian war and this has prompted us to set up a dedicated Russian desk to service them,” said Michael Kortbawi, partner at Dubai-based law firm BSA Ahmad Bin Hezeem & Associates. The closure of big international law firms in Moscow had also created a pool of talented people available for hire, he added.\n\nAbdullah Alajaji, founder of Dubai-based Driven Properties, said his firm had recorded sharply higher transaction values this year, mainly in ultra-high-end and waterfront properties.\n\n“We’re seeing a definite increase in activity in transaction values and volumes over the past few months, and that’s partly as a result of Russian buyers,” he said.\n\nLarge sums are being transferred by Russians despite UAE central bank guidance urging financial institutions to “manage their exposure to the risks associated with unilateral international financial sanctions programmes and restrictive measures implemented by other countries”.\n\nThe UAE enforces UN sanctions but not those introduced by the likes of the US, UK, EU or Switzerland.\n\nThe reluctance of some banks to deal with the higher risks associated with Russian clients has created difficulties for new arrivals, especially those without large amounts of money to deploy. These include delays in extricating funds from Europe and problems opening UAE bank accounts.\n\nThe decision in March by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force to add the UAE to its “dirty money” watchlist has complicated matters, with authorities keen to display better compliance.\n\nThe inflows of Russian money would be “a big test coming so soon after the FATF’s grey list decision”, said a western official.",

    "date": "2022-04-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has frozen the assets of the Kinahan drug trafficking gang, adding to international pressure on an organisation that has deep ties with boxers and promoters at the highest levels of the sport.\n\nThe Gulf state said it was continuing to investigate the Irish organised crime group in parallel with authorities in the US, UK, Ireland and Spain.\n\n“The relevant authorities co-operate closely on cases involving foreign elements, in line with the UAE’s international commitments and national legal framework for combating illicit activity,” the government said. The asset freeze includes all personal and corporate bank accounts, one person briefed on the matter in the UAE said.\n\nThe announcement of the asset freeze on one of Europe’s most notorious crime syndicates comes after the US Treasury last week imposed sanctions on the Kinahan group and seven of its members including its Irish leaders, Christopher Kinahan and his two sons, Daniel and Christopher Jr, who are based in Dubai.\n\nThe US also put a $5mn price on the heads of Kinahan Sr — better known as Christy or “the Dapper Don” and his sons. The US accused the Kinahans of smuggling narcotics into Europe and engaging in money laundering, frequently using Dubai as “a facilitation hub for its illicit activities”.\n\nThe US imposed sanctions on three companies linked to the clan, including a management consultancy controlled by Daniel Kinahan and a sports management company owned by one of his associates. Two of the companies — Hoopoe Sports and Ducashew General Trading — are based in Dubai. The US also indicated that Daniel Kinahan resides on Dubai’s Palm Jumeirah.\n\nThe sanctions on Daniel Kinahan, who has denied being a crime boss, have rocked the sport of boxing, where he has been credited with advising fighters and setting up bouts.\n\nTyson Fury, the world heavyweight champion, said this week that the sanctions were “none of my business”. Daniel Kinahan has advised Fury in the past but the boxer said he had not done any business dealings with him “for a long time”. In 2020, Fury thanked Kinahan for setting up a contest against rival Anthony Joshua. The matches never took place. Fury and Kinahan were photographed together in Dubai in February.\n\nMTK Global, a boxing agency co-founded by Daniel Kinahan in 2012, said on Wednesday that it was shutting down following the imposition of US sanctions on the Kinahans. The company, which has not itself been sanctioned, parted ways with Kinahan in 2017. It said it had faced “unprecedented levels of unfair scrutiny”.\n\nThe cartel, which emerged in the late 1990s, operates across Ireland, the UK, Spain and the UAE. Irish courts have branded it as “a murderous organisation” involved in the international trafficking of drugs and firearms, the US said.\n\nIn response to the UAE move, Ireland’s minister for justice Helen McEntee said: “The net is now clearly tightening on the Kinahan Organised Crime Group.”\n\nThe UAE has come under increasing scrutiny from western partners over its record in fighting money laundering. The Financial Action Task Force, a global financial crime watchdog, last month placed the UAE on its “grey list”, stepping up its monitoring of the Gulf state’s efforts to stem flows of dirty money.\n\nDubai, a playground for the rich, has also attracted organised criminal gangs from the UK, as well as India and former Soviet states.\n\nA combination of weak enforcement and investment opportunities for foreigners in sectors such as real estate and precious metals has created the perfect haven for criminals, according to a report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The asset freeze targeting the Kinahans forms part of a drive to clean up the UAE’s reputation and enhance co-operation with international law enforcement.",

    "body": "Investors keen on the listing of the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority bought up the shares by the bucketful on its first day of trading Tuesday. Dewa, as it is known, had already increased the size of its share offering twice before settling on $6.1bn for 18 per cent of the equity. That made it the largest initial public offering in the Middle East since Saudi Aramco in 2019. Its shares jumped 15 per cent on their debut valuing Dewa at almost $39bn.\n\nDubai has developed a reputation as a place for companies and individuals seeking lighter touch regulation, according to the Carnegie Endowment. Even so, its financial sector has fallen behind regional competitors in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. Dubai’s stock index has underperformed and new listings have failed to keep pace.\n\nDubai hopes a programme of partial privatisations starting with Dewa can improve matters. Others to come from a list of 10 include toll road operator Salik and district cooling operator Empower, which is 70 per cent owned by Dewa. One other privatisation which investors have awaited, that of Emirates airline, has yet to be announced.\n\nDewa’s power generation comes mostly from gas turbines. Just over a tenth is from renewables such as solar, which is expected to rise to 14 per cent at the end of this year.\n\nInvestors may well find Dewa’s monopoly status one of its most attractive features. Even so, Dubai’s government priced it attractively to ensure success. A dividend yield of more than 5 per cent competes well with international bonds offering just over 3 per cent.\n\nAt under 12 times this year’s expected ebitda Dewa should continue to attract investor attention. Regulated water and power utilities across Europe typically trade at mid-to-low teens multiples, though Dubai’s smaller market size deserves some valuation discount.\n\nSteadier infrastructure and utilities such as Dewa may pique investor interest at a time of rising interest rates. But whether Dubai can do the same with the rest of its privatisations, especially if a lacklustre global IPO market rebounds, is the tougher test.",

    "body": "Shares in Dubai’s state-owned utility soared on their market debut on Tuesday, after the region’s largest initial public offering since Saudi Aramco kicked off the emirate’s plans to revive capital markets through a series of privatisations.\n\nDubai Electricity & Water Authority shares surged as high as 23 per cent before ending 16 per cent higher after an IPO that raised $6.1bn.\n\nThe monopoly provider of water and electricity to the emirate’s 3.5m residents almost tripled the size of the stake sale to 18 per cent thanks to strong demand, with orders totalling $86bn from local and international investors.\n\n“Dewa’s a great company in a protected sector, which is also a bellwether for Dubai, so it’s a safe bet,” said Miguel Azevedo, Citigroup’s head of investment banking in the Middle East and Africa. “Investors like the combination of protection on the downside together with the secular growth of Dubai.”\n\nCiti, alongside Dubai’s Emirates NBD and HSBC, managed the share sale.\n\nThe flotation, the world’s second-largest this year, is expected to be followed by other part-privatisations of state-related assets, including Tecom business parks, road-toll system Salik and Empower, a cooling services provider.\n\nThe government is banking on the string of IPOs resurrecting the Dubai Financial Market, which has lagged behind regional behemoths in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, where volumes and valuations have soared after several state-owned and private sector listings.\n\nThe trade, transportation and tourism hub has witnessed a surge in activity from new residents thanks to its successful navigation of the pandemic, keeping its economy more open than its peers. The financial services sector has also grown quickly and the city is pitching itself as a regulatory centre for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has triggered a further influx of Russian cash into Dubai. The United Arab Emirates has remained neutral, resisting pressure to condemn Russia, with which it has developed close ties in recent years, especially through a common oil policy within the Opec+ group of producers.\n\nPopulation growth lies at the heart of Dewa’s growth prospects, which has a market valuation of $39bn following its debut. The emirate’s population is forecast to increase to almost 6m by 2040.\n\nThe government has announced plans to float 10 state firms, with the remaining six yet to be announced. Officials also say private companies are considering listings.\n\n“The message here is that DFM can generate demand to compete with all regional markets and offer potential issuers the liquidity,” said Mohamed Fahmi, co-head of investment banking at EFG Hermes, one of the bookrunners. “The level of demand should give comfort to upcoming issuers, both from the government or the private sector.”",

    "body": "Offshore financial centres specialise in low-profile ownership arrangements for the wealthy. They cannot be enjoying their current blaze of publicity. Scrutiny is high because Russian oligarchs habitually use offshore centres. Enemies of UK chancellor Rishi Sunak have also asked whether these bolt-holes feature in his family’s controversial finances.\n\nProviding sophisticated legal and financial services — and protection from tough onshore disclosure rules — are a big business for some small islands. The British Virgin Islands, for example, derived more than half of last year’s budget from fees of $196mn from setting up off-the-shelf companies.\n\nThe BVI crop up repeatedly in debates over offshore centres. The threat of blacklisting, pressure over transparency and last year’s Pandora Papers data leak cast a pall over the islands’ financial sector.\n\nThe benefits for host jurisdictions are not always obvious. In South Dakota, a US onshore secrecy hotspot, trust companies paid fees and tax of $6.5mn in 2021. That is despite soaring demand. In the decade to 2020, trust assets there went up more than fivefold to more than $500bn.\n\nJersey benefits more obviously from its trust industry, which holds about £1.1tn in assets and employs more than 4,000 people. The sector was expected to pay £3.4mn in regulatory fees in 2021 as well as corporate tax at a 10 per cent rate.\n\nOne big Jersey trust company, JTC, paid £692,000 in corporate tax in 2020. It brags that its private client business is becoming fashionable. The number of JTC clients paying fees over £100,000 increased by a quarter in 2020. The FTSE 250 company is highly valued at 21 times forward ebitda.\n\nSome trust providers have grown by acquisition. But they should beware of liabilities. In a court case last year involving Angola’s sovereign wealth fund, Jersey trust provider LGL was fined for missing red flags.\n\nJersey can still claim to be better regulated than many financial centres. Critical scrutiny now focuses on hubs such as Dubai. Jason Sharman, a University of Cambridge professor, expects it to benefit as disclosure-averse Russians take their money there. But this is hardly a feasible option for the families of UK politicians.\n\nThe Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

    "date": "2022-04-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Crypto firms are rushing to set up shop in Dubai after it started to offer virtual asset licences, making the Gulf state the latest jurisdiction to seek to become a haven for the global crypto industry.\n\nExchange Bybit, which last week said it would relocate its global headquarters from Singapore to Dubai, joins major industry players Crypto.com, FTX and Binance in establishing a foothold in the city.\n\nEnthusiasm for Dubai among crypto companies comes as their hopes for Singapore as a digital asset hub have faded. While Singapore has approved just a handful of crypto groups that applied for licences, Dubai has attracted several industry heavyweights in the few weeks since launching its licensing scheme.\n\nSingapore had been viewed as a budding crypto hub in Asia, after China cracked down on digital assets last year. Now, the crypto caravan has moved on as some companies turn their sights to a more receptive regulatory regime in the Gulf.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, who has moved from Singapore to Dubai, said the Gulf state’s government has attracted crypto companies with its “open mindset and a business friendly attitude”.\n\nBinance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, consulted on the rules under which it will now be regulated in Dubai. In December, Binance signed an agreement with Dubai World Trade Centre, a tax-free business park, to advise on the regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies in the emirate. The Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, which was launched earlier this month, has issued Binance a licence.\n\nZhao said Binance had lobbied for the formation of a bespoke regulator, describing the decision as “very excellent”, and praising Dubai authorities as “the smartest regulators and government officials any place in the world”.\n\nHowever, Dubai’s enthusiastic adoption of virtual assets has raised alarm in some financial circles, given the recent decision of the Financial Action Task Force, a global money laundering watchdog, to place the United Arab Emirates on its so-called “grey list” of enhanced monitoring of procedures for preventing the flow of dirty money.\n\nUK and US lawyers and former regulators said a licence from the emirate will probably do little to convince western regulators that crypto exchanges are under proper supervision.\n\nThe UK has also lodged a push to become a “global hub” for crypto, after City minister John Glen declared in a speech on Monday that the country wants to be attractive to “firms that don’t yet have a settled base”. However, lawyers note the government will need to induce British regulators including the FCA to be more receptive to crypto operators.\n\nDubai’s crypto charm offensive has quickly attracted several companies. FTX Europe, the Swiss-based arm of the exchange, in March said it would establish regional headquarters in Dubai after being granted a licence there. Singapore-based Crypto.com added a Middle East office in the city last week. BitOasis, a Dubai-based crypto exchange also received a provisional licence last week.\n\nBinance has chosen Dubai, where it already has about 200 staff across three offices, to be its regional headquarters, Zhao said. In comparison, he said: “The Singapore government takes a slightly more cautious approach.”\n\nBinance’s Singapore unit in December dropped its application for a licence to run a crypto business in the country after regulators ordered Binance Singapore to stop all crypto transfers with the global exchange binance.com, which the regulator placed on an investor alert list and said “may be in breach” of local law.\n\nOverall, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has granted just four crypto licences, after receiving 176 applications for oversight. More than a hundred companies have been turned away, while about several dozen are still hoping for the green light.\n\n“The very low success rate at MAS is discouraging the crypto sector in Singapore,” said Chia-Ling Koh, director at law firm Osborne Clarke, who compiled the figures.\n\nThe MAS also earlier this year instituted a sweeping ban on advertising for cryptocurrency, which has been interpreted as a “strong discouragement by MAS for offering crypto to consumers,” according to Nizam Ismail, chief executive of crypto consultancy Ethikom. “That seemed a little harsh. It was announced and implemented overnight.”\n\nIn a move ministers said would protect Singapore from “reputational risks”, lawmakers also tightened controls this week by passing new rules that will prevent crypto companies in the city-state from doing overseas business without a licence.\n\nXue Kai Pang, chief executive of Tokocrypto, a crypto exchange in nearby Indonesia said: “Singapore is definitely losing some of its shine and attractiveness . . . There are more open countries like Dubai.”",

    "date": "2022-04-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "The UN envoy to Yemen said warring parties in the country, where Iranian-backed rebels are fighting the Saudi-supported government, have accepted a two-month truce starting on Saturday.\n\nThe announcement by Hans Grundberg came days after both the Houthi rebels and the Saudi-backed government announced their own unilateral ceasefires, following an escalation in missile and drone attacks on oil installations in Saudi Arabia and retaliatory air strikes by the kingdom in Yemen.\n\nThe truce, coinciding with the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, would be the first mutually agreed ceasefire since 2016, a year after a Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen to stop the Houthis from seizing the country from the internationally recognised government.\n\nThe war, which has contributed to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from disease and malnutrition, has ground to a stalemate on most fronts.\n\n“The aim of this truce is to give Yemenis a necessary break from violence, relief from the humanitarian suffering and most importantly hope that an end to this conflict is possible,” Grundberg stated.\n\nUnder the terms, the Saudi-led coalition will let fuel ships enter the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah on the Red Sea, and commercial flights will be allowed from Sana'a airport “to pre-determined destinations in the region”, Grundberg said. He added he would oversee the reopening of a main road that has been a key government demand.\n\nThe most recent escalation in the conflict had come after forces supported by Saudi Arabia and its coalition ally the United Arab Emirates ousted the Houthis from the strategic Shabwa province. The Houthis responded by launching missile and drone attacks on oil facilities and an airport in the UAE, while increasing their attacks on Saudi Arabia.\n\nLast month a Houthi missile attack struck an Saudi Aramco distribution facility in Jeddah as the city prepared to host a Formula One grand prix race.\n\nThe war, initially backed by the US, has become a thorn in its relationship with Saudi Arabia, with President Joe Biden ending the sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia. But western diplomats say Saudi Arabia has been trying lately to find a way out of the war. The UAE scaled back its presence in 2019.\n\nAnalysts warned that implementing the truce would remain a challenge. “Like a lot of people, I was sceptical that a ceasefire was possible, and the question I have is what the X factor was here — what convinced everyone to make the compromises needed to get here?” said Peter Salisbury, senior Yemen analyst with the International Crisis Group.\n\n“As ever with these agreements, it’s a total battle to get to ‘yes’. But the even bigger challenge now will be taking what’s on paper and turn it into a reality,” he said.\n\nYemen expert Raiman al-Hamdani said the war had taken a toll on both sides, with the Houthis suffering from a lack of fuel and other resources, and the Saudis looking for an exit.\n\n“The agreement has come, I think, because it is economically induced. No longer can the Houthis survive without fuel and the blockade, Iran wants to sell oil internationally, the Saudis want to get out of the conflict, and at this point there are already certain factors that make it ripe,” he said.",

    "date": "2022-04-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "An Abu Dhabi state-owned investment company has been an investor in Israeli cyberweapon maker NSO Group since 2019, during which time NSO’s Pegasus spyware has been traced to the phones of journalists, human rights activists and the estranged wife of Dubai’s ruler.\n\nMubadala Capital, a unit of the $243bn fund chaired by Abu Dhabi’s crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, is one of the largest investors in the €1bn private equity fund that bought NSO three years ago, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMubadala’s €50mn commitment to the Novalpina Capital private equity fund — agreed in 2017 before the fund acquired NSO — means the Emirati government’s money was used to buy a significant Israeli cyberweapon manufacturer even before the two countries signed a peace accord in August 2020.\n\nThe US commerce department blacklisted NSO last year, saying it had supplied software to foreign governments that had used it to “maliciously target” government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics and embassy workers. NSO is facing lawsuits from Meta, which says it exploited a vulnerability in WhatsApp to deliver its spyware, and from Apple.\n\nHalf of the €50mn that Mubadala Capital committed to the Novalpina fund came from the sovereign wealth fund, which is run by Manchester City chair Khaldoon al-Mubarak, and half from outside investors whose money Mubadala Capital managed, one of the people said.\n\nThe investment was large enough to get Mubadala Capital a seat on a committee of the Novalpina fund’s biggest investors.\n\nMubadala Capital and NSO declined to comment. One person close to Mubadala said its “small role” in the fund was a passive role that meant it was notified only after an investment was made.\n\nA UK court found last year the ruler of Dubai, the neighbouring emirate, allowed his agents to use Pegasus to target the phones of his estranged wife, Princess Haya, and her British divorce lawyer, Baroness Fiona Shackleton.\n\nCitizen Lab has alleged that Ahmed Mansoor, an Emirati human rights activist, was targeted by NSO spyware in 2016.\n\nThe Israeli government has for years used NSO’s military-grade spyware as a diplomatic calling card to pry open relations with recalcitrant regimes, including Gulf countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn a sign of how much the UAE wanted unfettered access to the spyware, the government of Abu Dhabi held internal discussions about potentially buying the company outright in the autumn of 2021, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Those talks did not progress beyond preliminary conversations. Around that time, NSO said it had cancelled its contract with the UAE over the use of Pegasus to target the princess and her lawyer’s phone.\n\n“We sold this technology to these countries so they can fight together our common enemy, Iran,” said a senior Israeli cabinet minister. Any abuse of the software to spy on dissidents, academics or journalists is the responsibility of the nation deploying the software, not Israel, they said. “There is no regret.”\n\nMubadala Capital’s investment also draws it into a thorny dispute that centres on the Novalpina fund itself. Novalpina’s founders Stephen Peel, Stefan Kowski and Bastian Lueken were last year stripped of control of the fund and replaced with the US consultancy firm Berkeley Research Group, after investors decided the trio had fallen out so badly they could no longer work together.\n\nBRG accused Kowski and Lueken of a “malign” attempt to take back control of the fund, in a London lawsuit last month.\n\nIn response, Kowski said BRG was “mismanaging” the fund, and the pair said they had tried to ensure a smooth handover to BRG. They said they “did not give instructions” for proceedings to be started in a Luxembourg court to put the fund’s original manager, which they ran, back in charge.\n\nThe rating agency Moody’s downgraded NSO’s $500mn debts to the lower echelons of junk ratings in November. Credit Suisse, which was joint bookrunner alongside Jefferies when NSO took out the loans, is leading a consortium of NSO Group creditors alongside the hedge fund Senator, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The banks and Senator declined to comment.\n\nAmnesty International has previously accused groups including Oregon’s public employee retirement system and Alaska’s $81bn permanent fund of being “directly linked” to “human rights abuse” because of their investments in the Novalpina fund.\n\nAdditional reporting by Simeon Kerr in Dubai, Andrew England in Doha and James Fontanella-Khan in New York",

    "date": "2022-03-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Over the past six months, more than 20mn people have visited Expo 2020 in Dubai, but with just days to go before the end of the ‘world’s greatest show’, some of the hundreds of cleaners who have toiled at the exhibition site fear they have little to show for their efforts.\n\nOne cleaner who was hired in Ghana described paying hefty recruitment fees to a local agent in order to get the job. Repayments eat into her 1,000 dirhams a month salary, leaving her just Dh200 ($54) to send back to her family, less than she would have saved if she had remained at home.\n\n“My mother told me to come back home — I came to change my environment, but I am better off back in Ghana,” said the cleaner, who works for ADNH Compass, a joint venture between Abu Dhabi National Hotels and the UK-listed Compass Group.\n\nAdvocacy groups have long criticised the use of recruitment fees, illegal in the United Arab Emirates since 1980 and specifically barred by Expo’s management. The fees are often repaid over months or years and trap poorly paid migrant workers into contracts.\n\nDozens of workers, mainly cleaners, across the Expo site told the Financial Times they had paid recruitment fees. Others, including security guards, said they had not. Interviews with 69 Expo workers conducted by advocacy group Equidem found that 83 per cent had paid illegal fees or had not received their pay in full and on time.\n\n“Practically every major economy in the world is represented at Expo,” said Mustafa Qadri, Equidem’s founder. “The failure to protect migrant workers from forced labour practices at Expo reflects the international community’s inability to conduct adequate human rights due diligence.”\n\nPersistent claims of recruitment fee payments underscore concerns for worker welfare in the resource-rich region, which attracts millions of migrants in search of a better life.\n\nRecruitment fees, debt bondage and non-payment of wages remain commonplace in the UAE, according to the International Trade Union Confederation. Qatar, which has come under sustained criticism over worker rights, has argued that hosting of this year’s Fifa football world cup has prompted better standards, including the introduction of a minimum wage.\n\n“Despite significant attention and effort, recruitment fees remain the norm, not the exception,” in the Gulf, said James Corah, head of sustainability at CCLA Investment Management. The UK-based asset manager leads a collaborative initiative backed by investor assets of more than £7tn calling on companies to find and remedy instances of forced labour.\n\nWorkers at Expo hired from countries such as Nepal and Ghana jumped at the opportunity to come to the UAE to support their families and build savings for education or a property.\n\nYet across the site, a couple of dozen cleaners told the Financial Times how they had dipped into savings or borrowed thousands of dollars to pay illegal recruitment fees to agents. Cleaners employed by Swiss-owned Farnek also complained of paying recruitment fees to agents and low pay.\n\nMoney paid to recruitment agents from loans or life savings ranged from Dh2,000 to Dh8,000. Some people are still paying back the fees in instalments of up to Dh500 a month, reducing the amount they can remit to families. The payments continue even when the work is over.\n\nSeveral Indian and Sri Lankan cleaners working for Farnek also said they had paid fees of around Dh5,000 to agents in south Asia. One said he managed to send back around Dh700 a month out of his Dh1,000 salary. “But I owe Dh7,500 and need more money to send back to my large family in Chennai.”\n\nADNH Compass, which provides free food and accommodation, said any substantiated allegation of paying illegal fees to agencies would be “reimbursed by the agent or us”. Farnek said it does not recruit workers who have paid fees, saying they all must confirm in writing that they have not paid any agency fees. Expo said some workers believe these payments are necessary to secure employment.\n\nCorah welcomed Compass’ steps in addressing labour standards and the firm’s practice of investigating all allegations of recruitment fee payments and reimbursing workers. “In addition to the personal tragedy for workers, the regulatory and reputational risks for companies that get this wrong are growing,” he said. “Investors are watching.”\n\nExpo said issues surrounding pay and recruitment fees are not systemic across the large workforce operating in a place the size of a city, where 100,000 people are on site daily. “While full compliance is not always tenable, Expo 2020 Dubai has set high standards in worker welfare,” it said. “Expo conducts rigorous inspections of its service providers and employees sign an undertaking that they have not paid fees to recruitment agents.”\n\nExpo cleaners are paid Dh1,000 a month in accordance with International Labour Organization recommendations. Farnek said its workers were earning “considerably more” than in their home countries.\n\nBut many of those workers are now worried about returning home empty-handed. Two ADNH Compass staff said they were told that 650 of the 1,000 Expo cleaners would be let go and repatriated at the end of the month. They later said the company had committed to try to find them new jobs.\n\n“Although every effort will be made to redeploy staff post-Expo, there is no guarantee,” ADNH Compass said. “All employees were made aware of this at the time of recruitment.”",

    "body": "NMC came out of administration on Friday, ending two years of uncertainty after debts racked up in an alleged fraud threatened to destroy the United Arab Emirates’ largest private healthcare group.\n\nThe scandal at NMC left creditors with large outstanding debts. The company collapsed in 2020 after revealing more than $4bn in previously undisclosed liabilities across NMC and other businesses founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty.\n\nA new NMC group, NMC OpCo Ltd, has been formed from 34 of the 36 companies that were subject to the administration proceedings under the courts of Abu Dhabi’s international financial centre, allowing the healthcare operations to continue to trade normally.\n\n“This is a new beginning for the organisation. The companies are on a very stable footing,” Michael Davis, chief executive, told the Financial Times. “We are focused on growth — there is an upside we see.”\n\nThe group is now planning to expand its hospitals and clinics, build new revenue streams and find cost efficiencies.\n\nIn 2021, NMC recorded gross revenue of 4.51bn UAE dirhams ($1.23bn) and ebitda of Dh755mn, with a strong performance from its cosmetic surgery and fertility hospitals.\n\nThe UK’s NMC Healthcare PLC and UAE-registered NMC Healthcare Ltd will remain in administration, allowing Alvarez & Marsal to continue its investigation and pursue potential avenues to recover funds for creditors.\n\nShetty has launched legal proceedings in the US against the former management, auditor EY and two banks, claiming they participated in a complex $5bn fraud. EY denies any wrongdoing.\n\nNMC’s lenders have been provided with a new $2.25bn facility under the restructuring to settle their previous debt claims.\n\nThey have selected seven new directors, most of whom represent companies that provided new capital to help keep the business afloat and enable it to launch a three-year growth plan, including divestments.\n\nThe company said its new board would help “embed a robust governance framework”.\n\nThe new chair, Kevin Taylor, group treasurer of Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, is one of three directors appointed by ADCB, which had an exposure of around $1bn and placed NMC into administration in April 2020.\n\nThis week, NMC sold its stake in a Saudi joint venture to refocus on its core markets, said Davis.\n\n“Saudi Arabia is not an easy place to work,” he said. “I love Saudi, but in looking at what is best for NMC and to ensure the greatest return to stakeholders, we needed to focus just on the UAE and Oman.”",

People briefed on discussions said the Gulf states would be more willing to co-operate if President Joe Biden addressed their security concerns, particularly Iran and Iranian backed rebels in Yemen. They are also concerned about a possible revival of the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, believing it would embolden the Islamic republic and its proxies.\n\n“The message from the Saudis and the UAE is we will come back [to the US fold], if you come back bearing a plan, and that message has been delivered,” said one of the people briefed on the discussions. “They have seen the low in relations, but they are picking up a lot of signals that the Biden administration is getting the message. You’re going to see headway in diplomatic activity over the next few weeks.”\n\nBoth the UAE and Saudi Arabia have become increasingly disillusioned with what they consider Washington’s unpredictability and disengagement. The Gulf states have forged closer relations with Putin in recent years, and both co-operate with Russia on oil production levels in Opec+.\n\nRelations between the UAE and Washington hit a low after what Abu Dhabi perceived to be the Biden administration’s tepid response to a string of Houthi missile and drone attacks this year. The US did deploy additional military assets to the UAE, part of the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015. But Abu Dhabi wants Washington to do more and reinstate a terrorist designation on the Houthis, lifted by Biden in 2021.\n\nThe UAE angered the US by abstaining on a UN Security Council vote in February condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in a public display of its frustration with the Biden administration. It also upset Washington by hosting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad last week, the first Arab state to do so since he launched a brutal war to crush the 2011 popular uprising.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been frustrated by Biden’s criticism of the kingdom’s human rights record, his decision to end US support for a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis and his decision not to engage directly with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s day-to-day ruler.\n\nBiden also ordered the release of a US intelligence report that concluded that Prince Mohammed must have authorised the 2018 operation in which Saudi agents murdered veteran journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.\n\nA senior Biden administration official told the Financial Times that when Biden spoke to King Salman last month “they set forth an affirmative bilateral agenda from climate, to security, to energy co-operation”.  Since then, “our teams have been engaged at every level,” the official said, adding that they were “committed to working together to help the Saudis strengthen their defences”. The US has recently greenlighted the transfer of interceptor missiles for Saudi Arabia’s Patriot air defence systems from regional countries to help the kingdom replenish its diminished stocks.\n\nWashington has described reports that Prince Mohammed and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, the UAE’s de facto leader, refused to take Biden’s calls as inaccurate. “No one has asked for that [a call with between Biden and Prince Mohammed]. It is not an active debate. If the Saudis came to the administration and said that the Feb 9 call should be with the crown prince and not the king, we would have done it with the crown prince,” said a person familiar with the administration’s thinking.\n\nAnother person familiar with the situation said the UK was encouraging rapprochement between the US and Saudi Arabia, where British prime minister Boris Johnson held talks with Prince Mohammed last week.\n\n“You need the Saudis on the Russia-Ukraine crisis, on energy and on Iran with the nuclear talks,” the person said. “Rapprochement between the US and Saudi Arabia could have a really positive effect.” However, the person added that while the US understood this politically, “it’s very difficult for Biden to completely reverse course”.\n\nSenior British officials said they were confident that Saudi and the UAE would pump more oil. “Mohammed bin Salman was very keen to be helpful,” said one. “He wants the prime minister’s help to rebuild relations with the US.”\n\nAn official in the Gulf said that Riyadh considers the crisis a moment to gain more leverage on the US and move “beyond the Khashoggi killing”.\n\nAli Shihabi, a Saudi commentator familiar with the leadership’s thinking, said Saudi Arabia was interested in a good relationship with America “but it wants to be treated with respect”.\n\nAdditional reporting by George Parker in London and Felicia Schwartz in Washington",

    "blurb": "Government should rethink relations with ferry operator and its owner",
    "date": "2022-03-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "In an era when many companies trumpet their commitment to treating all stakeholders fairly, some are all too ready to do the wrong thing. Everything about P&O Ferries’ sacking of 800 crew last week — the brief video statement, the coach loads of waiting replacement agency workers, the security contractors standing by — suggests it was meticulously orchestrated. Only the seafarers themselves had no prior warning. The UK government has asked the Insolvency Service to investigate whether P&O breached employment law. Whatever the precise legalities, P&O and its owner, Dubai’s DP World, appear to have made a cynical calculation to rapidly shrink the ferry operator’s cost base by ignoring contemporary British standards on how to treat employees — and their implicit contract with broader society.\n\nIn laying off 800 UK-based seafarers with immediate effect and no consultation, P&O showed contempt, too, for British taxpayers, who provided it with £10mn in furlough support in 2020; the company also received £4.4mn through a government contingency plan to keep cargo flowing. DP World paid £270mn in dividends to shareholders that year. P&O’s actions also demonstrated scant regard for safety — with agency workers suddenly expected to take on skilled work on some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes — or for the resulting supply chain disruptions.\n\nA company as large as P&O, responsible for about a third of the cross-channel ferry market with France, will no doubt have taken legal advice before its announcement. UK law stipulates a minimum 45-day consultation period when a company makes more than 100 employees redundant. This is aside from the collective bargaining arrangement P&O had with Nautilus International, the seafarers’ union, which has announced a formal dispute. According to unions and an internal P&O letter, the 800 sacked crew were on Jersey-based contracts. But Nautilus has claimed their jobs still fell under UK law and protections since this was the jurisdiction specified in their contracts. Some employment lawyers also argue UK statutory protections should apply if Britain was the place of employment.\n\nFor employees, however, a UK employment tribunal would probably take a year to be heard, and they would initially bear the costs. P&O seems likely to have reckoned that, in a looming cost of living crisis, most employees would accept a package similar to what they might achieve at a tribunal, if successful, and move on. A company losing £100mn a year, hit first by the pandemic and now by inflation and soaring fuel prices, needs to restructure. But this is no way to go about it.\n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, billionaire ruler of Dubai, the state that ultimately owns P&O, could easily afford the £554mn a London court ordered him to pay his ex-wife in a high-profile divorce case last year — although the negative publicity the case generated was less easy to write off. DP World now faces its own reputational reckoning, with multiple legal challenges set to come P&O’s way.\n\nThis case should be especially sensitive for a Conservative government that has insisted that UK pay in many sectors would increase, post-Brexit, as businesses would no longer be able to rely on “cheap foreign labour”. It highlights the need to ensure that statutory protections for UK-based workers are strong enough and properly enforced. If P&O is found to have broken UK employment law, it should bear the legal consequences. The government should also reconsider whether its parent DP World’s Gateway and Southampton ports should still benefit from its freeport scheme.",

    "body": "Boris Johnson is hoping to line up major Saudi investment in British renewable energy on a visit to Riyadh on Wednesday, during which he will urge the desert kingdom to increase oil production to tackle market volatility.\n\nBut ahead of the trip the UK prime minister was accused by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer of going “cap in hand from dictator to dictator” to beg for help, arguing that Johnson should have put in place a more balanced energy strategy years ago.\n\nJohnson will fly to the Middle East overnight on Tuesday for talks in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in an attempt to convince the two countries to help boost energy supplies and stabilise markets disrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK announced last week that it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year.\n\nLord Gerry Grimstone, investment minister, has been wooing the Saudis for months over a possible sovereign investment into UK green energy projects, which are at the heart of Johnson’s plan to reduce Britain’s consumption of imported oil and gas.\n\nLast year the UAE pledged to invest £10bn in UK clean energy, technology and infrastructure; Grimstone hopes the Saudi government will also put money into the sector.\n\nOne government insider said the investment being sought would be a “big number”. Downing Street confirmed “we’ll be talking about developing renewable energy capacity”.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which is the world’s top crude exporter and has been coordinating with Russia in Opec+, has been reluctant to pump more oil during the Ukraine crisis. Johnson’s visit to the country has been overshadowed by the execution of 81 individuals on terrorism-related charges on March 13.\n\nStarmer told the Financial Times: “Going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy. Saying we are not going to rely on Russia and then going to Saudi Arabia is not an energy strategy.”\n\nThe opposition leader said Johnson was right to explore ways to cut people’s energy bills, but that going to Saudi Arabia would not have been necessary had there been a more effective strategy in place.\n\nStarmer argued that Britain has been too slow to develop new nuclear power stations and that the halt in the rollout in onshore wind under the Tory government had also caused problems.\n\nHe said human rights issues in Saudi Arabia were “a real cause for concern” and that Labour had said it would not supply arms for use by the Saudi government in its war in Yemen. Starmer said there were also “real questions” about the acquisition of Newcastle United last year by a Saudi-led consortium.\n\nHe argued that Johnson should focus on more solar and hydrogen power and the insulation of homes, rather than ingratiating himself with Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince.\n\nDowning Street said Johnson would raise human rights issues on his visit, while the prime minister’s allies hit back at Starmer, who they said was not interested in providing Britain with jobs and energy security.\n\nAsked by Sky News if he was seeking help from “unpleasant” countries such as Saudi Arabia in order to counter the threat posed by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, Johnson said it was necessary to “build the widest possible coalition”.\n\nOne colleague of Johnson said: “He lives in the real world where we must turn to allies around the world to help us confront Putin, grow our economy and relieve the mounting cost of living pressure on our people.”\n\nAs part of Johnson’s visit, Saudi Arabia’s Alfanar group will confirm a £1bn investment in the Lighthouse Green Fuels Project in Teesside, which will produce sustainable aviation fuel from waste.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nRedirect savings to fund energy transition / From Richard Murphy, Professor of Accounting Practice, Sheffield University Management School, Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK",

    "body": "Dubai has kicked off plans to boost its capital markets by selling stakes in 10 state-owned businesses with the IPO of its monopoly electricity and water provider.\n\nIn its intention to float statement on Tuesday, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority said it would offer 3.25bn shares, or 6.5 per cent of its share capital, in what could be one of the largest listings ever in the emirate. Officials and bankers have previously said the listing could value Dewa at around 100bn dirhams ($27.2bn).\n\n“Dubai’s fast paced development has resulted in a rapid increase in the demand for electricity and water,” chief executive Saeed Al Tayer said in a statement. “And Dewa has grown along with Dubai’s expanding economy, population and world-class competitive infrastructure.” Electricity demand grew 11 per cent in 2021, ahead of the forecast 4 per cent, he said.\n\nThe Dewa IPO is part of a plan to revive Dubai’s moribund capital markets with a series of part-privatisations, as well as the expansion of market making and support for technology firms seeking to list on the Dubai Financial Market.\n\nThe government aims to boost its domestic markets after falling behind regional competitors Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, where volume and valuations have soared in recent years.\n\nDubai has also revealed plans to float other government and state-related entities, including Salik, the road toll unit of the transportation authority; Empower, another utility; and business park operator Tecom.\n\nIt has yet to announce the other six businesses being readied for privatisation, with bankers anticipating they include a part of Dubai’s corporate crown jewel, Emirates Group, which owns the airline and a range of other airport and travel services, or even the sale of shares in the international airline itself, as travel demand has recovered.\n\nDubai, which was initially hit hard by the pandemic, has rebounded quickly as wealthy people flocked there to escape lockdowns elsewhere. The regional business hub kept its economy open alongside public health restrictions.\n\nWar in Ukraine has now sparked another inflow of money, with rich Russians flocking to the emirate as sanctions have tightened and the conflict intensified.\n\nOutlining its growth opportunities, Dewa said Dubai has around 3.5mn residents and an active daytime population of 4.7mn, with the figures expected to rise to 5.8mn and 7.8mn respectively by 2040.\n\nThe company’s adjusted ebitda was Dh12.1bn in 2021 with net income of Dh6.6bn. Net debt stood at Dh17.6bn.\n\nThe company is also integral to the emirate’s efforts to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Around 11.4 per cent of its power capacity comes from renewable sources, including the world’s largest single-site solar park, with an expected increase to 14 per cent by the end of this year.\n\nDewa said there was “substantial” interest in the flotation and doubted that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would derail its plans.",

    "blurb": "Gulf state reaffirms loyalty to group hours after its US ambassador said it favoured higher output",
    "date": "2022-03-1000:00:00.0",
    "body": "The United Arab Emirates has reaffirmed its commitment to the Opec+ production agreement, in what appeared to be an about-turn hours after its US ambassador said the Gulf state favoured higher output.\n\nIn comments seemed designed to reassure fellow Opec members, Suhail Al Mazrouei, the UAE’s energy minister, said on Thursday that his country believed “in the value Opec+ brings to the oil market”.\n\n“The UAE is committed to the Opec+ agreement and its existing monthly production adjustment mechanism,” he said on Twitter.\n\nBrent crude prices, the international oil benchmark, rose more than 4 per cent on Thursday morning to $117.58 a barrel. They had dropped on Wednesday after Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE’s powerful ambassador in Washington, said Abu Dhabi favoured “production increases and will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels”.\n\nThe apparently conflicting messages from the UAE suggested that Abu Dhabi wanted to send a message to the Biden administration that it was willing to help an ally after a period of tense relations, but also that, as a member of Opec+, it had little space to do anything unilaterally.\n\n“The position of the UAE is clear — the underlying policy is that we stick with Opec+. However, Otaiba has to do his job to keep the Americans happy,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political science professor.\n\nThe Gulf’s oil producers have been under pressure from the Biden administration to pump more crude to help bring down oil prices, which have hit their highest levels in more than a decade in the weeks since Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine.\n\nBut Opec+, which includes Russia, has resisted US pressure. Otaiba was the first senior official from an Opec member to call on the alliance to boost its production.\n\nAnalysts say Gulf producers believe that oil prices are being driven by geopolitical events rather than supply and that there is limited capacity to boost output.\n\nThe Opec+ alliance has declined to go beyond a plan agreed last year to increase production each month by 400,000 barrels a day, and some members, including Nigeria, Angola and Malaysia, have consistently failed to meet their production quotas since that deal was reached.\n\nBy January the group’s total production was 900,000 b/d below its target, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nOpec spare capacity — often defined as additional production that can be brought online in 30 days and sustained for 90 days — was roughly 3.2 mn b/d in January, according to JPMorgan.\n\nThat is below both the 5mn b/d global spare capacity buffer normally required to prevent oil market volatility and the amount that would be needed to replace Russian oil in the event of a global embargo. The only producers with significant spare capacity are Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent, the UAE.\n\nGulf states have been careful to tread a neutral line on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and also want to avoid being drawn into US politics by rising petrol prices ahead of midterm election politics later this year.\n\nThe UAE angered its western partners when it abstained on a UN Security Council vote condemning Russia, in what was an expression of Abu Dhabi’s frustration with the Biden administration.\n\nOfficials say the UAE has been infuriated by what it perceives as an insufficient US response to its security needs in the wake of missile and drone attacks by Iranian-aligned Yemeni rebels targeting Abu Dhabi in January. US officials believe its response to the Houthi threat was adequate.\n\nThe UAE did vote alongside the US in a non-binding UN General Assembly vote critical of Moscow’s invasion, and Otaiba’s statement appeared to be a further effort to ease tensions with Washington.\n\nSheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE’s foreign minister, spoke to US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Wednesday to discuss ways to strengthen co-operation.\n\n“There is plenty of stress in the UAE-US relationship — indeed we never had it as bad as these days — but the blame is on Washington and Biden,” said Abdulla. “The real issue is the lack of American commitment to the UAE and Saudi Arabia and the fact that DC is not as responsive as it used to be.”\n\nThe Opec secretariat was not informed ahead of Otaiba ’s statement, a person familiar with the matter said. It was not clear if the UAE engaged with Saudi Arabia, Opec’s de facto leader and the UAE’s closest Gulf ally, ahead of the diplomat’s statement, which was welcomed by Blinken.\n\nSaudi Arabia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The UAE became embroiled in a dispute with Saudi Arabia last year after Abu Dhabi wanted to increase its production quota, and Otaiba’s comments risked annoying Riyadh.",

    "blurb": "Gulf emerges as potential haven amid toughened financial rules",
    "date": "2022-03-1000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Russians have flocked to set up businesses and buy property in the United Arab Emirates in an effort to secure residence and park assets in the Gulf as the US, UK and EU tighten financial sanctions, relocation experts, brokers and lawyers said.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine, western sanctions on the Russian central bank and the removal of some lenders from the Swift messaging network have made it harder for Russians to establish themselves outside their home country.\n\nSome are looking to the UAE, long a financial haven for those fleeing instability as well as a popular tourism and investment destination for Russians. There are already an estimated 40,000 Russians and 15,000 Ukrainians in the UAE, along with about 60,000 Russian-speaking expatriates from former Soviet states. Oligarchs’ superyachts often drop anchor in Dubai, a playground for the super-rich.\n\n“Russians are now unwelcome banking customers in Europe, even though the majority went there to get away from Putin,” said Peter Gray, partner at ADG Legal in Dubai. “People are worried about what the banks will do — the banks are afraid of sanctions and expensive investigations and so are reluctant to continue business with Russian nationals, regardless of their political affiliation.”\n\nWhile the UAE has long committed itself to enforcing previous UN sanctions, the commercial hub is a potential bolt-hole for those avoiding national restrictions as the Gulf state charts a relatively neutral stance in the Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe UAE abstained on a UN Security Council vote condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine while backing a subsequent general assembly motion. It reversed an early decision to cancel visa-free access for Ukrainians. Abu Dhabi has fostered close ties with Moscow in recent years, joining forces against Islamist forces across the region and co-operating on energy policy.\n\nEstablishing businesses in the UAE allows Russians to secure visas for themselves and their families. Virtuzone, which helps companies set up in the UAE, has seen interest surge from Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians since war broke out.\n\n“I am receiving 50 inquiries a day — it’s booming right now,” said Maryia Vinahradava, who heads Virtuzone’s Russian-speaking team, citing one Russian company with about 500 employees which wants to relocate to Dubai. Before the crisis, she got a new business lead every two days.\n\n“People are worried about business continuity,” she said. “One trader had received a notification from their lawyer in Germany that they could no longer continue their trading activities with Japan and China from there and advised him to open up in the UAE.”\n\nBuying property is another option for people wanting to move to the UAE. An investment of Dh750,000 ($204,000) in real estate secures three years’ residence; larger investments can secure longer-term “golden visas”.\n\nWhile anyone trying to move money to the UAE from banks under sanctions would “face a problem”, Vinahradava said, other lenders are managing to move funds into the Gulf state.\n\nWith financial institutions increasingly concerned about censure, Russians are nonetheless finding the space for basic financial transactions narrowing. Western sanctions on Russia’s financial system have raised already high barriers to opening a bank account.\n\n“Opening an account is difficult,” said one Russian businessman based in Dubai for more than two decades. “If you have another account in a non-sanctioned country, it’s fine. But if it’s from Russia, then you are in trouble and at the mercy of the bank — 90 per cent are rejected.”\n\nIn some cases, Russians are also turning to cryptocurrencies and informal money exchanges, known as hawala, according to the businessman. “There are plenty of guys who can facilitate this out on the Palm [Jumeirah],” he said, referring to the luxurious, man-made development on Dubai’s coast that is popular with Russians. “Once you have the cash, or even better a banker’s cheque, then it’s easy to buy a property or do something else with the assets.”\n\nSome real estate agents in Dubai also said higher-profile brokerages, including Knight Frank, had referred Russian clients to them. Knight Frank declined to comment. People aware of its business operations denied there was any outright ban on Russians but said all clients faced stringent due diligence for compliance purposes.\n\nThe new financial inflows come at a particularly sensitive time for the UAE, which on Friday was placed on the Financial Action Task Force’s “grey list”. This means increased monitoring by the inter-governmental agency of their efforts to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe UAE hosts the top names in global finance at two international centres in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Its real estate and commodities markets have long been prone to abuse by money launderers and tax evaders. After Friday’s meeting, the FATF said all jurisdictions should be vigilant against money laundering that “risks resulting from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine”.\n\nEmirati officials have said the country would welcome Russian investors and Ukrainian refugees while acknowledging western sanctions.\n\nLocal lenders also voiced caution. They can still open accounts for Russians, but it is “no longer a simple or easy thing to do”, said one banking executive. “With these new sanctions in place, banks will find it much harder to accept transfers from Russia, in any form,” he said.",

But the Opec+ alliance, which includes Russia, has declined to go beyond a plan agreed last year to increase production each month by 400,000 barrels a day.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, traded as high as $131.64 a barrel on Wednesday, but pulled back sharply to about $111 following the comments from the UAE. Iraq also indicated on Wednesday that it was prepared to increase output if required.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Suhail Al Mazrouei, the UAE’s energy minister, tweeted that the country remained “committed to the Opec+ agreement and its existing monthly production adjustment mechanism”.\n\nThe UAE is a close ally of Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of Opec, which has resisted US calls to raise production. However, last year Abu Dhabi became embroiled in a dispute with Riyadh over output quotas.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the UAE had co-ordinated with Saudi Arabia on its plans to encourage Opec to increase production.\n\nBut Abu Dhabi’s position will be welcomed by the Biden administration, which is concerned about rising prices at American petrol pumps and the impact of soaring energy costs on the global economy.\n\nAnalysts caution that there is little spare production capacity globally, with only Saudi Arabia able to significantly raise output, and the UAE to a lesser degree. They add that even a co-ordinated move might have limited impact.\n\n“They know there is not enough spare capacity to fill a Russia-sized hole,” said Amrita Sen, at Energy Aspects. She added it was not surprising that the UAE was the first Opec member to voice support for increasing production, as it had previously indicated it would like to raise its exports.\n\nSome Opec members, including Nigeria, Angola and Malaysia, have consistently failed to meet their production quotas since the most recent Opec+ agreement was reached last year.\n\nBy January the group’s total production was 900,000 b/d below its target, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nMohammed Barkindo, Opec’s secretary-general, warned this week that there was “no capacity in the world at the moment that can replace 7mn barrels [a day] of exports” from Russia.\n\nGulf states have been careful to tread a neutral line on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, partly because they co-operate in Opec+ on agreed levels of production in a more than five-year alliance that was intended to keep oil prices at sustainable levels.\n\nThe UAE is considered one of the US’s most important Arab partners, but relations between Abu Dhabi and Washington have been increasingly strained in recent weeks.\n\nThe Gulf state, which took up a temporary seat on the UN Security Council this year, rankled American policymakers by abstaining on a US resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe abstention reflected Abu Dhabi’s mounting frustration with the Biden administration, particularly what Emirati officials perceive to be Washington’s timid response to attacks on the UAE by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen.\n\nThe US has deployed additional military assets to the UAE, which is part of a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 to fight the Iran-allied Houthis. But Abu Dhabi wants Washington to designate the Houthis a terrorist organisation and impose tougher sanctions on the Yemeni group.\n\nThe Biden administration has been reluctant to do so amid warnings that such a move would exacerbate Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe UAE is also concerned about the prospects of the Biden administration sealing a deal with Iran to revive the 2015 nuclear accord, fearing it will embolden the Islamic republic and its proxies.\n\nOtaiba, who is one of the most influential Emirati officials, said last week that the UAE and the US were “going through a stress test but I’m confident that we will get out of it and get to a better place”.\n\nHelima Croft, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets and a former CIA analyst, said the US still needed to offer something to Saudi Arabia if it wanted to secure the world’s top oil exporter’s help in driving down oil prices.\n\n“What is in the US offer letter to Saudi Arabia to get them to essentially walk away from the Opec+ arrangement?”\n\nRelations between Riyadh and Washington have been strained since Biden took office. The president has criticised the kingdom over human rights abuses, including the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, and promised to reassess relations with Saudi Arabia, and to not engage with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the day-to-day ruler.",

    "body": "The global financial crimes watchdog has placed the United Arab Emirates on its grey list, dealing a blow to the Middle East’s premier finance and trade hub.\n\nThe Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said in a report on Friday that it had added the oil-rich Gulf state to other nations “subject to increased monitoring”, putting the UAE on a list of 22 other nations that includes Syria, Albania, Panama and South Sudan.\n\nFATF said the UAE had made a “high-level commitment to work with the watchdog on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing and had made “significant improvements” to improve it systems.\n\nBut the grey listing will hurt the reputation of the Gulf state, which has long prided itself as the destination of choice for international banks and multinationals operating in the Middle East.\n\nThe UAE, and Dubai in particular, has long garnered a reputation for the ease of moving large sums of cash in and out of the nation and lax scrutiny in sectors such as real estate deals.\n\nInclusion on the FATF’s watchlist is not expected to deter financial institutions looking to set up in the UAE, Gulf-based bankers have previously said. But the reputational damage could raise costs for local banks doing business with global counterparts and complicate compliance issues for international lenders.\n\nIn 2020, the FATF said the UAE’s limited number of money-laundering prosecutions, especially in Dubai, were a “concern” and urged the country to strengthen its anti-money laundering measures.\n\nAhead of the report, Emirati officials said the UAE had taken many steps to address the FATF’s concerns and had significantly increased the authorities’ ability to clamp down on flows of “dirty money” in all seven emirates of the federation.\n\nThis has included creating a register of corporate beneficial ownership that can supply requested information to international counterparties in just three days. The UAE has also signed extradition treaty agreements with 33 countries including the UK, India and China.\n\nSectors prone to financial abuse, such as real estate, have been brought under the umbrella of the federally managed anti-money laundering reporting system.\n\nThe UAE’s Executive Office of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism said late on Friday after the report’s release that the Gulf state takes “its role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system extremely seriously”.\n\nIt added in a statement that it would work closely with the FATF “to quickly remedy the areas of improvement identified”.\n\n“On this basis, the UAE will continue its ongoing efforts to identify, disrupt and punish criminals and illicit financial networks in line with FATF’s findings and the UAE’s National Action Plan, as well as through close co-ordination with our international partners,” it said.\n\nFATF said that as part of an action plan, the UAE must provide additional resources to its financial intelligence unit to strengthen its analysis function and ability to pursue high-risk money laundering threats; demonstrate a sustained increase in effective investigations and prosecutions of different types of money laundering; and proactively identify and combat sanctions evasion.",
