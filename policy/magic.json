Purpose. The United States must grow its economy and maintain \njobs for its citizens while playing a leadership role in global efforts to \nprotect the environment. Over decades, with the help of sensible policies that do not encumber private-sector activity, the United States has simulta-neously grown its economy, raised worker wages, increased energy produc-tion, reduced air and water pollution, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The United States’ successful track record of advancing both economic and environmental objectives should be a model for other countries. \nIn recent years, the United States has purported to join international agree-\nments and initiatives that do not reflect our country’s values or our contribu-tions to the pursuit of economic and environmental objectives. Moreover, these agreements steer American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of my Administration to put the interests \nof the United States and the American people first in the development \nand negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy. These agreements must not unduly or unfairly burden the United States. \nSec. 3. Implementation. (a) The United States Ambassador to the United \nNations shall immediately submit formal written notification of the United \nStates’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The notice shall be submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Depositary of the Agree-ment, attached as Appendix A. The United States will consider its withdrawal from the Agreement and any attendant obligations to be effective immediately upon this provision of notification. \n(b) The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall immediately \nsubmit written formal notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, or any relevant party, of the United States’ withdrawal from any agreement, pact, accord, or similar commitment made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n(c) The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collaboration \nwith the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, shall immediately cease or revoke any purported financial commitment made by the United States under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n(d) Immediately upon completion of the tasks listed in subsections (a), \n(b), and (c), the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collabora-tion with the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury shall certify a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that describes in detail any further action required to achieve the policy objectives set forth in section 2 of this order. \n(e) The U.S. International Climate Finance Plan is revoked and rescinded \nimmediately.

Public comments are encouraged for further refinement.",

    "body": "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \nFederal Trade Commission \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20580 \nOffice of the Chair \nJanuary 17, 2025 \nIn response to requests for guidance on legislation that would secure Americans’ right to \nrepair their products, I am making available the draft text below. \nRight to Repair Act1 \nSection 1. Title \nThis chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the Right to Repair Act. \nSection 2. Findings \nA. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has extensively studied the ability of customers \nto easily and cost -effectively repair the products that they already own and found that \nproducts have become increasingly difficult to repair due to manufacturers’ repair \nrestrictions. \nB. These repair restrictions take a variety of forms, including: \n1. physical restrictions that limit the ability to open devices or physically remove and \nreplace component parts; \n2. the unavailability of repair parts, manuals, and diagnostic software and tools; \n3. product designs that make independent repair less safe; \n4. steering consumers to manufacturers’ repair networks through the use of telematics systems; \n5. unfairly asserting intellectual property rights; \n6. disparaging aftermarket parts and independent repair services; \n1 This draft legislation reflects the views of Chair Lina M. Khan and not those of the Commission , any other \nCommissioner , or FTC staff. \n1 \n  \n \n     \n  \n    \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n   \n   \n  \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n   \n    \n   \n  \n    \n \n   \n \n 7. imposing software locks, requiring the pairing of parts, or using other technologies \nthat impede independent repairs; and \n8. selling products with attendant end user license agreements that inhibit independent repairs. \nC. Manufacturers often prefer that customers replace rather than repair the products they own, because every product replacement presents an opportunity for the manufacturer to sell more products and earn more money. Moreover, manufacturers often prefer that customers have products repaired by manufacturers or their authorized repairers rather than by independent repairers or owners so that the manufacturers and authorized repairers can profit off the sale of repair parts and services. These economic incentives can be a driver of repair restrictions. \nD. Manufacturers have offered numerous reasons for restricting independent repairs, including arguing that restrictions are needed to protect their intellectual property, ensure that independent repairers and consumers do not get injured performing repairs, guard against cybersecurity risks, prevent manufacturer liability and reputational harm, provide consumers with the devices and features they desire, and provide quality repair services. \nE. However, in its 2021“Nixing the Fix” Report to Congress, the FTC found scant evidence \nto support any of these professed justifications for repair restrictions. \nF. Expanded competition in repair and parts markets provides numerous benefits for customers and small businesses, including access to timely and less expensive repairs, extending the useable lifespan of products resulting in considerable cost savings to consumers, a significant reduction in electronic waste, and additional economic opportunities for independent repair businesses. \nG. The right to repair a product is a right embodied in the concepts of ownership and personal property. People should have the right to fix products they own using the parts and repair providers of their choosing, as well as the right to fix products themselves. \nH. Repair restrictions can p rovide manufacturers with an unfair advantage over independent \nrepair and parts providers and shift repair dollars away from local businesses, many of which are located in rural communities. \nI. Restrictions on repair tend to fall disproportionately on small businesses and low- income \nhouseholds. Family farms have been particularly impacted by restrictions on the repairability of agricultural equipment. \nJ. Connected “smart” products rely on software or an accompanying app, or both, to connect to the internet to operate. The software or app often needs to be updated to protect the device against security threats and to ensure continued connectivity. If the manufacturer stops providing these updates, the product may lose its “smart” \nfunctionality, become insecure, or completely cease to operate. Thus, the failure to provide software updates can lead to products becoming unrepairable and losing their \n2 \n  \n \n  \n    \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n    \n    \n   \n  advertised functionality. When manufacturers fail to provide updates, customers can lack \nreassurance that that the product they buy today will work tomorrow. \nK. A November 2024 study conducted by FTC staff found that for 89 percent of “smart” products studied, manufacturers failed to disclose on the product webpages how long they would provide software or security updates. This lack of disclosure makes it difficul t, if not impossible, for customers to meaningfully compare product longevity \nwhen shopping for “smart” products. \nL. It advances the public interest to ensure people have ready access to cost -effective repair \nand to products that do not lose functionality when a manufacturer unilaterally decides to cease providing software updates. \nSection 3.
