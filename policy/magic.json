    "body": "Presidential Documents8455 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nExecutive Order 14162 of January 20, 2025 \nPutting America First in International Environmental Agree-\nments \nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: \nSection 1. Purpose. The United States must grow its economy and maintain \njobs for its citizens while playing a leadership role in global efforts to \nprotect the environment. Over decades, with the help of sensible policies that do not encumber private-sector activity, the United States has simulta-neously grown its economy, raised worker wages, increased energy produc-tion, reduced air and water pollution, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The United States’ successful track record of advancing both economic and environmental objectives should be a model for other countries. \nIn recent years, the United States has purported to join international agree-\nments and initiatives that do not reflect our country’s values or our contribu-tions to the pursuit of economic and environmental objectives. Moreover, these agreements steer American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of my Administration to put the interests \nof the United States and the American people first in the development \nand negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy. These agreements must not unduly or unfairly burden the United States. \nSec. 3. Implementation. (a) The United States Ambassador to the United \nNations shall immediately submit formal written notification of the United \nStates’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The notice shall be submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Depositary of the Agree-ment, attached as Appendix A. The United States will consider its withdrawal from the Agreement and any attendant obligations to be effective immediately upon this provision of notification. \n(b) The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall immediately \nsubmit written formal notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, or any relevant party, of the United States’ withdrawal from any agreement, pact, accord, or similar commitment made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n(c) The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collaboration \nwith the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, shall immediately cease or revoke any purported financial commitment made by the United States under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n(d) Immediately upon completion of the tasks listed in subsections (a), \n(b), and (c), the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collabora-tion with the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury shall certify a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that describes in detail any further action required to achieve the policy objectives set forth in section 2 of this order. \n(e) The U.S. International Climate Finance Plan is revoked and rescinded \nimmediately.

General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed \nto impair or otherwise affect: \n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, \nor the head thereof; or \n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. \n(b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable \nlaw and subject to the availability of appropriations. \n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, \nsubstantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party \nagainst the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or any other persons. \nTHE WHITE HOUSE, \nJanuary 20, 2025. \nBilling code 3395–F4–P \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:48 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE1.SGM 30JAE1\nTrump.EPS</GPH>lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC1\n8457 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n[FR Doc. 2025–02010 \nFiled 1–29–25; 8:45 am] \nBilling code 3395–F4–C \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:48 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE1.SGM 30JAE1\nED30JA25.008</GPH> ED30JA25.009</GPH>lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC1APPENDIX A \nNOTIFICATION OF WITHDRAWAL ON BEHALF OF \nTHE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \nNOTIFICATION OF WITHDRAWAL ON BEHALF OF \nTHE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \nHis Excellency Antonio Guterres \nSecretary-General of the United Nations \nI, Donald J.
