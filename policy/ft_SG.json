    "body": "Singapore’s central bank has eased monetary policy for the first time in four years amid rising expectations of trade turmoil after Donald Trump’s return to the US presidency and moderating domestic inflation.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore on Friday said it would slow the rate of the Singapore dollar’s appreciation against a basket of its trading partners’ currencies, citing anticipations of trade friction.\n\n“Global economic policy uncertainty has risen since the October monetary policy review, mainly reflecting expectations of increasing trade policy frictions,” the MAS said in a statement, adding that global growth could slow in 2025.\n\nUnlike most central banks, the MAS does not use domestic interest rates to set monetary policy. Instead, it has a long-term policy of allowing the Singapore dollar to gradually appreciate against other currencies.\n\nBy reducing the slope of its appreciation, the monetary authority in effect lowers borrowing rates in the city-state’s heavily trade-dependent economy.\n\nThe move — the first time the MAS has loosened policy since the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020 — came after inflation data released on Thursday showed the city-state’s core consumer price index rose 1.8 per cent in December from a year earlier, the second consecutive month of growth below 2 per cent.\n\nThe central bank also lowered its inflation forecast for 2025 to between 1 and 2 per cent, down from 1.5 to 2.5 per cent in October. Although the MAS does not set a hard inflation target, it has said a rate under 2 per cent “is consistent with overall price stability”.\n\nSingapore’s small and open economy is highly exposed to global trade and financial flows, allowing the MAS to control lending rates through the exchange rate. According to the central bank, 40 cents of every dollar spent in Singapore is on imports, while gross imports and exports of goods and services account for more than 300 per cent of GDP.\n\nThe MAS sets a policy band for its foreign exchange rate, though it does not disclose the exact levels.\n\nIt adjusts the slope, level and width of the band to control the pace and volatility of currency moves, allowing the Singapore dollar to strengthen or weaken against the currencies of its biggest trading partners.\n\nThe MAS also said on Friday that Singapore’s GDP growth was expected to drop from 4 per cent in 2024 to between 1 and 3 per cent this year.\n\n“Overall, the outlook for Singapore’s growth and thus inflation remains subject to uncertainties in the external environment,” said the central bank.\n\nThe Singapore dollar edged down in early trading on Friday before reversing course to trade at S$1.3526 per US dollar.",

    "date": "2025-01-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "TikTok parent ByteDance is asking Chinese staff at its Singapore headquarters to pay tax to their home country or risk losing their ability to cash out on stock options, as Beijing steps up enforcement of its global tax scheme.\n\nEmployees at ByteDance who relocated from China to Singapore received an internal memo on Tuesday requiring them to report their income to Chinese tax authorities and pay relevant taxes to cash out on stock options that make up a significant portion of their pay, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThose hired locally with Chinese citizenship were encouraged to report their income but not required to do so, according to the people. More than 1,000 employees could be affected, and the tax difference could be as high as 21 percentage points depending on individual salaries, as both countries have a tiered tax structure.\n\nSingapore has emerged as a regional hub for many Chinese companies looking to expand into south-east Asia and globally. Tech giants Alibaba, Tencent and PDD, as well as start-ups such as Shein, have set up offices in the city-state, where lower tax rates have convinced many Chinese workers to relocate.\n\nChina in recent years has increased efforts to collect tax revenue to fill government coffers, including demanding wealthy individuals and companies double-check for unpaid liabilities, amid a broad economic slowdown.\n\nIn 2019, Beijing revised its income tax rules to allow authorities to collect revenue from Chinese expats, similar to US rules on Americans living abroad, but it has not enforced them rigorously. Most Chinese citizens working abroad only need to report their taxable income on a voluntary basis, and Beijing has not outlined consequences for those who do not.\n\nFor higher-paid workers at ByteDance, the potential difference could be massive. The highest marginal tax rate in mainland China is 45 per cent, while the top rate in Singapore and Hong Kong, cities with significant Chinese expat populations, is 24 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively.\n\nMany ByteDance employees receive part of their remuneration in restricted stock units that are typically vested over a number of years and then purchased by the company. A recent share buyback in November valued ByteDance at $300bn.\n\nA person familiar with the matter said employees required to pay tax would need to show proof of payment to fully participate in the buyback, while any amount of tax owed would be held by the company in equivalent restricted stock units.\n\nThe person added that ByteDance would provide subsidies to affected employees for up to two years but did not specify if they would be enough to bridge the gap.\n\nByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "date": "2025-01-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "As tensions ratchet up between two of Malaysia’s biggest trading partners, the US and China, the south-east Asian nation is increasingly looking to hitch its wagon to its more successful neighbour, Singapore.\n\nA special economic zone straddling the two countries — along with a raft of initiatives to build stronger ties — has been designed to help the pair withstand tougher global economic trading conditions.\n\n“We are entering a new era where global tensions are here to stay,” warned Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong this month at the signing of an agreement to create the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone. “The world is becoming a more dangerous and troubled place. This is not going to go away in the near term.”\n\nStanding at his side, his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim added: “We have to strengthen ourselves as a regional force to be able to withstand the unpredictable pressures from other areas or groups or regions.”\n\nMalaysia’s closer ties to Singapore are part of a broader push by the former to use its chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year to forge stronger links with its nearest neighbours, as global trade networks become increasingly balkanised.\n\n“[Trade wars] could create opportunities for Asean,” Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour, Malaysia’s central bank governor, told the Financial Times, though he conceded that global growth would be harmed by increased protectionism.\n\nThe two countries have not always been close. It has been 60 years since Malaysia expelled Singapore from its federation, forcing the latter into independence as a city-state amid racial tensions and political clashes between both sides.\n\nFor most of the past six decades, the two countries have viewed each other with suspicion and been locked in a deep rivalry, one in which Singapore, Malaysia’s biggest trading partner, has been the clear victor. It has established itself as a global trading and finance hub, with GDP a head of $94,000 compared with Malaysia’s $14,400.\n\nBut Donald Trump’s return to the White House this week, his promise to implement a spate of tariffs and a slowing Chinese economy have made Malaysia and Singapore look to strengthen ties.\n\n“Generations of Malaysian and Singaporean leaders had to manage [this rivalry] and that stopped us from doing what is common sense to everyone, which is to integrate Singapore and Johor better,” Malaysian economy minister Rafizi Ramli told the FT, referring to the Malaysian state bordering Singapore. “Operating as nearly an economic unit will offer investors the best of both worlds.”\n\nModelled on China’s Shenzhen special economic zone, which borders Hong Kong, but is twice its size, the JSSEZ is central to Malaysia’s ambitions to build on its 5 per cent economic growth last year.\n\nMalaysia has already positioned its economy to play a key role in the global demand for artificial intelligence, from developing one of Asia’s biggest semiconductor hubs in the northern island of Penang over several decades, to more recently welcoming big tech companies to set up data centres in the south.\n\nIt has also benefited from “China plus one”, a strategy in which multinational companies complement their Chinese operations with investments in regional countries to diversify risk and lower costs.\n\nThe government hopes the JSSEZ will add $26bn a year to its economy by 2030, bringing in 20,000 skilled jobs and 50 new projects.\n\nIt has offered generous corporate tax rates of just 5 per cent for 15 years for companies investing in areas such as AI and quantum computing, as well as manufacturing high-end equipment. That compares with typical rates of 15-24 per cent in Malaysia and lows of 17 per cent in Singapore.\n\nJohor has already been a critical engine for the Malaysian economy in recent years, thanks in part to its pro-business sultan becoming the country’s king a year ago.\n\nThe state has emerged as a global hub for data centres, drawing in more than $25bn of investment from the likes of Nvidia, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance and creating 35,000 jobs.\n\nWhile Johor provides plenty of cheap land, water, energy and labour to develop the projects, Singapore offers an entry point for investors.\n\n“Conceptually [the special economic zone] has the ability to leverage Singapore’s global finance and logistics centre capabilities with Johor’s access to competitive land, labour and energy to deliver a differentiated proposition — especially for supply chains looking for alternatives to north Asia amid the US-China trade war,” said Maybank analyst Thilan Wickramasinghe.\n\nBut it is not just big tech companies the JSSEZ is aimed at attracting. Johor also hopes to draw everything from Singaporean banks setting up administrative offices to aerospace, electronics and pharmaceutical companies building manufacturing bases.\n\nThe two neighbours have talked about closer collaborations on a range of areas, including cross-border electricity trading, digitalisation, infrastructure projects and green energy. There are also plans to improve transport links across the strait separating the two countries, one of the busiest borders in the world.\n\n“How does a small, non-aligned trading nation like Malaysia wade its way through trade wars and geopolitical tension?” said Rafizi. “There’s only one option for countries like ourselves and Singapore: we collaborate better with each other and harness our synergy.”",

    "blurb": "Government fund’s bet on BeZero is the latest in a series of investments in carbon credit companies",
    "date": "2025-01-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Welcome back. I had a terrific evening yesterday at a London production of Kyoto, a new play that brings to life the first decade of international climate negotiations — and the oil industry machinations that sought to undermine them. It’s a fast-paced, innovative staging that conveys the raw intensity of climate diplomacy, and the tremendously high stakes involved. Don’t take my word for it: here’s the lowdown from the FT’s theatre critic.\n\nOne of the key flashpoints in the play is the intense argument at the 1997 Kyoto summit over carbon offset trading. Almost three decades on, the controversy around carbon markets has only grown. But as we highlight in today’s newsletter, some investors are still seeing opportunities in the troubled sector.\n\nReports of the death of the voluntary carbon market may yet prove exaggerated. The $32mn funding round announced yesterday by London-based carbon credit rating agency BeZero Carbon would be seen as small beer in some industries. But for the carbon credit sector, battered over the past two years by a reputational crisis and a fundraising drought, it looks like a noteworthy shot in the arm.\n\nBeZero’s fundraising provides fresh evidence of the outsized role that Singapore has taken in the carbon credit market. The lead investor is GenZero, launched in 2022 with $3.6bn of committed capital from Temasek, Singapore’s $288bn sovereign wealth fund.\n\nFrom the start, GenZero has had a mandate to invest in promoting carbon market development as one of its three core focus areas — alongside the related field of nature-based projects, and broader climate technology. “We think the journey towards net zero will be impossible without effective carbon markets,” chief executive Frederick Teo told me.\n\nTeo said the investment in BeZero reflected the need for transparent and reliable data that would allow buyers to identify high-quality credits and regain confidence in the market. Transaction value in the voluntary carbon market fell from $2.1bn in 2021 to $723mn in 2023, according to Ecosystem Marketplace. Separate data from MSCI shows that volumes and prices remained depressed last year. Corporate buyers have taken fright at media and academic allegations that many projects have hugely exaggerated their carbon benefits.\n\nTommy Ricketts, BeZero’s chief executive, said the company had about 150 clients for its credit ratings and broader market data, assembled by a full-time employee base that included 77 scientists. Ricketts added that, given BeZero’s leading role in ratings and the industry’s growing emphasis on transparency, an investment in BeZero amounted to “a leveraged play” on the future growth of the carbon market.\n\n“It’s just about waiting for that inflection, that catalyst, whatever it may be,” Ricketts said.\n\nWill that wait pay off? If this market does return to growth, Singapore will deserve a share of the credit. Singaporean companies can now use carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their liabilities under its national carbon tax regime. That tax currently stands at about S$25 ($18.30) a tonne — a quarter of the price under the EU’s emissions trading scheme — but is set to rise significantly in the next few years.\n\nThis means that, unlike most other governments, Singapore has given its companies a real economic incentive to invest in carbon credits. It’s taken a fairly careful approach on which sorts of credits can be used, setting out minimum standards and forming agreements with individual countries on the use of projects in their jurisdictions.\n\nAll this, Ricketts argued, was part of a push by Singapore to become “the hub of carbon” — a bet that, despite its current travails, the carbon credit market could become one of real economic significance, and that this entrepreneurial city-state could become its global centre of gravity.\n\nIf that is indeed the strategy, GenZero appears to be its financial spearhead. The fund has made a series of investments in carbon credit companies — notably in Climate Impact X, a Singapore-based carbon marketplace. Other investments have included South Pole, one of the largest carbon credit consultancies, and Perennial, which uses machine learning and remote sensing to assess the carbon impact of soil projects.\n\nAll these companies have been affected by the headwinds assailing the sector — notably South Pole, which has been embroiled in some of the more high-profile controversies over project quality.\n\nBut Teo — along with GenZero’s financial backer, the Singaporean government — is betting that a turnaround in the market will come in due course. The integration of carbon credits in mandatory carbon pricing schemes, as pioneered by Singapore, is one potential driver of demand. Another is a major change in the international rules for airlines: from 2027, nearly all of them will be required to buy carbon credits unless they achieve big emission reductions.\n\nThen there is the long-awaited international carbon trading mechanism that was promised in the text of the 2015 Paris Agreement. At November’s COP29 in Baku, a basic agreement on what credits could be used in this mechanism was hailed by some as a breakthrough, though there remains a huge amount of work to do before that system will be up and running.\n\nAll this may sound far too optimistic to the many who see the voluntary carbon market as a busted flush. And unless the market can address the serious concerns that have been raised around quality and integrity , it is highly questionable whether its growth will be beneficial to the global struggle against climate change.\n\nBut Singapore clearly thinks this sector is worth a punt, albeit a fairly modest one by the standards of the huge sums deployed by its sovereign investment funds. It’s also an opportunity to strengthen its ties with developing nations around the world, which are home to the bulk of carbon credit projects.\n\nWith the clear mandate and stable funding that he’s been given by the government, Teo is able to be far more patient than most investors in this space. “We’re taking a constructive view of carbon markets for the long term,” he told me. “It would be naive to imagine things will be hunky-dory in 2025 or 2026.”\n\nNew era How will sustainable investing survive the return of Donald Trump?\n\nExpensive medicine EU pollution rules could force European carmakers to pay large sums to Chinese rivals for carbon credits.\n\nDamage limitation Reinsurance companies may absorb less than 3 per cent of insured losses from the Los Angeles fires, having cut their risk exposure in recent years.",

    "date": "2025-01-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "A British activist investor has appealed to Singapore’s markets regulator to intervene in the takeover of an insurer by the city-state’s second-biggest bank, calling the deal “gravely unfair” for shareholders.\n\nThe move by Palliser Capital, which has taken on several high-profile companies since its founders broke away from Elliott four years ago, is the latest in a wave of activist campaigns in Asia in the past year.\n\nThere were 57 campaigns against Asian companies in 2024, up from a previous record of 44 the year before, according to Lazard, with Japanese groups Sumitomo Corporation, SoftBank and Nissan all being targeted in the past six months.\n\nGreat Eastern is Singapore’s oldest and largest life insurer. Palliser, which has a stake in Great Eastern, has accused OCBC of treating minority shareholders unfairly in its attempted full takeover of the company.\n\nIn letters sent to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and SGX stock exchange, seen by the Financial Times, the activist accused the Great Eastern board of being “highly complacent” in recommending the offer.\n\nIt added that the insurer’s “corporate governance safeguards designed to protect the interests of minority shareholders were lacking or insufficiently robust”.\n\nIn response, the MAS and SGX told Palliser they were monitoring the case and engaging with both sides, according to communications seen by the FT.\n\nGreat Eastern, which has more than S$100bn (US$73bn) in assets and 16mn policyholders in Singapore and Malaysia, has been part-owned by OCBC since 1958. A minority of shares, about 6 per cent, are listed on Singapore’s stock exchange.\n\nIn 2008, OCBC increased its stake in the insurer to 87 per cent and announced a voluntary offer in May last year to take full control of the business for S$1.4bn, or S$25.60 a share, a 37 per cent premium on the share price at the time.\n\nEY provided a valuation to the insurer, which put it at a range of S$28.87 to S$36.19 a share, though Palliser believes it should be higher.\n\nThe activist argued that senior Great Eastern executives and board members — several of whom are former OCBC executives — had conflicts of interest because they received a large proportion of their pay in the bank’s stock and therefore benefited from a lower offer price.\n\nPalliser complained to the MAS about the Great Eastern board’s refusal to meet the activist investor over the issue.\n\n“Great Eastern’s seeming unwillingness to engage with us in any meaningful sense has added to our sense of unease and frustration and made us determined to ensure that the interests of Great Eastern’s remaining minority shareholders are safeguarded,” the investor wrote.\n\nForeign activist forays are relatively rare in Singapore, which prides itself on being a business-friendly financial hub. But several recent cases have led to Swiss and Australian activists pushing for better deals for minority shareholders in takeover deals.\n\nMany of the campaigns against Asian companies are focused on breaking up multi-industry conglomerates, with Asia-Pacific catching up with Europe as the second most active region behind the US.\n\nAmong Palliser’s recent campaigns are a move to force Rio Tinto to abandon its primary London listing and consolidate its Australian business, as well as pushing for change at a Japanese property company and a rail operator with a stake in Tokyo Disneyland’s owner.\n\nPalliser, OCBC, the MAS and SGX declined to comment on the Great Eastern campaign. Great Eastern did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis article has been amended since publication to correct the percentage of listed shares in Great Eastern and to clarify that EY provided the valuation to the insurer, not to Palliser Capital",

    "date": "2024-12-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "The number of companies listed on Singapore’s stock exchange has hit a two-decade low after just four companies went public this year and several delisted, with the city-state’s regulator investigating how to halt the equity market’s slide.\n\nThe number of companies on the Singapore Exchange fell to 617 in October, the lowest since September 2004. The figure has been in steady decline since hitting a high of 782 in 2013, with domestic companies attracted to overseas listings, especially in larger and more heavily traded markets such as the US.\n\n“I surely hope that this year is a low point,” said Clifford Lee, head of the investment bank at DBS, south-east Asia’s biggest lender and Singapore’s most valuable public company. “It’s a result of various factors coming together.”\n\nShein, the Chinese fast-fashion business based in Singapore since 2022, is considering a London listing with a potential £50bn market valuation, which would make it one of the UK’s largest public companies. Several of Singapore’s best-known businesses, including superapp Grab and ecommerce group Sea, have opted for New York listings in recent years.\n\nSingapore has benefited from a flood of private capital flowing into the city-state, which has coincided with a burgeoning family office sector, while the SGX has also built up strong bond trading, derivatives and real estate investment trust markets. But it has struggled to repeat that growth with initial public offerings.\n\nOver the summer, the Monetary Authority of Singapore launched a review of the country’s equity markets, with a panel that included the heads of the SGX, monetary authority and Temasek, the state-owned investment company.\n\nThe group is due to report its findings next August and has so far discussed ways of attracting more fund managers to invest in the stock market in order to address demand issues, while relaxing some disclosure rules and investor safeguards to encourage more companies to list, according to a person involved in the talks.\n\n“It’s a chicken and an egg situation,” the person said. “We have to make it attractive for good companies to list and see more fund managers in the market, and they will only be attracted by the prospect of investing in good companies.”\n\nThe regulator said in a statement: “Many ideas have been surfaced as the review group is engaging broadly with many groups of stakeholders and the review group discussions are still ongoing.”\n\nSeveral investment bankers told the Financial Times that 2024 was likely to be the nadir for listings in Singapore due to the political uncertainty of general elections around the world. They said there was pent-up demand, and they were working on several IPOs for next year.\n\nThe four companies that went public with a primary listing on the SGX this year — all of which were on the junior Catalist market — had a combined IPO value of just $31mn and included a chain of karaoke bars and an operator of Japanese restaurants.\n\nThe largest company to list, the Singapore Institute of Advanced Medicine healthcare group, has shed 71 per cent of its market value since its March IPO after reporting heavy losses. Its auditor, PwC, raised questions about its ability to continue as a going concern over the summer.\n\nStock markets around the world — notably London — have struggled to attract listings in the face of fierce competition and high valuations in the US. The amount raised through IPOs across south-east Asia this year is the lowest in at least 10 years, according to Dealogic.\n\nEven so, Malaysia has had 46 IPOs this year, compared with 39 in Indonesia and 28 in Thailand. While the Philippines had just three listings, their total value of $197mn far outpaced Singapore’s $31mn.\n\nMost of the companies that listed in other south-east Asian markets were domestic, whereas Singapore is positioning itself as a global hub for international public companies.\n\n“The strategic infrastructure is here, the liquidity available in the market to invest in new listings is here,” said DBS’s Lee, who is involved in the MAS review. “Now we need a good supply of companies choosing to list. We have a healthy pipeline for the year ahead. It’s like a well-oiled, sleek machine that hasn’t been used.”\n\nOne option often mooted is whether to allow Singapore’s compulsory savings system — the Central Provident Fund, typically used to finance retirement, healthcare and property purchases — to invest more in the domestic stock market.\n\n“That would create new pools of money to help drive up multiples and would probably spark IPOs,” said Jayden Vantarakis, head of south-east Asian equities research at Macquarie, who covers the SGX.\n\nBut he doubts that such reforms will materialise and downgraded the SGX from “outperform” to “neutral” in November, partly on expectations that the MAS review would fail to prevent the decline in listings.\n\nAdditional reporting by Haohsiang Ko in Hong Kong",

    "body": "A flurry of new exchange traded funds are set to be added to the master-feeder scheme linking Singapore and Chinese exchanges that has seen slow take-up since its launch at the end of 2021.\n\nFund firms in the two markets have faced difficulties in agreeing commercial partnerships and China’s slumping markets have also slowed the product pipeline for the scheme, which allows investors access to ETFs cross-listed between the Singapore, Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses.\n\nBut while only seven ETFs have been launched on the scheme up to end-November, including partnerships between UOB Asset Management and Ping An Fund Management, and CSOP Asset Management and PineBridge Investments, a turnaround could be on the cards.\n\nEarlier this month, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said it was in discussions with its Chinese counterpart to expand the number of ETFs on the cross-listing scheme.\n\nRussell Wang, head of securitised products for global markets at the Singapore Exchange, said the expectation of further government reforms and a rebound in China’s onshore markets meant ETF issuers were now preparing more products to be rolled out next year.\n\n“Before September, weak investor sentiment towards Chinese equities slowed down developments in the pipeline as issuers were less certain about demand for new ETF listings,” said Wang.\n\nBut since the Chinese stock market rallied in October, investors had been getting back into the market, showing greater appetite for investing offshore, and issuers were responding and preparing to meet this change in demand, Wang said.\n\nWang now expects three to four new ETFs to be added to the cross-link scheme in the first half of 2025.\n\nThis is in addition to a new emerging Asia ETF from Singapore’s Lion Global Investors and Shenzhen-based China Merchants Fund Management that will be listed on December 11.\n\nBefore the Lion Global and China Merchants ETF, the last fund to be launched as part of the scheme was a Phillip Capital and China Universal Asset Management ETF that was rolled out in March.\n\nThis boost in investor appetite has also translated to an uptick in flows for ETFs available on the Singapore-China link.\n\nAssets in the scheme grew by S$24mn ($17.9mn) in September and October, accounting for nearly 80 per cent of total asset growth in the preceding 12 months, according to the SGX.\n\nChinese investors accounted for 70 per cent of total flows, indicating interest among onshore investors for Singapore-listed ETFs.\n\nWang expects that overall Chinese investor sentiment is likely to pick up if the Chinese government is more proactive in supporting the market in light of Donald Trump’s election victory in the US.\n\nWing Chan, head of manager research for Asia Pacific at Morningstar, said Chinese domestic investors still had untapped demand for wider offshore exposure, which the Singapore-China ETF link could provide.\n\nHistorically, much of the offshore access has been via Hong Kong channels and Hong Kong products, he said, but many of these actually still invest in Chinese assets.\n\nIn addition to market performance factors, misalignment between partner fund firms in the scheme, particularly around commercial terms, has been a key reason behind the heretofore slow uptake in the scheme.\n\n“For many of the issuers, they have limited experience working on a partnership with a Chinese asset manager, and vice versa,” said SGX’s Wang.\n\nThe part that took up the most time was usually around the “bilateral discussion to agree on the commercial terms”, such as who would drive fundraising and flows, and the overall objective of the partnership, he noted.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

    "body": "Opened in 1916 in a spectacular cast-iron structure near Plaza Mayor, this gourmet market is a celebration of the Spanish larder, with more than 30 stalls offering a range of produce, from Galicia’s famed fresh fish and seafood, to olives, cheese, cured meats and top-notch tapas. It’s worth popping in if only to perch at one of its wine bars with a glass of cava and a plate of boquerones. It’s chaos, but that is part of this mercado’s (and Madrid’s) charm. Niki Blasina\n\nFounded during the Arab domination of Sicily, Mercato del Capo remains one of the more multicultural corners of the city. Here you can find Nigerian textile traders rubbing shoulders with burly fishmongers expertly filleting tunas, or sample myriad olives and cheeses from the island’s hinterland. My grandfather taught me to come early, and make a beeline for the cart selling steaming slices of sfincione (a focaccia-like bread served with oregano, anchovies and caciocavallo cheese). Ben Marino\n\nInspired by the designs of one of the city’s most famous sons, Gustave Eiffel, this Dijon market is a vaulted, ironwork theatre of Burgundian gastronomy. Four days a week, Les Halles hums with local producers selling Charolais beef for the classic bœuf à la bourguignonne, giant wheels of Comté cheese from the nearby Jura, as well as the wines, more cheeses, chickens, mushrooms, snails and mustards for which the region is famed. John Thornhill\n\nChapel Market is part of my life, my identity. It’s always felt under threat but never died – it really is the place where everyone knows your name. It is where you go for last glimpses of a mixed London community with some good veg and excellent chat. Now there is a farmers’ market too, but it’s the old-fashioned “normal” market that gives me the most joy and the avocados I can actually afford. Juliet Riddell\n\nFor more than a century, Grand Central Market in Los Angeles’s downtown historic district has celebrated the city’s many food cultures under one roof. While legacy vendors such as China Cafe (c1959), best known for its huge bowls of wonton soup and off-menu egg rolls, reign on, in recent years a host of new businesses has been welcomed into the fold, from Lucky Bird, the market’s first and only stall dedicated to fried chicken and its accoutrements (read: waffles dripping in syrup) to award-winning smashburgers at For The Win. Not to be missed: the all-day breakfast burritos at Jose Chiquito. Inès Cross\n\nOne of this famously gastronomic city’s largest markets opened in 1859 and was renamed after the late chef Paul Bocuse, a native son, in 2006 following a total renovation. Today it covers three floors with more than 13,500sq m, and is home to 54 stalls and restaurants. Don’t miss Mons fromager, one of the best cheesemongers in France; Patisserie Seve for a sticky pink tarte aux pralines; and Bobosse for Lyonnais charcuterie like plump pistachio-studded fresh sausage. Great eats on the spot include Baba La Grenouille for frogs’ legs en persillade and Chez Les Gones for local comfort food like quenelles de brochet (pike dumplings). Alexander Lobrano\n\nAt this, one of the biggest food markets in Europe, more than 1,200 stalls sell everything from fresh fruit, meat, cheese and live eels. Forage for a picnic lunch, admire the stained-glass windows or spend the afternoon sipping cold beer and eating a loin sandwich at Richard Camarena’s Central Bar. Sally Hickey\n\n“Peaceful” is the last word most would use to describe Singapore’s hawker markets. That’s why locals often skip the more famous ones in the central area for East Coast Lagoon Food Village, in one of the city-state’s largest beach parks. There you can find food-market staples including satay, sugar-cane juice and Hainanese chicken rice, plus seafood specialities such as chilli crab and fried oysters, all served with ocean views. Taylor Nicole Rogers\n\nDubbed the chicest market in Paris by Le Figaro, this lively open-air market is popular with Parisian chefs for the exceptional quality of stands such as Le Bar à Patates, which specialises in potatoes, mushrooms and fresh herbs, and La Bergerie du Mesnil, run by Sandy Brown McKeen, an Irish farmer who lives in Normandy and produces exceptional yoghurt, cream, milk, and meat. La Maison Priolet is also renowned for its game and high-quality poultry. A variety of food stands serve food to eat on the hoof, such as grilled Lebanese bread and Breton crêpes, plus juicy rotisserie chickens that make for a great picnic or fast meal in a holiday flat. AL\n\nUnder the deep shade of century-old plane trees, dotted across the central town square, market traders from surrounding villages sell local produce. Bellows cheese made in an identical way since the 14th century, renowned Herzegovinian wine, honey, medicinal herbs and prosciutto are just a few of the delights on offer. After food tasting and shopping, visitors sit in the cafés on the square to cool down with a lemonade and enjoy people-watching. Tatjana Mitevska\n\nTsukiji has got everything, from unctuous otoro to the ethically questionable (but legal) whale skewers. Try a hearty bowl of beef intestine and miso stew at Kitsuneya. Then head to Iroha for mochi topped with giant strawberries, especially if the Amaou variety is in season. For post-prandial coffee, grab a cup of City Blend at John Lennon’s go-to shop Yonemoto. Kristine Ching\n\nWith more than 200 vendors selling everything from passion fruit to poke bowls, this indoor-outdoor market is a vibrant must-experience on Hawaii’s Big Island. With special sections for tropical plants (orchids and anthuriums are abundant), macadamia nuts and artisanal oils, as well as colourful sarongs and hand-carved wooden accessories, this is a one-stop-shop. Be sure to sample the fruits of the season – white pineapples, thimble berries, strawberry papayas, guavas – and the local Kona coffee, preferably on Wednesdays and Saturdays when the market is particularly popping. Christina Ohly Evans\n\nThe glass-walled market hall in the centre of town offers a taste of Copenhagen’s culinary prowess. Both a food market and an incubator for chefs, Torvehallerne is home to more than 60 restaurant stalls and purveyors of artisanal food and drink, flowers, plants and kitchen tools. Danish specialities are plenty: rows of smørrebrød with kaleidoscopic toppings, artfully folded pastries and dense rye breads. Cuisines from around the world are also well represented, from Spanish tapas to Mexican tacos to Chinese crêpes. Though on a cold day, it’s the fresh pasta at Il Mattarello that really makes my heart sing. NB\n\nNîmes’ elegant 19th-century glass-and-steel market pavilion was replaced by a modern cement structure in the 1970s, but this did nothing to dent the passion of the food-loving Nîmois. Visit Nadal, a century-old coffee roaster; Les Fromages de Sylvain, for his excellent selection of cheeses and wonderful sense of humour; and the new stall selling brandade de Nîmes, the creamy garlicky salt-cod preparation that’s the city’s best-known dish. Plan on lunch at La Pie Qui Couette, a counter-seating, lunch-only restaurant that’s hugely popular for its cuisine du marché menu, but get there early. AL\n\nTucked away in one corner of the old stone town, this small market offers an unusual mix of high-quality continental and Mediterranean food. Located at the entry of Montenegro Boka Bay, it is supplied by tropical fruit grown in villages on the coast, such as fortunela, oranges, pomegranate, lemons and kiwis, as well as fresh seafood. Farmers from villages in the mountains surrounding the town bring traditional authentic produce such as the renowned prosciutto from Njeguši, potatoes from Kruševice, goat’s cheese, wild asparagus and wild garlic. TM\n\nThis is in my hometown, and it certainly beats more renowned markets like La Boqueria. It’s a combination of great food stalls, particularly Asian, veggie shopping for the ordinary person and lot of foodie-type stalls. It’s a tale of a market that can provide a focus for a city and enrich it – and a tale of the integration of the various tides of immigrants from Italy and Greece in the postwar period, Vietnamese, Cambodians and Lebanese in the 1970s and ’80s and Chinese and Indians more recently. Tony Tassell\n\nWest Philadelphia converges with Pennsylvania’s yeoman tradition at the Clark Park Farmers’ Market. Every Saturday, Amish farmers hawk their produce across from West Philly and East Kensington businesses selling pound cakes or seafood. One can enjoy new Philadelphia favourites Nilaa Coffee, Aaji’s Kitchen or Lost Bread or just as easily buy preserves and cheese from a family-owned farm, in a space that is testament to Philadelphia’s shifting yet venerable culinary scene. Aiden Reiter\n\nThis is the largest and cheapest market in the city, with its home in the garden of the Gundulić summer villa. Locals come early in the morning to buy fresh fish straight off the boats from the Elafiti islands. Farmers from Dubrovnik’s Konavle suburb sell a wide selection of their organic produce here throughout the day. Traditional local delicacies such as dried figs, candied orange peel, extra-virgin olive oil and quince jelly are also available as souvenirs for visitors. TM\n\nThis is the most popular and the best-stocked food market in the Serbian capital. Located in Vračar in the heart of the city, it is named after Vlajko Kalenić, who donated the land on which it was built almost a century ago. A vast variety of produce, from home-distilled brandy rakija, kaymak cheese and fruit and vegetables to cured meats and spices, is on display on stalls where sellers and buyers haggle, joke and even sing. Many locals tell me they change their walking routes just to enjoy the splendid site of colourful stalls full of fragrant produce. TM\n\nDescribed by the preeminent Breton chef Olivier Roellinger as “the best larder in Brittany”, the second-largest food market in France was founded in 1622. Some 300 stalls sell everything from seafood landed only hours earlier to Roscoff onions, big snowy cauliflowers, dozens of apple varieties, honey and other foods that comprise what Roellinger describes as “the Celtic diet”. Treat yourself to a grilled pork sausage rolled up in a hot buckwheat galette, the city’s favourite market snack, to fortify yourself before shopping. AL\n\nThe largest market of its kind in the southern hemisphere is a cornerstone of Australia’s gourmet tourist trade, with a vast array of fresh fish and seafood on show – including oddities like blood cockles and Moreton Bay Bugs – and sushi, oysters, fish and chips and lobsters served on site. The famous blue-coloured market building, located in Pyrmont to the west of the centre of the city, is set to move next year but only by a few hundred metres into a new purpose-built facility. Nic Fildes\n\nEvery Saturday in Athens, the historic anarchist district of Exarchia hosts a farmers’ market, which runs along Kallidromiou under the famous graffitied steps. Musicians play traditional Greek music as sellers flaunt their wares: olive oil, honey and an assortment of fresh fish, herbs and vegetables. While Exarchia has been gentrified over the past few decades, and police tensions have amplified since the building of a new metro station nearby, the market remains a touchstone in the neighbourhood: a place where students, anarchists, artists and academics meld with tourists. Lucinda Smyth\n\nThis bustling Old Delhi bazaar is a maze of streets and narrow alleys, with the iconic Red Fort at its eastern end. Enormous piles of cardamom and cloves, dried fruit and nuts, Kashmiri saffron and every imaginable street food – curries, roti, samosas and kebabs – send smells wafting through the thick air. Of special note are the stalls offering sweets including mango-stuffed kulfi, crispy fried jalebi and Karachi halwa. COE\n\nA favourite of Mexico City chefs, Mercado San Juan is packed with every ingredient you might need, and plenty you don’t. Stalls in the downtown market sell everything from pitaya, clams and cacao fruit to dozens of varieties of chilies. It’s also a frequent stop for food-tour groups ogling a selection of more exotic choices, including an array of protein-packed scorpions and crocodile meat. For the less adventurous, there are plenty of wine and cheese options. Christine Murray\n\nThe aroma of frying doughnuts and brewing coffee wafts over the market as tourists and locals alike pick through acres of fresh fruit and vegetable stands. The bustling meat, seafood and cheese halls are chock-a-block with people trying tastes of Australian and farther-flung specialities. Officially opened in 1878, the “Queen Vic” draws 10 million visitors annually. More than 600 food and non-food stalls are open five days a week, and there’s a weekly night market focusing on street food, live entertainment and crafts. Brooke Masters\n\nThe 1890s Liberty-style market of the Tuscan port city of Livorno is a vibrant and down-to-earth place to savour torta di ceci (chickpea flour flatbread), fresh oysters shucked on the spot or acciughe alla povera (fresh marinated anchovies). Visit speciality food shops (one is devoted entirely to prized Livornese hens’ eggs), then ogle the stalls showing off the Ligurian Sea’s bounty while you plan dinner – the earlier you arrive, the better. Emiko Davies\n\nFor anyone with a serious sweet tooth, this sprawling, sugar-filled mega-market is worth a detour. Start a market tour with the local delicacy ate (ah-tay) – slow-cooked guava, pear and quince that are served in jellied, chilli-powder-dusted cubes and chunks of crystallised pineapple and pumpkin. Morelianas, one of the most iconic candies, are rich caramel discs that are found next to chocolate balls and jars of cajeta, a favoured spread for breads or served over ice cream. COE\n\nThe Ningxia Night Market is relatively small compared to the island’s other sprawling competitors, but it is mighty. Its oyster omelette shop is famous and well worth a visit, but if you want to avoid the queues, there are plenty of other treats to indulge in. Seek out the deep-fried taro balls, stinky tofu and the unsung hero of desserts: the ice-cream wrap with peanut candy shavings and coriander. Go hungry, leave full. Eleanor Olcott\n\nThousands of eateries comprise this sprawling soul-food mecca, offering everything from kimchi dumplings to steaming bowls of bibimbap and noodles that are perfect for slurping, grilled meat and mung-bean pancakes. Pull up a plastic stool in the food court and absorb the energy of the many hawkers – and a sea of voracious eaters savouring local delicacies. The market features an area dedicated to clothing and home goods as well, and it’s the ideal place to buy an exquisite silk hanbok (traditional Korean dress). COE\n\nA highlight of the New York summer is the Queens Night Market, a nocturnal festival attracting more than 60 independent food and art vendors. Located in Flushing, it begins in April, and continues until October. From early evening until midnight, visitors can sample street food from across the globe, and unlike many glossy food-stall markets, the food vendor prices are capped at $6. Check out the Trinidadian bake and shark from Caribbean Street Eats or curry crab at Trini Treats, or the arepa sampler at Arepalicious. Madison Darbyshire\n\nA stroll down the Mercado 20 de Noviembre’s “smoke corridor” is an immersive experience. The market itself is famed for stalls selling tlayudas – giant, crispy tortillas with beans, local cheese, and other toppings. In its dark, sweltering smoke passage, sellers display an assortment of meats they will chargrill and put into a tortilla for you. A word of warning: you might take the smell with you. CM",

    "blurb": "Long jail sentence for 82-year-old former oil trader is sign of ‘zero tolerance’ for fraud",
    "date": "2024-12-0300:00:00.0",
    "body": "After a series of scandals at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Singapore’s efforts to rein in its commodity trading sector have culminated in a lengthy prison sentence for a former oil trader now in his 80s.\n\nLim Oon Kuin — known as OK Lim, and once one of Singapore’s richest men — was found guilty in May of defrauding HSBC and abetting forgery. The 82-year-old was sentenced in November to 17 and a half years in jail in a ruling the judge said was designed to act as a “deterrent”. Lim’s defence lawyer has appealed, citing his wheelchair-bound client’s age and poor health.\n\nThe tough sentencing exemplifies how Singapore has tried to crack down on dodgy dealing in its commodities market. It has launched initiatives aimed at digitising the documentation that is the backbone of the commodities market, while encouraging wider information sharing among market players to prevent fraud.\n\n“Singapore has realised they need to step up and rebuild some credibility,” said Jean-François Lambert, founding partner of Lambert Commodities, a consultancy. “They are taking these scandals more seriously.”\n\nSingapore owes its reputation as a global commodities hub to its position on sea lanes that connect China with global markets, along with its government’s business-friendly approach.\n\nGlobal trading houses including Trafigura, Vitol Group, Gunvor and Mercuria all have bases in the city, which is Asia’s largest oil trading hub and one of the largest in the world for trading agricultural commodities. The city state has also set its sights on becoming a hub for rapidly growing carbon trading.\n\nIts need to set itself apart has become more acute after Dubai’s rapid rise as a commodities trading hub, especially for Russian goods under sanctions by western governments.\n\n“The long arc of global history is full of stories of ports that have flourished and thrived for decades, only to decline amidst changing circumstances,” said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong during an event at Singapore’s mega Tuas Port project in October. “The lesson is that we cannot be complacent.”\n\nThe Lim case, along with several others in Singapore, came to light in 2020, when commodity prices slumped at the outbreak of the pandemic. Lim’s company, Hin Leong, collapsed in April 2020 and he admitted hiding $800mn in losses from creditors, which included some of the world’s biggest banks.\n\nHis was the largest of several trading houses in the city state that imploded that year. Others included the oil dealer ZenRock and Agritrade International, a trader accused of fraud by its lenders. Hontop Energy, the trading arm of a Shandong-based refiner, went into receivership and was accused by its biggest lender of “suspicious transactions”.\n\nA common theme of the scandals was dubious paperwork, used to secure credit from financial institutions in order to hide losses and make leveraged bets on commodity prices. Banks were willing to lend to the traders in expectation of chunky fees.\n\n“Paper documents have always been the Achilles heel of international trade,” said Baldev Bhinder, managing director of Blackstone & Gold, a specialist energy and commodities law firm in Singapore.\n\nLim was found guilty of encouraging his executives to forge two documents that purported to be oil sales contracts, which led to HSBC disbursing nearly $112mn to the company.\n\nAt the time of its collapse, Hin Leong owed $3.85bn. HSBC had the biggest exposure at $600mn, followed by ABN Amro at $300mn, while French lender Société Générale had lent the company $240mn. Singaporean banks — DBS Group, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank — had exposures worth $680mn.\n\nHSBC also lent $49mn to ZenRock, but reported the collapsed trader to Singaporean police over what it described as “dishonest practices”.\n\nAgritrade was found to have been granted $1.5bn of credit from 26 lenders. Its creditors accused the business of fraud through issuing duplicate bills of lading — the legal documents issued by transportation companies to shippers — to multiple banks as security against loans.\n\n“Prosecutors are taking a more proactive approach,” said Kit Smith, a UK-based lawyer specialising in global fraud and trade disputes at Keidan Harrison. “There is a push to be more stringent on big-ticket frauds and make examples of the perpetrators.”\n\nEnterprise Singapore, the government agency charged with promoting business, said there was “zero tolerance for fraudulent activities in Singapore”.\n\n“The fraud cases seen in the commodities trading sector in the past have been attributed to weak disclosure practices and internal controls among a minority of the trading companies,” it said in a statement to the Financial Times.\n\n“When Singapore authorities discover financial fraud in the trading sector, we will take immediate action to bring perpetrators to task as seen in the case of Hin Leong.”\n\nThe government has also launched a series of initiatives in recent years aimed at impeding fraudsters’ ability to rip-off creditors.\n\nAmong them is a trade finance registry to prevent the same asset being pledged as a security for more than one loan to different institutions. The government has also tried to encourage traders to move away from paper documentation, instead exchanging digital records on a public blockchain to reduce forgeries.\n\nWhile Lambert said Singapore was “raising the stakes in terms of compliance and regulatory requirements”, he added that regulators should have been firmer in previous accounting scandals.\n\nThe scandals have also forced banks to take a much more stringent approach to lending to commodity traders. Several lenders announced they were pulling out of the market in 2020.\n\n“Banks are approaching their customers with a great deal more vigilance now, which is a good thing, but it has meant smaller traders are finding it harder to attract financing,” said Bhinder.\n\n“Lim’s sentencing closes a chapter for Singapore and the commodities trading market — it has been a learning experience for everyone.”",

    "body": "An octogenarian oil trader has been given a 17-and-a-half-year jail sentence in Singapore for defrauding HSBC, in a long-running case that sent shockwaves through the city-state’s commodity trading sector.\n\nLim Oon Kuin, known as OK Lim and once one of Singapore’s richest men, was sentenced on Monday after being convicted in May of “cheating” HSBC and abetting forgery. The 82-year-old founder of Hin Leong Trading was accused of encouraging a company executive to forge documents that tricked the bank into disbursing nearly $112mn.\n\nJudge Toh Han Li of Singapore’s State Courts said the length of Lim’s sentence was designed to act as a “deterrent”. Prosecutors had sought a jail term of up to 20 years; Lim’s defence lawyer Davinder Singh argued for seven years, given his age and poor health. Lim attended court hearings in a wheelchair.\n\nBloomberg reported that Singh had appealed on behalf of his client and Lim would not begin his sentence until after the appeal hearing.\n\nThe case had centred on allegations that Hin Leong had been hiding losses from trading in futures markets and selling off oil inventories already pledged as collateral for loans.\n\nLim was originally charged in 2020 after confessing to hiding $800mn in losses from creditors — including HSBC and Singapore’s biggest lender DBS — and directing the company’s finance department not to disclose the losses.\n\nHe was initially hit with 130 criminal charges involving hundreds of millions of dollars, but was eventually tried on just three.\n\nSingapore’s pivotal position on global shipping lanes connecting China with global markets, as well as its stability and low corporate tax rates, have made it one of the most important global hubs for commodities trading.\n\nBut a spate of scandals in the market throughout the 2010s raised questions about Singapore’s ability to rein in its trading houses. Several cases centred around fraud and forged documents. Paper trails make up the backbone of the industry.\n\nWith a single delivery truck, Lim founded Hin Leong in 1963 as an oil distributor. Over the decades, the family business grew to become Singapore’s largest independent oil trader and a major supplier of shipping fuel.\n\nBut the collapse in the oil market in 2020 sent his empire into a tailspin. Lim filed for bankruptcy last month and agreed to pay S$4.5bn (US$3.3bn) to liquidators and creditor HSBC to settle long-running civil lawsuits.",

    "body": "Hello, this is Kenji. I am writing this week’s newsletter from Bangkok, where I am attending an annual meeting with colleagues from across the region.\n\nI was posted here as an editor about a decade ago, and it’s always a pleasure to come back, but the positioning of Thailand — and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as a whole — has shifted significantly, especially since tensions between the US and China started to heat up around 2018.\n\nGetting caught between great power rivals like this is something smaller nations seek to avoid, and members of Asean are no exception. But even when countries do get drawn into these power plays, it is not always in a negative way, such as Vietnam attracting substantial investments and emerging as a major manufacturing hub of various tech products during this period.\n\nAs we feature in this edition of the newsletter, Singapore has enjoyed a sharp rise up the global ranking of start-up ecosystems, as investment in so-called deep tech surged against a backdrop of Sino-American tensions. Cambodia, meanwhile, is becoming a battleground between China and Japan, a key US ally, in terms of telecom infrastructure building, which could turn into a positive for local users as increased competition brings better services at lower prices.\n\nOf course, anyone can find themselves in the crossfire of the US-China rivalry, as our Taipei colleagues remind us with their scoop this week about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) halting shipments to certain customers to avoid inadvertently violating US export controls on China.\n\nNo matter who is elected president in the US next week — Kamala Harris or Donald Trump — other countries will continue having to navigate the Washington-Beijing rivalry with all its various consequences.\n\nTSMC, the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, has stopped shipping to at least two chip developers over suspicions they were trying to circumvent US export controls on China’s Huawei Technologies, Nikkei Asia’s tech correspondents Cheng Ting-Fang and Lauly Li reported in this exclusive story from Taipei.\n\nThe two developers placed orders for chips made with 7-nanometre process technology, which TSMC has been using for mass production since 2018. Washington has been restricting chipmaking equipment containing American technology from being used to make chips of 14nm or better for China without an export license. TSMC’s most advanced commercial products are the 3-nm processor chips used for Apple’s iPhone 16 series.\n\nEnforcing Washington’s export controls is far from straightforward, as chip developers could use layers of non-Chinese shell companies to camouflage their orders, according to sources.\n\nTSMC reiterated to Nikkei Asia that it has not supplied Huawei since mid-September 2020 in compliance with the US export restrictions.\n\nSamsung Electronics is struggling to hold on to its crown as the world’s top-selling smartphone maker, write the Financial Times’ Song Jung-a and Christian Davies.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant was the only one of the top five global smartphone makers to experience falling shipments in the third quarter of this year, losing market share to US rival Apple and Chinese contenders offering slick new foldable devices.\n\nResearch group TechInsights expects Apple’s new generative artificial intelligence features to help power the US company past Samsung next year.\n\nSamsung once pioneered foldable devices but ceded the top spot earlier this year to Chinese rival Huawei, which had a 27.5 per cent share of the foldables market in the second quarter, compared with Samsung’s 16.4 per cent, according to IDC.\n\nThe company’s smartphone struggles come at a critical point. It has been hit by a series of failures at its semiconductor division, which accounts for 60 per cent of Samsung’s operating profit.\n\n“Deep tech” endeavours in Singapore are getting a boost amid the ever-intensifying Sino-American tech tensions. Nikkei Asia’s Tsubasa Suruga reports that investment in this field — which is based on scientific research with potentially large social impacts like chips, robotics and medicine — was up 31 per cent by volume last year, even as overall start-up investment dropped 20 per cent.\n\nBased on data by DealStreetAsia and Enterprise Singapore, deep tech accounted for 25 per cent of the total deal value, up from 17 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe boost in deep tech investment helped push the city-state’s global start-up ecosystem ranking to seventh this year, up from 18th just two years ago, and leapfrogging all other Asian hubs, including Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo, according to US-based research company Startup Genome.\n\nInvestors — who are mostly local or American, but also from Taiwan, Japan, France and Malaysia — say deep tech tends to remain under the radar due to the complex technology and expertise involved, but it is gaining importance amid the US-China trade war and supply chain shifts.\n\nA Japanese tech consortium, with help from government subsidies, is challenging the Chinese dominance in the 5G market. The initial battleground is Cambodia, an ostensibly neutral country that has shown itself to be a staunch ally to Beijing, according to an exclusive report by Nikkei’s Kiu Sugano, Shiho Miyajima and Kyoko Hariya.\n\nOrex Sai, a joint venture between NTT DoCoMo and NEC, will build a 4G network at a large commercial complex in the south-east Asian country by March, which will serve as a platform for transitioning to 5G in the future.\n\nCambodia’s telecom network, like many around the world, is reliant on equipment from Huawei Technologies. The Chinese company and its compatriot ZTE together control more than 40 per cent of the global market for 5G base stations, British research company Omdia says. Japanese players as a whole hold about 3 per cent.\n\nFor this Cambodia project, Tokyo is applying a new aid policy that applies government assistance proactively rather than waiting for a request from a recipient country. The development co-operation charter revised last year, which stresses Japanese aid money “does not involve debt traps or economic coercion, and that does not undermine the independence and sustainability of developing countries”, will also be applied to the project.",

    "body": "Addison Lee, the UK-based private-hire taxi and courier company, has agreed to be bought by Singapore-listed transport conglomerate ComfortDelGro in a deal valuing the business at £269.1mn.\n\nComfortDelGro, a multinational company with operations ranging from taxis to rail and London buses, is buying Addison Lee from a consortium led by chief executive Liam Griffin and Cheyne Capital.\n\nOn Wednesday ComfortDelGro said the acquisition, to be done through its UK subsidiary CityFleet Networks, would enable it to expand into the “premium mobility segment” and help its shift towards clean energy vehicles.\n\nThe combined group’s taxi and private hire network will consist of more than 34,000 vehicles globally upon completion of the deal.\n\nThe transaction marks the third change of ownership in just over a decade for Addison Lee, as the London taxi market has been disrupted by ride-hailing apps such as Uber, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nPrivate equity group Carlyle bought the business from the Griffin family, Addison Lee’s founders, for £300mn in 2013. The purchase came just as ride-hailing apps were beginning to shake up the London market.\n\nGriffin, the son of Addison Lee’s founder, bought the business back in 2020 “at a significant discount” to the £300mn as part of a consortium of investors led by Cheyne Capital.\n\nThe owners restructured the business and refocused it on London’s premium and corporate customers.\n\n“We have sat in this premium niche we think people are prepared to pay for,” Griffin told the Financial Times in March. He will remain as chief executive of the company, which returned to profit in 2023 following the pandemic.\n\nOn Wednesday, Griffin said ComfortDelGro had “a clear understanding of our customers’ and drivers’ needs” and would bring “significant international industry expertise to the business”.\n\nThe acquisition increases the Singaporean group’s presence in the UK, where it already operates services including the Megabus inter-city coach service and nearly a fifth of the London bus network through its Metroline business.\n\nIt said Addison Lee would also complement CityFleet’s existing operations in north-west England and Scotland.\n\n“Beyond expanding our footprint in the UK, this acquisition will enable us to use Addison Lee’s expertise to deepen and scale our premium point-to-point capability globally,” said ComfortDelGro’s chief executive Cheng Siak Kian.\n\nComfortDelGro’s international operations include its French unit, which will begin operating part of the Paris Métro Line 15 by the end of 2025.\n\nIt is the largest taxi operator in Singapore, where it also operates a fleet of more than 3,000 buses and 83km of rail network.",

    "blurb": "Lee Hsien Yang claims he and his family faced persecution at home",
    "date": "2024-10-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "The son of the late Lee Kuan Yew, the modern-day founder of Singapore, has quietly been granted political asylum in Britain, in an implicit condemnation of the civil liberties offered by the city-state.\n\nLee Hsien Yang, together with his wife, Lee Suet Fern, a lawyer, have overcome objections from the UK’s Home Office to win refugee status in Britain, having successfully argued they would face persecution if they were to return to Singapore.\n\nThe couple have been in self-imposed exile in London since 2022 following a criminal investigation by the Singaporean authorities and an accompanying threat of being charged with perjury.\n\nA dynastic feud burst into public view after the death of Lee Kuan Yew in 2015, with Lee Hsien Yang and his sister, Lee Wei Ling, battling their elder brother, Lee Hsien Loong, who spent 20 years as prime minister, over the future of the famous family home in Singapore, at 38 Oxley Road.\n\nThat dispute is likely to flare once more after Lee Wei Ling’s death earlier this month, at the age of 69, following a long illness, because she lived at the house. During his lifetime, Lee Kuan Yew had repeatedly stated that once his children had moved out of the family home, the property should be demolished to avoid it becoming a shrine to himself. Lee Hsien Yang wanted his wishes enforced, but other family members disagreed.\n\nIn response to inquiries over the asylum move this week, the Singapore authorities released a 5,000-word statement, repeating claims that Lee Suet Fern had tampered with the final draft of Lee Kuan Yew’s will in order to reinstate a “demolition clause” regarding 38 Oxley Road and also carve out a larger portion of the estate for her husband.\n\nLee Wei Ling, an accomplished doctor who established the National Neuroscience Institute in the former British colony, diagnosed herself with progressive supranuclear palsy in 2020.\n\nHer death was announced by Lee Hsien Yang on Facebook, with her younger brother immediately calling afresh for the demolition of 38 Oxley Road.\n\nLee Hsien Loong, who stepped aside as prime minister earlier this year but who remains a senior minister, responded on Facebook, saying: “I held nothing against Ling, and continued to do whatever I could to ensure her welfare,” adding that she was “fiercely loyal to friends, sympathised instinctively with the underdog, and would mobilise actively to do something when she saw unfairness, or suspected wrongdoing”.\n\nIn seeking political asylum in Britain, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern are understood to have successfully argued that their brother Lee Hsien Loong has used the organs of state against their wing of the family to block any chance that their son, Li Shengwu, might enter politics in Singapore and one day rise to the position of prime minister.\n\nLi Shengwu, an economist who has adopted a different English spelling of the family name, was recently granted tenure at Harvard University, where he is a professor. He has denied having any interest in pursuing a political career, but nevertheless considers himself to be exiled from the city-state.\n\nSingapore’s legal system, particularly its libel laws frequently used by Lee Kuan Yew and his successors, has long made life difficult for the political opponents of the Singapore government and for the media.\n\nIn its statement, the Singapore government insisted Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern, along with their son, “are and have always been free to return to Singapore”, adding that the city state’s judiciary is impartial and makes decisions independently.\n\nIt added: “As the government has stated on many occasions, in parliament and elsewhere, senior minister Lee Hsien Loong has long recused himself on all matters relating to 38 Oxley Road,” adding that while Lee Kuan Yew “preferred demolition, he was also willing to consider other options such as refurbishing and redesigning the interior”.\n\nPosting on Facebook, Lee Hsien Yang said: “In 2017, my sister Wei Ling and I declared, ‘We do not trust Hsien Loong as a brother or as a leader.’ We stated that we feared the abuse of the organs of the Singapore state against us and against my family. Because of that risk, I was unable to attend Wei Ling’s funeral.”\n\nHe said the Singapore government’s attacks against him were a matter of public record. “On the basis of these facts, the UK has determined that I face a well-founded risk of persecution, and cannot safely return to Singapore.”\n\nWhile the figures are low compared with more troubled parts of the world, data from the UN refugee agency UNHCR shows a marked rise in the number of Singapore nationals seeking asylum elsewhere, a trend that Singapore’s critics put down to the authoritarian nature of the city-state’s government.",

    "body": "The VSOE is the fantasy progenitor, five-star sleeper of dreams. The vintage cars, all restored down to the last hand-enamelled panel, date from between 1926 and 1949 — with the notable exception of one very fabulous addition this year: L’Observatoire, a brand-new full-car suite complete with “secret” tearoom and library, designed by the French artist JR (it’s now taking bookings for travel from March 2025, for an extremely bucket list-y £80,000 per trip).\n\nThanks to an assertive 2021 expansion, the VSOE now calls in at more destinations than ever: Prague, Lyon, Florence, Vienna, Budapest, Istanbul, Rome. It can also be booked in exclusivity for milestone events, which allows for customised itineraries should you and your fellow revellers wish to call in at, say, Chiavari or Ancona. (Not that the standard one-night Paris-to-Venice route won’t give you all the feels, treats and Alpine views you need.)\n\nChef Jean Imbert does haute table all the way — turbot in champagne sauce, lamb loin, mignardises to finish — across the VSOE’s three dining cars. Breakfast can be delivered in your cabin, and the top-level suites are provisioned with free-flowing Petrossian and champagne. In the never-actually-closes bar car there’s a baby grand piano for (mostly) unironic after-midnight singalongs.\n\nToeing the fantasy line means throwback elegance during the day. Black tie is expressly encouraged come evening; likewise, the laying on of sequins, beads, fancy baubles and generally the sartorial shimmer and shake that confers extra sex appeal. When in doubt, go with Le Smoking — Tom Ford for him, Saint Laurent for her (perhaps with a bejewelled choker. And nothing under the jacket).\n\nThe name is a shortening of the original Afghan Express, so-called for the Afghan cameleers who mapped the train’s north-south route from Darwin to Adelaide in the late 19th century, traversing some of Australia’s most severe and spectacular interior landscapes. This being Outback Oz, the experience is low-key without skimping. In the new Gold Premium suites, walnut cabinetry and brass are complemented by Indigenous prints; Gold twin or single cabins are cosier berths. Picture windows are uniformly huge, regardless of travel class.\n\nThe full four-day, three-night, 3,000km experience stops in historic Katherine and Alice Springs in the Northern Territory before passing through the dead centre of the country en route to the mining town of Coober Pedy and on to Adelaide. Excursions include bushwalks, visits to Indigenous art galleries and alfresco lantern-lit dinners; an extra spend gets you helicopter tours and a private visit to Uluru.\n\nStraightforward, modern Australian, including excellent wines, craft beers and spirits, though Platinum travellers have the Bollinger on free-flow. They also have their own restaurant car, whose chefs privilege local-to-the-route providores. But the charm seems concentrated in the Queen Adelaide restaurant, where ricotta hotcakes à la Granger & Co are a breakfast highlight. Everything, down to that last midnight glass of Seppeltsfield Para Tawny, is included in the price.\n\nThe Orient Express this is not: nice trousers and linen shirts will see you through supper. Far more important is having your bush- whacking best — the right shoes, layers, hats and sunscreen — for the vagaries of light and temperature on the excursions. Basically you can’t go wrong with breathe-tech Slowear and an old pair of Blundies.\n\nThis opulent Belmond overnighter — which used to connect Singapore and Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur and Penang — was relaunched at the start of 2024. The refurbished cars gleam with tropical-hardwood marquetry, brass details, gold-threaded passementerie and a diffuse Victorian-splendour ambience. There’s an observation car, with walls of windows and simple settee seating, and a bar with a rotating host of crooners and the odd roving magician. A very Belmond bonus: the onboard Dior Spa (a carriage with two treatment rooms).\n\nBelmond has teased that Bangkok will be back on the agenda by next year; meanwhile, the E&OE traces two itineraries in and out of Singapore. “Wild Malaysia” takes you variously hiking, e-biking, caving and tiger-spotting (if you’re lucky) in Merapoh and Taman Negara National Park. “Essence of Malaysia” is about street-food tasting, art tours of George Town (the bustling ex-colonial capital of Penang), and speed-boating off the beaches of Langkawi.\n\nSome of us think the most exciting aspect of the E&OE reboot is resident chef André Chiang, whose eponymous restaurant in Singapore racked up multiple Michelin stars and best-in-Asia accolades before closing in 2018. Onboard, he marries and reinterprets French and south-east Asian traditions: think steaming bowls of laksa bouillabaisse and spicy cacao ganache.\n\nJungle-trekking and sea spray by day don’t preclude de rigueur evening gloss. Along with The Organic Pharmacy’s bug repellent, sturdy-soled walkers and loose cotton-linen (with full-length sleeves), bring a couple of Dodo Bar Or or Anine Bing silk slip dresses. For him, chinos and a travel jacket from Connolly or De Bonne Facture.\n\nPowered by a venture between hospitality behemoth Accor (owner of the Orient Express brand name), luxury property fund Arsenale and three Italian train companies, La Dolce Vita aims to give the VSOE a run for its Italy money by making the journey as much about the destinations and way-stops as the trains themselves. Not that those will be anything to sneeze at, designed by Milanese darlings Dimore Studio with mirrored walls, groovy ’60s- and ’70s-inspired textiles and scads of Gio Ponti, Osvaldo Borsani and Gae Aulenti-inspired flourishes everywhere.\n\nThe premium is on place, connecting destinations previously unserviced by luxury sleeper train, from Montalcino in southern Tuscany to Maratea and Matera in Basilicata, Monferrato in Piedmont (for truffles and Nebbiolo), and even Sicily. The excursions will include tastings, private palazzi, world heritage sites and aperitivi in five-star partner hotels, such as Maratea’s lovely Santavenere, along the way.\n\nA waves-making name was needed, and they sure tapped one: Heinz Beck, the thrice Michelin-starred founder of the Order of The Knights of Italian Cuisine, whose La Pergola in Rome remains one of Italy’s premier gourmet destinations. La Dolce Vita has also partnered with Vinitaly to have exclusive access to award-winning vintages, representing northern, central and southern Italy and personally selected by Beck, on the carte.\n\nHigh Italian glamour: from floor-length La DoubleJ printed frocks to wide-lapelled jackets from Giuliva Heritage or Cifonelli. Plus Capri sandals and navy and black velvet furlane for both sexes. Launches spring 2025\n\nSince its launch in 2010 (first covered in HTSI’s pages), the Maharajas’ has been touted as the closest thing there is to a palace on wheels, from the dedicated butler-per-client ratio to the generous size of the suites, with their separate lounging and sleeping quarters (and, in some cases, full-sized tubs in the bathrooms); its 23 carriages measure almost half a mile. Red carpets, fuchsia silk canopies and musicians and dancers greet guests at arrival stations. There are two restaurants, a bar and games lounge, and even a boutique. Palette- and materials-wise, more is more is always more, with just a bit extra for good measure.\n\nThe various three- to six-night itineraries are multi-state journeys that connect all-star destinations in northern and central India; the train trundles along old state-railway lines by night, calling in by day at Mehrangarh Fort, Orchha, Ranthambore (whence India’s most famous tiger safaris), the Taj Mahal or the temples at Khajuraho. Caravans and the occasional vintage limousine ferry guests to and from sites, or to cocktails and dinner at heritage palace hotels along the route.\n\nGenerally good, if with less wow factor than on comparable trains elsewhere (perhaps it’s time for state owners IRCTC to consider luring a Garima Arora or Gaggan Anand aboard?). Traditional Indian — including a daily regional thali and rustic Mewari dishes — alternates with standard continental and international fare; both restaurants, Mayur Mahal and Rang Mahal, cater to carnivores and vegetarians.\n\nYour best kani weave pashmina from Kashmir Loom or Andraab — good for elegant onboard suppers and for covering shoulders at holy sites both Hindu and Muslim.",

    "date": "2024-10-1600:00:00.0",
    "body": "The rich have always been welcomed in Switzerland. To spend, but more importantly to hoard. Across the country, in secretive locations, banks operate underground vaults and storage facilities — often converted military bunkers that have been hewn from mountain rock. Some have no roads nearby and can only be accessed by air.\n\nAt one facility 40km south of Lucerne, storage company Brünig Mega Safe is carving into an imposing mountain and plans to offer “professional and secure storage of assets in underground caverns” for anything from gold bars and stock certificates to artworks and classic cars. Prices start at $500,000 for a 25 sqm vault.\n\nFor three centuries, the country has also offered the rich reliable, specialist advice on managing and investing their money. In times of war, political turmoil and rising taxes, the country’s stability and geopolitical neutrality — combined with its strict adherence to banking discretion — supported a thriving and world-leading wealth management industry.\n\nBut, in recent years, those foundations have begun to crack — and its rivals in Asia are looking on. Under international pressure, Switzerland has been chipping away at its banking secrecy laws that restrict banks from passing on details about their clients to governments. And the country’s decision to sanction Russian oligarchs following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago has dented its reputation for international neutrality.\n\nMeanwhile, the collapse last year of Credit Suisse — the country’s second-biggest bank, trusted by millions of wealthy clients globally — has cast a shadow over Switzerland’s claim to be a stable nation with a sturdy financial services sector. The remainder of the Swiss banking sector is aware of what this means. “Singapore and Hong Kong are going to be more and more important competitors to Switzerland as global hubs,” says Giorgio Pradelli, chief executive of Swiss private bank EFG, which operates in all three countries and is increasingly focused on Asia.\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is set to overtake Switzerland as the world’s biggest offshore wealth hub by 2028, with Singapore not far behind. Hong Kong would then account for $3.2tn out of the total $17.1tn in global offshore wealth assets, compared with $3.1tn for Switzerland and $2.5tn for Singapore, according to Boston Consulting Group estimates.\n\nIn the five years to 2028, Hong Kong’s cross-border wealth market is on track to grow by 6 per cent a year in terms of assets, compared with 3.6 per cent in Switzerland and 8.5 per cent in Singapore.\n\n“Switzerland will always be our competitor, but we are not afraid,” says Jason Fong, a 27-year banking and asset management veteran who has been tasked by the Hong Kong government with attracting family offices to the Chinese territory. “They are crumbling and we are in a very advantageous situation.”\n\nMuch has changed since the early 18th century, when France’s Catholic kings tapped the banks of Geneva for funds, but tried to conceal their dealings with the city’s Huguenot financiers, fearing a sectarian backlash at home. An edict from the Great Council of Geneva in 1713 prohibited bankers from sharing client registers with the authorities.\n\nGeneva’s commitment to banking discretion helped elevate it into a European financial powerhouse and drew in Swiss mercenary soldiers who were looking to safeguard their money made from fighting abroad. “The Swiss laid the foundation for today’s global wealth management model,” says Iqbal Khan, co-head of wealth management at UBS. “Its heritage comes from the duty of care for others’ property and the principle of self-control.”\n\nSecrecy became enshrined in Swiss legislation with a 1934 banking law, which set out that bankers who disclosed client information could be jailed. Initially, European Jews fleeing persecution set up Swiss bank accounts to protect their valuables, but later such accounts were favoured by Nazis to store their looted wealth. A Swiss bank account soon became the financial product of choice for the rich who did not want too much attention on their fortunes’ sources.\n\nThis commitment to clandestine banking attracted despots and oligarchs throughout the 20th century, while tax-evading lawyers and country doctors from neighbouring European countries made up a large proportion of Swiss private banks’ clients. It was in the middle of the 20th century that Swiss bankers attracted the nickname of the “gnomes of Zurich” from British politicians for their ability to hoard heaps of gold in underground vaults. It was soon regarded as a badge of honour. Swiss bankers took to answering calls from British colleagues by saying: “Hello, gnome speaking.”\n\nMore recently, though, under pressure from tax authorities around the world following a series of high-profile scandals over the flows of illicit money, Switzerland has acquiesced to demands for greater transparency around its banking sector.\n\nIn 2017, it signed up to the international automatic exchange of information standard, which requires Swiss financial institutions to share details on their clients with the countries where they are tax resident. More than 100 countries are signed up to the same standard, which has all but killed off Switzerland’s allure for tax evaders.\n\nThe final blow for Swiss banking discretion came two years ago with the Suisse Secrets scandal, where documents detailing the accounts of 30,000 Credit Suisse clients were leaked to a consortium of international media outlets. Among those named in the cache of documents — which dated back to the 1940s — were war criminals, autocrats, oligarchs, drug smugglers and human traffickers.\n\nThe collapse of Credit Suisse prompted the Swiss government to devise a series of proposals to bolster the banking system, including giving more power to the domestic financial regulator and potentially increasing UBS’s capital requirements. Executives in Zurich fear that if the new measures are too draconian, they could ultimately put their banks at a disadvantage to their foreign rivals.\n\n“Financial centres like Hong Kong, Singapore and the US are aggressively competing, and making great progress, for the offshore wealth management crown that Switzerland holds today,” UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti said in June. “Foreign financial centres would benefit if Switzerland were to restrict its ability to maintain a leading presence abroad.”\n\nSwitzerland’s reputation for neutrality on the world stage has proved enticing over the decades for the global and mobile rich, especially in times of rising geopolitical tension. Yet this, too, is being tested. The decision by Switzerland following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to sign up to the US and EU sanctions regimes has led to questions from clients about whether the country is still an impartial player.\n\nA recent report from the Swiss Bankers Association lobby group identified Switzerland’s adherence to international sanctions regimes as the top geopolitical risk facing the country’s wealth managers. The immediate effect of implementing sanctions was Swiss banks pulling out of Russia and jettisoning Russian clients, many of whom switched their offshore bank accounts to the Middle East.\n\nJimmy Lee, head of Asia-Pacific at Julius Baer, has run several western banks’ Singapore and Hong Kong operations over the past three decades. He says he is often asked by clients whether Switzerland is still neutral. “We explain to them that Ukraine is at the doorstep of Switzerland and they are taking a stance,” he says. “If your neighbour’s house is on fire, you cannot stay neutral.”\n\nThe Ukraine war has brought Switzerland closer to Nato, with a recent paper commissioned by the country’s defence ministry suggesting Swiss troops could co-operate in military manoeuvres with other states for the first time since 1515.\n\nAs Switzerland grapples with its five-century-old commitment to neutrality, rival wealth management hubs have sought to project their own credentials as non-partisan places to do business. “Some of these Asian wealth hubs played their hand extremely well,” says a Swiss bank executive. “They managed to position themselves as neutral, although they all adopted the US sanctions just like we did.”\n\nThe story of how Asia’s two main financial entrepôts copied the Swiss white-glove model of wealth management and ended up outpacing their European rival could be seen as a historical quirk — a byproduct of the supercharged growth in Asian wealth in the 21st century. But, in Singapore’s case, it was more by design. It was on a trip to Zurich in 1967, two years after Singapore’s independence from Malaysia, that Lee Kuan Yew set upon the idea of transforming the nation he had founded into Asia’s financial hub. Lee, the country’s first prime minister, had seen the way Switzerland, a small country with few natural resources and surrounded by powerful neighbours, had established itself over several centuries as the global centre of offshore banking and wealth management.\n\nSingapore’s government followed Switzerland’s lead in designing its tax system to attract rich foreigners looking for a base to park their wealth, while also encouraging Swiss private banks to set up shop. “We have . . . deliberately encouraged the development of Singapore as a financial centre,” Lee said on a subsequent trip to Zurich in 1971 while speaking at a reception at the Union Bank of Switzerland. “Singapore sets out to be to south-east Asia what Switzerland is to Europe — a money and gold market.”\n\nPart of the reason for the rise of Hong Kong and Singapore as offshore wealth hubs is down to demographics and how quickly a wealthy upper class has emerged in Asia in recent decades. Mainland China is now home to 6mn millionaires, the second-highest number behind the US. This weight of money funnelling into Hong Kong from mainland China, which accounts for just under half of the cross-border money flowing into Hong Kong’s wealth managers, according to McKinsey, has driven its rapid growth — even as that of Switzerland and Singapore, to a lesser extent, has slowed.\n\nThis proximity is one of the main reasons UBS recently announced it would move its local headquarters to a tower sitting on top of the West Kowloon train terminus. The new development is designed to connect Hong Kong by high-speed rail to the surrounding Greater Bay Area, the largest and most populated urban area in the world.\n\nBy contrast, Singapore acts more like an entry point for global investors into south-east, and increasingly, north Asia. China is expected to account for about 30 per cent of wealth inflows into the city state over the next five years, with Hong Kong and Taiwan the next biggest markets.\n\nA sign of Hong Kong and Singapore’s growing importance as offshore wealth hubs is the booming market for family offices. These small, private companies are set up to manage the wealth of one or maybe a handful of wealthy families, providing a full suite of services, from tax and succession planning to investing and philanthropy. Both Hong Kong and Singapore are on course to report record numbers of launches this year. There were 50 family offices operating in Singapore in 2018, but that has ballooned to 1,650 today. Hong Kong, meanwhile, has more than 2,700.\n\nThe new launches are typically serving families in other Asian countries looking to diversify where their wealth is managed, transferring a large chunk from their domestic market to meet their global interests or give them options if things get uncomfortable at home. Singapore, in particular, is attracting family office branches from further afield. “Some are coming from the Middle East and Europe,” says Jin Yee Young, co-head of Asia-Pacific wealth management at UBS, who runs the Singapore business. “They see Singapore as a window to the region. They are very established, some are even multigenerational family offices, and they are looking to tap into investments in the region.”\n\nWhen Hong Kong and Singapore were starting to establish their wealth management sectors, they looked to the Swiss model for inspiration. Yet for a long time, the clients had vastly different needs. “When I started in private banking in the 1990s, it was about the private individual and their needs,” says Amy Lo, the other co-head of UBS’s Apac wealth business, who runs the Hong Kong operation. “As things have globalised, 70 per cent of our clients are entrepreneurs and now it is much more about succession planning, looking after their businesses, philanthropy and doing good for society.”\n\nThe authorities in Singapore and Hong Kong are working on ways to improve the local talent pools to ensure they can meet evolving client needs. “Whenever I go to the Asian international financial centres, the general discussion is always on how to increase the number of people who are interested in working in wealth management,” says Pradelli of EFG. “Talent is very important. While we traditionally have a strong talent base for our industry in Switzerland, the pipeline of talent in Asian financial centres is strong and improving, but still quite scarce.”\n\nSingapore has had an influx of money from China and Hong Kong in recent years, as rich individuals moved their wealth from what they regard as an increasingly authoritarian Chinese state. But those inflows culminated in a S$3bn ($2.34bn) scandal last year, in which 10 Chinese nationals were convicted of money laundering following Singapore’s biggest investigation into online gambling in Asia. It involved island-wide raids and the seizure of gold bars, expensive wines, crypto assets, designer handbags and luxury cars. Banks in Singapore have responded by heightening scrutiny of foreign customers and intensifying efforts to identify sources of wealth, leading to delays in onboarding new customers.\n\nWhile some critics have suggested the episode highlighted lax controls in Singapore’s burgeoning family office sector, Marco Pagliara, head of emerging markets at Deutsche Bank’s private bank, attributes it more to growing pains that the local regulator responded to.\n\n“There was a phase where there was a significant flow coming from north Asia — on the back of that there was correction that needed to be implemented. They did it quite swiftly,” says Pagliara. “Singapore is focused on running a very tight and organised ship with the way they manage their financial centre.”\n\nThis month, the Singaporean government published a package of recommendations to tighten anti-money-laundering rules in the city state, including improving information sharing between departments and giving prosecutors stronger powers. “We continually engage the industry and stakeholders to ensure that our framework remains robust against illegitimate wealth and welcoming of legitimate businesses and investors,” said the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country’s financial regulator.\n\nThough their home market has been losing ground, Switzerland’s wealth managers are seeking to capitalise on the growth in Asia by building on the cachet associated with being a Swiss bank. “Swissness stands for high quality, trust and credibility,” says UBS’s Khan, who recently relocated to Hong Kong to run the bank’s Asia-Pacific business. “But that’s not enough in today’s world. You need to have cultural heritage as well.”\n\nKhan, who will split his time between Hong Kong and Singapore, had previously been the sole head of UBS’s wealth management business and was based in Zurich. But he is one of several senior executives at European wealth managers who have relocated to Asia as they target the region for growth. Asia’s biggest banks were mostly late to prioritise developing their own wealth management businesses and trail far behind their longer established competitors from Europe and the US. But they are starting to catch up.\n\nThe Swiss banks have recognised that although their country’s reputation as the world’s centre for wealth management has taken a hit in recent years, they can still dominate in rival financial hubs.\n\nThis article is part of FT Wealth, a section providing in-depth coverage of philanthropy, entrepreneurs, family offices, as well as alternative and impact investment",

    "date": "2024-10-0400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore has charged billionaire property tycoon Ong Beng Seng with abetting a minister as part of a corruption scandal that has tainted the city-state’s reputation for clean governance.\n\nOng, 78, was charged with two offences of abetting former transport minister S Iswaran to obtain gifts and obstruct justice, the Attorney-General’s Chambers said on Friday. Ong did not enter a plea, local media reported.\n\nThe indictment against Ong comes one day after Iswaran was sentenced to a one-year jail term for accepting gifts valued at more than $300,000 and obstructing justice. He became the first Singaporean minister to be imprisoned in nearly 50 years.\n\nIswaran was accused of accepting gifts from Ong, who owns the rights to the Singapore Grand Prix, at a time when he had official dealings with the tycoon. As transport minister, Iswaran was the most senior government official negotiating with Ong’s company on matters related to the Formula One race in Singapore.\n\nIswaran pleaded guilty last month to five charges, including four counts of obtaining valuable items and one of obstruction of justice. He resigned as transport minister earlier this year after he was formally charged.\n\nThe charges against Ong correspond to two of the charges to which Iswaran pleaded guilty, the AGC said.\n\nIswaran had initially faced 35 charges, though prosecutors proceeded with only five at the start of the trial. Most of the charges related to gifts from Ong, including tickets to English Premier League football matches, the Singapore F1 race, and plays including Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Hamilton and Kinky Boots as well as a business-class flight from Doha to Singapore in 2022.\n\nOng, a Malaysian citizen, was first arrested in July 2023 and released on bail. He is the majority owner of Singapore GP Pte, the promoter for the F1 race in Singapore. He is also the founder of Hotel Properties, which has brands including the Four Seasons and InterContinental in its property portfolio.\n\nThe Ong family also has a majority stake in the British luxury handbag maker Mulberry.\n\nIswaran was also charged with receiving gifts, including whisky and a Brompton T Line bicycle, from another businessman, Lum Kok Seng. Lum is the managing director of Lum Chang Holdings, a construction firm. He will not be charged, the AGC said on Friday.\n\nA lawyer for Ong declined to comment.\n\nThe scandal has come at a sensitive time for Singapore, which prides itself on its reputation for clean governance and transparency. Ministers in the Asian financial hub are among the highest paid in the world, earning about S$1mn (US$771,000) a year in part to discourage corruption.\n\nSingapore is set to hold elections next year, the first under new Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took office in May. The ruling People’s Action party — which has governed the city-state since independence in 1965 — is expected to win, but its reputation has taken a hit from a series of scandals, including the corruption allegations against Iswaran.\n\nIn a statement following Iswaran’s sentencing this week, Wong said he and his team would uphold the highest standards of integrity. “Our system ensures that our public officers are accountable, and no one is beyond scrutiny or above the law,” he said.",

    "blurb": "A wealthy local clientele looking for one-off designs has boosted the sector, and now word is spreading internationally",
    "date": "2024-10-0400:00:00.0",
    "body": "In a quiet street opposite Singapore’s Peranakan Museum, in a white art deco building, is the boutique of Singapore jeweller State Property. The business is owned by husband-and-wife team Afzal Imram, an industrial designer, and Central Saint Martins-trained jeweller Ruiyin Lin. They founded it as a local fine-jewellery brand, and it is one of the few with an international profile, thanks to expansion into North America.\n\nAcross town, in a high-rise block, is the very discreet showroom of Simone Jewels, which was established 18 years ago by Malaysian-born Simone Ng. In 2020, she became the first Singapore jeweller to be stocked in London department store Harrods and has retail clients in Paris and the US.\n\nShe is better known in Singapore and around the region, though, for her one-of-a-kind artistic high jewellery. Her colourful masterpieces are inspired by her love of history and architecture — currently the palaces of Istanbul — and, last year, she debuted a gender-neutral collection called Tattoo with symbol-shaped pendants and cocktail rings.\n\nAnd what they all show is that Singapore has no shortage of creativity or high-spending clients to support a local jewellery industry — even though the island state is not a big manufacturer, like Hong Kong or Bangkok.\n\n“Most things in Asia are generally mass-produced and creating one-in-the-world pieces is one of the reasons why we started the brand,” says Ng. “In Singapore, customers are well-versed and sophisticated in their jewellery purchases.”\n\nThe island may be small, but there are different types of jewellery markets, Ng explains. “Some like [their jewellery] simple, some like it large and luxurious, and others would only buy into luxury brands,” she says.\n\nThe city is the major shopping destination for the region, with many international luxury brands in the malls lining Orchard Road. Ng estimates 45 per cent of clients for her artistic masterpieces and bespoke designs are from elsewhere in south-east Asia, while 50 per cent are Singaporean and 5 per cent are from the rest of the world.\n\nSelf-purchasing women are the core clientele for most of the city’s jewellers. “We’ve got quite a number of bankers, doctors, and we’ve noticed recently more C-suite ladies and entrepreneur clients, [including] some from the cryptocurrency world,” says State Property’s Imram. The majority are Singaporean, but customers fly in from Indonesia and the Philippines, he adds. Local clients are quite brand-driven, so they start their collections with Cartier, Tiffany & Co and Bulgari, Imram says. “But we’ve seen a growing acceptance of local, independent labels, like State Property,” he notes.\n\nAs a brand that now has around a dozen retailers in North America alone, State Property has learnt to tailor its approach to diverse tastes. “The different lifestyles, spending habits, weather, even . . . the different sizes of people, this makes us pay closer attention to the nuances of each of our clients across markets,” Imram says. It allows the brand to break out of a narrow creative perspective and “helps us design better”, he adds.\n\nState Property’s modern art deco aesthetic is inspired by the blueprints of historic gardens. It combines gold, emeralds, diamonds and black enamel for bangles, earrings, pendants, a three-finger-spanning ring, and — always — signet rings (a favourite with clients). The majority of its American clients have slightly different tastes to those in Singapore, however. “One thing we hear from everyone is how the quality of our products is top-notch, which is something I have to thank our discerning Singaporean clientele for,” says Imram.\n\nThe relatively small society of an island state has given rise to a tradition for bespoke design, from restyling jade and family heirlooms to making something exclusive and unique. In Chinatown there is Madly (which has satellite boutiques in Munich and Dubai) where clients choose from colourful gemstones and commission bespoke designs, mostly rings.\n\nIn the gentrified Tiong Bahru enclave is Calla Lily. Founded five years ago by Emily Tan, who previously worked with Jimmy Choo and Marni before graduating from the Gemological Institute of America, it creates vibrant, contemporary bespoke jewels. “Bespoke has always been a natural inclination for me as it allows me to explore different looks and styles,” Tan says of designs that are inspired by the personalities and dreams of her clients.\n\n“The local market highly values one-of-a-kind pieces, giving us a competitive edge, and the rarity of certain gemstones also makes large-scale production difficult.”\n\nBudgets vary wildly, she says, “from S$2,000 to S$5,000 [$1,500-$3,000], but they can go up to S$100,000 and more, depending on the gemstones we source”. Singaporean women feel very safe moving around the city wearing thousands of dollars’ worth of jewellery, Tan notes, so they can enjoy their jewellery without having to wait for a special occasion — which “often leads them to return for more unique designs”.\n\nWhile Singapore attracts big luxury brands, it has also been a draw for independent jewellery designers. Two years ago, Nadine Ghosn relocated to Singapore, having lived between Paris and London. “I wanted the experience of living in a new place that has great positive energy and [2022] was the time to do it,” she says. “I love Asia, the speed, the safety and the family vibes of Singapore.”\n\nShe has found a ready market for her quirky jewels inspired by everyday items such as Lego, crayons and bicycle chains. “I’ve found locals and new Indonesian and Thai clients open to something different, colourful, fun and customised to their preferences,” Ghosn says, citing her gold Pencil and Crayon bangles and rings, and the stackable Veggie Burger rings, as bestsellers. “I think they appreciate the tongue-in-cheek and unexpectedness of my designs.” Clients start with one piece and return for more. “It has definitely been my most rewarding move so far,” she says.",

In 1975, Wee Toon Boon was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison for accepting gifts from a businessman. His sentence was reduced on appeal to 18 months.\n\nAnother cabinet minister, Teh Cheang Wan, was investigated for accepting bribes in 1986 but died before any charges were brought.\n\nIswaran was accused of obtaining gifts worth S$403,297.92 from two local businessmen during his tenure as minister.

    "body": "Bacha Coffee has grown across Asia by establishing itself in some of the region’s wealthiest districts and airports. Now the Singapore-based coffee brand is embarking on an aggressive expansion as it launches a store on the Champs-Elysées in Paris and other locations across Europe.\n\nThe Paris shop is expected to open by the end of the year and is part of a plan to establish more than 150 stores worldwide within three years. The company is also planning to open stores in China, one of Asia’s most competitive coffee markets, where Starbucks is coming under increasing pressure.\n\nTaha Bouqdib, chief executive and president of V3 Gourmet, the food and beverage group that owns Bacha Coffee and TWG Tea, told the Financial Times he wanted to be in “all the major cities of the world”.\n\nBacha’s global expansion comes as coffee consumption is rising across Asia. In China, homegrown companies such as Manner Coffee and Luckin Coffee are fighting Starbucks and Tim Hortons for market share, while in south-east Asia, the Philippines’ Jollibee Foods and Indonesia’s Kopi Kenangan are battling for dominance.\n\nBacha, which launched in 2019, differentiates itself with glittering shops and ornate packaging inspired by the Dar el Bacha palace in Marrakech.\n\nBouqdib said the chain, which turned a profit last year of S$2.2mn (US$1.7mn) with revenues of S$95.5mn, was on track to double both of those figures this year and that there were no plans to list the company or to raise private equity funding.\n\nThe company does not have a store in China but sells its merchandise online through Alibaba’s Tmall. “We saw the demand for coffee gifting is just unbelievable. And next year, definitely, we are opening,” said Bouqdib.\n\nIn China, Bacha plans to open a sit-down café and retail outlet in Shanghai and a retail and takeaway store in Beijing, said Bouqdib, adding that “affordable luxury concepts have huge potential”, even in developing markets such as Indonesia.\n\nAnalysts said the expansion appeared rapid for a premium brand. “Opening 50 company-operated stores in one year is no easy task for any brand,” said Bernie Gao, China food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. “There is an inherent contradiction between high-end refinement and rapid expansion.”\n\nPremium stores often focus on perfecting details around the product, service and culture of stores, said Gao, adding that Bacha would confront steep competition in China.\n\n“The dominance of foreign chain brands has ceased to exist,” he said, citing “the rise in national pride among Chinese consumers along with increased trust in domestic brands”.\n\nBouqdib’s coffee venture comes after building TWG Tea, a luxury tea brand in Asia modelled after a French teahouse. Bouqdib formerly worked at Mariage Frères, a French gourmet tea company.",

    "blurb": "There has been just one debut since the city-state’s regulator approved the products in December ",
    "date": "2024-09-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Nine months after Singapore regulators approved the listing of active exchange traded funds, the city-state has seen just one product launch, with managers waiting for clearer signs of investor interest.\n\nThe more conservative investing habits of local investors, as well as unresolved gaps in Singapore’s ETF ecosystem and infrastructure, have also damped enthusiasm for the funds, according to industry participants.\n\nFrank Koudelka, Boston-based global ETF product specialist at State Street, said that trying to sell active ETFs in Singapore was likely to be a “grind” at this stage. But as in many other markets new to active ETFs, asset managers were still “testing the waters” to see if the products would gain traction.\n\n“It’s just in its infancy now, and firms are trying to figure out what’s my entry point, how much do I have to invest to get in there, who am I selling to, and are we seeing success with the existing products that are out there,” Koudelka said.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange gave the go-ahead for the listing of active ETFs last December, bringing the city-state into line with other jurisdictions in the region such as Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Indonesia and Japan.\n\nSingapore fund house Lion Global Investors subsequently launched the first such product in January in partnership with Japanese manager Nomura Asset Management, raising initial assets of S$37mn ($28.3mn). The Lion Global ETF has seen its assets inch up to S$49.2mn.\n\nSince then, however, there have been no further active ETF launches in the city-state, and no other products in the pipeline, the Monetary Authority of Singapore website shows.\n\nRival Asian funds hub Hong Kong has 28 active ETFs, with the first such product listing in June 2019, according to the Hong Kong stock exchange’s website.\n\nChen Wang, Hong Kong-based deputy chief operating officer at CSOP Asset Management, said asset managers in Singapore were still studying regulatory requirements as well as gauging market appetite.\n\nCSOP AM has a presence across the Singapore and Hong Kong ETF markets, with five ETFs listed in the former and 40 ETFs in the latter. This includes three actively managed money market products in Hong Kong.\n\nOne critical challenge with investors in Singapore is their lack of familiarity with active ETFs.\n\n“Local investors in Singapore, they still need a lot more time to understand what’s going on because the Singapore market is a relatively smaller market compared to the US or China or even Hong Kong, and investors tend to be relatively conservative in terms of their investment appetite,” Wang said.\n\nThere was still “a lot” of investor education that was needed to show them the difference between active and passive, and then also the benefits of buying an active ETF versus investing in a mutual fund, she added.\n\nWang did not say whether CSOP AM had any active ETFs in the pipeline for Singapore.\n\nIf there was a “clear interest in a certain type of ETF” from investors, CSOP AM could “move very fast to launch”, she noted.\n\n“We’re looking at new opportunities in the Singapore market all the time,” she added.\n\nEvonne Gan, Singapore-based engagement manager for asset management advisory at Broadridge, pointed out that investors in the city-state could access offshore active ETFs via private banking or online securities channels, so just looking at locally listed products did not give the full picture on investor appetite.\n\nLocally listed ETFs in Singapore recorded the highest outflows among all Asia Pacific markets between January and May this year, with cumulative outflows of $278.5mn.\n\nBut Gan was still optimistic that domestic interest in active ETFs would grow.\n\nThe Singapore bourse was “actively engaging” with issuers who had “strong capabilities in originating mutual funds to utilise ETFs as another conduit to reach a wider audience through a listed vehicle”, an SGX Group spokesperson said.\n\n“Active ETFs are a relatively new concept in Singapore, reflecting the evolving nature of the investment landscape here,” the spokesperson added.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

    "event_name": "Architect Leonard Ng: ‘Nature is beautiful, it doesn’t require design’",
    "blurb": "He helped make Singapore a garden city, and the same ethos informs the design of his home",
    "date": "2024-09-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "One day in 2000, Leonard Ng realised that banking was not his calling. Fifteen years as a proprietary trader at Singapore-based United Overseas Bank seemed more than enough. “There’s a shelf life to trading,” he says. “There’s really nothing much to show for your effort except the plus and minus of an accounts book.”\n\nHe looked around for inspiration. He had enjoyed spending time with an architect while commissioning a property in his native Singapore, and kept thinking of the Canadian prairies, where he had spent time as an undergraduate in Saskatchewan. A combination of nature and design felt alluring. So he changed tack and qualified as a landscape architect, taking courses at night while working at the bank. “One day I was head of the prop desk for bonds trading, and literally the next day I was an intern at the National Parks Board.”\n\nThe transition was tough, but his commitment paid off. Last year Ng was named Singapore’s President’s Design Award “designer of the year” — having previously won four “design of the year” titles. Collectively they recognise 16 years of involvement in making Singapore become a garden city, one of the greenest in the world.\n\nIt’s no surprise then, that we meet in the garden of Ng’s home, a light-filled two-storey house designed by local architects RT+Q, in Singapore’s Leedon Estate, a hilly pocket of luxury gated houses.\n\nThere is a deliberate lack of order to his garden: “I wanted to feel like you’re in a natural forest,” he says. “There are no straight lines here. The leaf litter is left on the ground and the trees are unevenly spread.” The garden is multi-layered, just like a rainforest: Borneo Kauri, Malayan Crape Myrtle and Umbrella trees create a canopy, epiphytes grow from the boughs at mid-level and Chinese Fan Palms dot the ground.\n\nPartly, this is a practical matter: “I wanted it to be a self-sustaining low-maintenance landscape. Being a landscape architect, I’m kind of picky, but I don’t really have a lot of time.”\n\nNg points out that the garden is grass-free — remarkably, this award-winning landscape specialist doesn’t own a lawnmower — and instead Ng has harvested and cultivated a tough and drought-tolerant local weed, and repurposed it into a resemblance of a lawn, flowing like a waterfall over a step.\n\nThe house itself is custom-designed to combine two dwellings, one for himself and his wife and children (15, 17 and 19), and one for his in-laws, separated by a central lift. Everything is open, with nature invited in: the big open-plan kitchen flows directly to the front garden in one direction and a pool area in the other. Hornbills are frequent visitors; so too are squirrels, who have a habit of stealing their fruit. The garden seems like an extra room, intrinsic to the home.\n\nA heavy wooden dining table is as curved as the garden, shaped to keep the natural characteristics of the tree it came from. A corridor is repurposed as a sort of unhidden shed; tools and a chainsaw hanging in neat order on the wall.\n\nNg has a passion for collecting antique searchlights sourced from old warships, admiring “the combination of industrial aesthetics, function of communication and illumination . . . and the history”. They stand in corners of rooms, adding to the industrial feel. His in-laws’ collection of life-sized bronze figures from the Qin and Han dynasties, by Chinese artist Cai Zhisong, also populate the house, reclining by a spiral staircase, standing like sentries near the entrance.\n\nUpstairs, in his home office, past a large master bedroom with a wooden ceiling fan more often seen in Singapore’s older, colonial-era homes, another passion is indulged: minerals and crystals, an interest Ng shares with one of his daughters. The crystals bloom from small boxes on shelves. Smaller plants thrive here under the attention of photographic lights of sufficient sophistication to impress the FT’s photographer. Ng works beneath a road sign saying Frankel Walk, a memory of his previous home on Singapore’s east coast; his family bought it in an auction when the signs were renewed.\n\nAs we wander through the house, Ng’s attention constantly turns to the plants within and around it. On the roof of the home gym, by the swimming pool, Ng points out hanging plants meshed into fabric on the roof; they reduce heat and the need for air conditioning. By the pool are Australian weeping tea trees, and in a separate Japanese-style garden area in his in-laws’ wing of the home, koi carp drift in a pond angled (by Ng) to create a sense of lengthened perspective. There are Swamp Sheoaks (casuarina glaucas — playfully known as Cousin Itt for their resemblance to the Addams Family character) draped on the ground like a carpet. Herbs grow in pots. Ng can name every plant in its Latin form; if we go that way, I tell him, the story is going to require quite the fact check.\n\nA series of pools leads visitors to the entrance and garden. This feels right, because from the very outset, water has characterised Ng’s approach to landscape design.\n\nSingapore has a close relationship with water, and not just because it is an island nation. As one of his first acts as leader, founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew elevated water to a national security issue; he recalled only too well the British surrender of Singapore in February 1942, forced, more than anything else, by the fact that the Japanese army had taken the reservoirs. “In most countries, water is a need, not national security,” Ng says. “But for us, it’s existential.”\n\n“It’s not like we have a large hinterland where we can collect water and supply ourselves. If there’s not enough water on the island, we are beholden to someone else.”\n\nSingapore has the best drainage in south-east Asia, to avoid floods when the tropical rains fall, and sophisticated mechanisms to ensure water supply. But to Ng, there is a greater possibility in water. Collecting water is only part of the challenge, he says. “Next we need to make sure [that] water becomes cleaner. And you do that by trying to change people’s mindset and their relationship with water.”\n\nNg first trialled this while working on the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park project, his first assignment for the German landscaping firm Atelier Dreiseitl — later known as Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl — after joining in 2008 (the firm was rebranded Henning Larsen in 2023, where Ng is country market director). This was a pilot initiative to combine rainfall collection, recycling, and the animation of public spaces. “And then hopefully the public will engage with these spaces, build a sense of ownership, and be less inclined to pollute the water source,” Ng says. That means cleaner water, less energy for recycling, “and it all comes together. It’s really not about designing the river so much as it is redesigning our relationship with water.”\n\nThis is particularly fitting in Singapore, he says, “where every square metre of land is really valuable to us. We cannot afford to have mono-functional uses.” A canal, say, cannot be just for drainage, but also supply and recreation. “So instead of having one function, now there’s three functions. That’s why we design in layers.”\n\nBishan was, and remains, enormously important to Ng. “When I’m out in Bishan park and see people playing and laughing and having a good time, chasing the butterflies and really appreciating it, that really validates the effort.”\n\nThis thinking is visible in many of his later projects: the water play areas at Jurong Lake Garden; the multipurpose model of the Kampung Admiralty building, where the community is bonded through a multi-tiered roof garden filled with local plants. It will be central to his next major assignment, creating mixed-use shared spaces above a 21.5km tunnel network called the North-South Corridor.\n\nAll of these principles are clear in Ng’s home: the interplay of physical structures and nature, the idea that a house and the gardens around it are one and the same. There is a symbiosis here: his work as a landscape architect informs the place he lives, and his home in turn informs his work.\n\n“This is my sanctuary,” Ng says. “After a day of stress you come back and you feel energised. You go out to the greenery and you get inspired to come up with new ideas.”\n\nAnd those ideas are informed by the plants around him. “Nature is inherently beautiful,” he says. “Nature doesn’t require design, and the best we can do is learn from it. But even if we can only produce a poor facsimile of nature, how do we do that in an authentic and faithful manner? That’s what I strive to do as a designer.”\n\nChris Wright is a contributing reporter for the FT, Singapore\n\nSingapore Design Week runs from September 26 to October 6\n\nThis article has been amended.

    "body": "This article is part of FT Globetrotter’s guide to Singapore\n\nIn workaholic Singapore, late dinners are common practice with people putting in extra hours. And even if you have burnt through your three meals a day, a final round of food and drinks with friends is always popular, especially given the plethora of eateries that remain open well into the evening.\n\nTypically, supper fare here is likely to be fried, toasted or grilled over a hot stove. Dishes range from a plate of crispy roti prata — an Indian-style pancake served with a side of fish curry, which is offered by many late-night food stalls — or a serving of Chinese-style noodles flash-fried in a wok and dripping with gravy.\n\nI lean on the side of living dangerously and prefer to risk putting on a few extra pounds if it means I can dig into a plate of prata, topped with generous amounts of sugar and soaked in curry. So if you are in Singapore, here are some places where you can get your fix if hunger pangs suddenly strike at odd hours. Beyond the food itself, some of them are also interesting spots in which to greet the early hours.\n\nAbove this supper spot, there used to be a neon sign for “Rolex Mee Master Tan Kue Kim”. Mee is a term that locals use to refer to noodles, and Master Tan, the late patron of Kim’s Famous Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee, was often seen at night frying up wok-fried delights for his customers. Tan, who died this year, was known for dishing plate after plate of fried noodles in the Chinese Hokkien style. His capable assistants have since taken over the kitchen.\n\nWhile one may question the wisdom of donning a luxury timepiece worth thousands of dollars in a greasy kitchen, but the charismatic Tan made it his calling card, as you can see in the articles about the restaurant plastered proudly across the walls.\n\nThe noodles are a calorie-laden adventure, coated in a savoury prawn-infused seafood stock, with shredded egg, squid, shrimp, deep-fried cubes of pork lard and sambal (chilli paste), accompanied by sliced lime on the side. The way to do it is to mix the noodles with the paste and squeeze out all the juice from the lime. For foodies looking for a late-night meal with some heat, this is a fine spot. Those not in the mood for noodles will find plenty of alternatives, from fried mussels to steamed fish head and crabs cooked a variety of ways.\n\nOrchard Road, the city-state’s main shopping street, is usually on the list of places to visit in Singapore. Café de Muse, situated on two floors of the Shaw House mall, is a useful pit-stop for those on a night-time buying spree. Shops typically close around 9pm, but this place remains open round the clock.\n\nThe café offers Korean-inspired Asian fusion food, with dishes such as bulgogi pasta — spaghetti cooked with slices of beef in a tangy-sweet sauce — and kimchi fried rice. Western fare is also available, from duck confit to chicken roulade, as well as lighter dishes such as Caesar salad and a range of teas and coffees.\n\nThis café occupies a strategic location at the intersection of busy streets in Singapore’s Muslim quarter. It has some alfresco seating, which makes for a pleasant supper on a clear balmy night.\n\nKampong Glam Café specialises in Singaporean Malay comfort food such as nasi goreng pattaya daging, or fried rice with beef, hidden under a thin egg omelette drizzled with sweet chilli sauce, and nasi lemak — coconut-flavoured rice paired with fried chicken, egg, cucumber, deep-fried crispy fingernail-length anchovies and a glob of sambal.\n\nTry a cup of hot or iced teh cino, which is an extremely sweet tea and milk drink loosely based on cappuccino. For something more refreshing, go for teh o limau, sugary black tea infused with chunks of lime.\n\nIf you pick the right seat, you can have a fabulous view of the golden dome of the Sultan Mosque, the centrepiece of the Muslim quarter. This is a popular tourist spot, so it is maybe not the place for a relaxed meal.\n\nThose with a passion for motoring will probably find this supper spot right up their street. The Fujiwara Tofu Concept Shop is modelled after the Japanese street-racing manga series Initial D, which has an avid following and was made into an Asian action flick in 2005.\n\nIts façade looks as if it has come straight out of the comic, bearing the same name as the tofu store operated by Bunta Fujiwara, the father of Takumi Fujiwara, who is the main protagonist of the series.\n\nNo visit is complete without ordering a side of the titular Fujiwara tofu, deep-fried and topped with mildly spicy chilli. The store mainly serves finger food, from Japanese scallop sashimi to skewers of barbecue-glazed yakitori chicken thigh — ideally paired with a pint of Sapporo beer, or rounds of soju and sake.\n\nFans of Japanese-style izakaya dining are likely to feel at home here. But the real attraction is the cars that pull up to this eatery on a regular basis — the type of exotic motors often seen in posters on young petrolheads’ bedroom walls. Their drivers like to live out their Initial D fantasies by using the café as a backdrop for photos, although ironically parking spaces are limited.\n\nSimpang Bedok is a legendary location for late-night food in eastern Singapore. It is not one restaurant, but a collection of places concentrated in one area offering a range of different cuisines.\n\nHere you will find the Bedok Market Place, sited above a supermarket, where a variety of stalls serve up quick eats showcasing Singapore’s street- food culture. These are fine for dinner, but the market largely closes after 9pm. Surrounding the supermarket is a cluster of eateries where locals head for real supper food. These close later, after midnight, while some are open around the clock. One of the latter is the Indian-Muslim New Mahamoodiya Restaurant, located across the street from the Bedok Market complex. It has a seemingly endless menu of roti prata — Indian-style pancakes, prepared in a variety of ways. Roti prata paired with curry is a favourite supper dish with locals, and you can choose between sweet or savoury, stuffed with anything from egg to cheese to mushroom, or just on their own with the curry.\n\nRoti prata is a crispier version of naan flatbread, and New Mahamoodiya’s creations are known to pack a crunch. One of the crunchiest is “tissue prata”, thin fried dough twisted into a shape resembling a wizard’s hat, and coated in sauces from caramel to honey and condensed milk.\n\nWash it all down with “Milo dino”, a cloyingly sweet chocolate-based drink topped with cocoa powder and sprinkles. Food at Simpang Bedok is greasy, sugary, spicy heaven.\n\nWhere do you go for late-night food in Singapore? Tell us in the comments below. And follow FT Globetrotter on Instagram at @FTGlobetrotter",

    "body": "I was born in Finland but, when I was three, my dad’s job transferred the family to Singapore, where I spent my childhood and grew up. My parents were both very interested in tennis, which was quite a big and relatively accessible sport in Singapore. I started playing when I was about six years old and, quite quickly, I noticed that, “OK, this is something that I’m actually quite good at.” Tennis became a full-time job on the side of school — I travelled all around Asia, playing in tournaments.\n\nIt is quite a hectic and stressful lifestyle. Most days would be packed with morning training, then I’d go to school and then, in the evening, training again. On weekends, I’d play tournaments. It was a lot of work. You sacrifice a lot; you don’t grow up as a normal kid. It’s not possible to go to late-night events or hang out with friends, because there is training the next morning, or travel for a tournament. But you also get a lot of opportunities.\n\nAfter I graduated from high school, I got a full athletic scholarship to play division one college tennis, for the University of Wisconsin in Madison. I studied economics and my days continued being similar, filled with training, but, on the weekends, I would travel to different universities. It was fun — tennis was what I loved.\n\nWhen the time came to look for a masters, I started thinking about leaving the US. I had been able to study there because of my scholarship, which paid not only my tuition but accommodation. Without it . . . university studies in the US are just so expensive. At the same time, I had started thinking about going back to my roots. I wanted to feel the Finnish side of me, as I had never really lived there.\n\nI knew I wanted an international university, where I could study in English. Then I saw that the masters in business and management at Hanken School of Economics offered a specialisation in marketing, which was a perfect fit for how I pictured my future.\n\nThe programme was two years long, with a mix of many different courses and a thesis at the end. It was a very international group and a good mix of those who had come straight from the bachelors degree, versus some who had already worked and came back to do their masters. Hanken was smaller than the average US university, which I liked, as it meant students felt part of a community. The classes, being smaller, meant there was plenty of space for group work and interaction with classmates and professors.\n\nThere were also a lot of chances to get involved in activities and clubs, so I co-founded the Hanken tennis club. I was part of the masters committee, which organised events and workshops for masters students, and the sports committee, which planned activities for students. There were a lot of opportunities to feel part of the community.\n\nMany of my favourite classes were marketing-related, but I also took a lot of finance and accounting classes to broaden my knowledge. Most interesting were probably strategic marketing and marketing communications, where we learn how to market across cultures. They helped give me a sense of which kind of marketing I wanted to do.\n\nMany people think marketing is essentially advertising, but there’s so much more behind it. For example: how can you grow an audience for a sport? How can you make the experience better for the fans? That’s essentially what I do now. I work for a company called Two Circles, in Bern, in Switzerland. We grow the value of sports, backed by data. We use data to understand sports fans to, for example, grow audiences, increase engagement or improve ticketing strategies. It combines my passion for sports with what I learnt at Hanken on the marketing side.\n\nThe main things I took with me from Hanken were soft skills from group projects and presentations that the small class sizes enabled us to have. I learnt how to work with people, to listen and learn from others — how to ask constructive questions and maintain a solution mindset. A lot of those skills came from being active in student unions.\n\nI want to keep working in the sports industry — I really enjoy it. And, one day, I think, I will want to return to Finland. My time at Hanken gave me time to get to know the country, and now Helsinki feels like home. I made a lot of friends there. I built a good base for when, in the future, at some point, I’ll want to move back.",

    "body": "A nondescript serviced office on the 24th floor of an anonymous block in Singapore might seem a curiously low-key place to base an affiliate of a giant Chinese mining conglomerate.\n\nBut in the case of Yuxiao Fund, a Singapore-domiciled Chinese company which tried to acquire control of military-use mineral assets in Australia, it was entirely deliberate.\n\nInstead of pursuing its interest in Northern Minerals, an Australian rare earths company, from their headquarters in China, the owners of mining conglomerate Jinan Yuxiao Group chose to set up a low-profile Singaporean entity.\n\nThe point of a Singapore domicile was that it changed the angle of attack. A bid originating from a neutral south-east Asian nation with a highly regarded legal system was intended to reduce suspicions in Australia over Chinese acquisitions in sensitive industries, analysts say. It is one of several strategies that Chinese corporations are using to adapt to a hostile world around them.\n\nUltimately, its attempt to raise its stake in Northern Minerals was blocked by an Australian government “wary of allowing a foreign entity, especially one with strong links to the Chinese Communist party, to control a critical national resource”, according to John Coyne, analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think-tank based in Canberra.\n\nBut Yuxiao Fund’s use of Singapore hints at a much bigger and more complex geopolitical trend. An intensifying rivalry between China and the US-led west is driving a fragmentation in the world’s economic order. Beijing, Washington, Brussels and other capitals have imposed a range of tariffs, export controls and other measures to protect their domestic markets and stymie competitors’ technological progress.\n\nIn response, company executives and analysts say, Chinese corporations are setting up shop in a host of relatively non-aligned third countries, hoping they can bridge the increasingly hostile gap that divides China from the west.\n\nThe prime motivation behind shifting investment into these relatively insulated countries — which include Singapore, Vietnam, Ireland, Hungary and Mexico, among others — has been to circumvent protectionist measures imposed by western powers against China-based companies.\n\nChinese investment is pouring into such countries, according to figures provided exclusively to the FT by the Rhodium Group, a research provider. But as more of China’s exports are rerouted through these jurisdictions, officials in the US and Europe are growing increasingly concerned about the emergence of back doors into their markets.\n\n“Global Chinese companies are definitely facing their most challenging time ever,” says Frank Pieke, professor at the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore.\n\n“But they are also much better equipped than in the past to meet these challenges. They are larger, more sophisticated and have much more to offer to the countries that they operate in.”\n\nChina’s emergence as an economic superpower over the past four decades has been propelled to a large degree by globalisation.\n\nOpen markets and free trade underpinned China’s long export boom and helped facilitate huge transfers of capital, knowledge and technology from the west to Chinese companies.\n\nMany have gone on to become world leaders in their sectors: examples include BYD and CATL in electric vehicles and batteries, Huawei in telecoms and ByteDance in social media.\n\nFaced with imported goods that are a match for their domestic incumbents in quality terms, and growing more concerned about national security issues, western powers have cooled on globalisation.\n\nAccording to a recent IMF study, trade and investment between two distinct blocs — one centred on the US and the other on China — have declined by more than within those blocs, especially since the onset of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe so-called connector countries are seeking to insert themselves between the two and are “rapidly gaining importance and serving as a bridge”, according to the IMF. Flows of trade with and investment in such countries have increased dramatically since the US, Europe and others began erecting trade barriers with China.\n\nFor Chinese companies, investing in such countries brings several advantages. One is access to large free trade areas with minimal tariffs and regulatory friction. Another is that domiciling in a new geography can allow Chinese companies to dilute or repurpose their identity, thus remaining below the trade flak flying between China and the US-led west, analysts say.\n\nSo marked is this behaviour in Singapore that it has earned a distinct name. “Singapore-washing” describes a process through which Chinese companies set up a subsidiary or reincorporate in the city state to mitigate the geopolitical risks and scrutiny often directed at China-based entities.\n\nChen Zhiwu, professor at the University of Hong Kong, says he is “always impressed by human ingenuity when it comes to responding to the rise of deglobalisation forces”.\n\n“As long as there are diverse political institutions among the nations on earth, some countries will try to offer a platform for globalised businesses to engage in cross-institutional arbitrage,” he adds.\n\nPerhaps the best known example is Shein, the fast-fashion group currently seeking a public listing in either London or New York. It originated in 2008 in the eastern city of Nanjing and its supply chains, warehouses and inventory remain in China.\n\nBut in 2021 its enigmatic founder Sky Xu, who also goes by the names Xu Yangtian and Chris Xu, relocated himself and the company’s headquarters to Singapore. Shein, valued at $66bn in its last private funding round, now defines itself as a “Singapore-headquartered global online fashion and lifestyle retailer”, according to its website.\n\nIt will still need approval from Chinese regulatory authorities ahead of its planned overseas listing, according to multiple people familiar with the situation. Beijing’s powerful Cyberspace Administration of China is also reviewing whether there is a risk that some of Shein’s data could fall into foreign hands.\n\nBut the company’s customers, business partners and potential investors will look at Singapore and see a respected jurisdiction providing a transparent pathway towards legal redress if things go wrong, analysts say.\n\nSingaporean identities are also sometimes used to access the market in India, skirting New Delhi’s clear antipathy towards Chinese investment. In a crackdown that started in 2020 after clashes between Chinese and Indian troops along their shared Himalayan border, India has banned more than a hundred Chinese social media, lending and other apps, citing data protection and privacy concerns. It has also launched several regulatory probes against Chinese tech companies.\n\nBut that has not stopped China’s Shunwei Capital — established by Lei Jun, the founder of smartphone maker Xiaomi — investing in Indian market automation platform WebEngage and dairy brand Country Delight in 2022. Those deals were done through SWC Global, which describes itself as the Singapore “affiliate of a leading multibillion venture capital firm based in Asia”.\n\nJoyy, a US-listed tech business with roots in China, has also recast itself as a Singapore-based global company after establishing an entity in the city state in 2021, according to corporate filings.\n\n“There is a track record of Singapore becoming a cover for companies with questionable ties to China and even the Chinese state,” says Ja-Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore and a non-resident scholar with Carnegie China.\n\nChina also has reservations about Singapore-washing. One senior Chinese official, who declined to be identified, says Beijing felt a sense of discomfort with the trend among certain Chinese companies to “de-Chinafy” when they set up offices overseas. “It raises questions of loyalty to China that some in Beijing find uncomfortable,” the person says.\n\nShein declined to comment.\n\nChong believes such concerns are mirrored in Singapore. “If there is an accumulation of such cases, especially companies with [Chinese Communist party] ties using Singapore’s preferential arrangements with other countries, or increasingly using their entities here to circumvent restrictions, this could end up with negative speculation and political risks for Singapore,” he says.\n\nJinan Yuxiao Group is a case in point. It has equity affiliations with the state-owned Chinese miner Shenghe Resources, says Mary Hui, a Hong Kong-based researcher on China’s industrial strategies and author of the a/symmetric newsletter.\n\nAs well as having stable relations with both China and the west, many of the group of third countries also tend to be members of free trade areas that guarantee access to large western markets at zero or low tariffs.\n\nSingapore and Vietnam are both members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a grouping of 15 Asia-Pacific countries that accounts for around 30 per cent of the world’s GDP. In addition, both have long-standing bilateral free trade agreements with the US.\n\n“Setting up in Singapore has a whole range of benefits for a Chinese company,” says the vice-president of one Singapore-based Chinese technology company, who declined to be further identified.\n\n“If we do business from China, we hit a wall of tariffs and suspicion over everything we want to do in the US market,” the executive adds. “From Singapore, there are no tariffs and the suspicion is much less.”\n\nSimilar considerations apply to Ireland and Hungary. Both are members of the EU, whose single market provides regulatory unity and zero tariffs across 27 member states and 450mn people. Tariffs imposed by the bloc on products imported from China do not apply if those same products are manufactured and sold inside the EU.\n\nIreland’s experience shows the clear commercial dividends that a country can reap from linking China and the west.\n\nBilateral trade with China has tripled in the past five years and there is a clear desire on both sides to increase investment, said Ireland’s then-prime minister Leo Varadkar as he welcomed his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang on a visit early this year.\n\nBig-ticket Chinese investments in Ireland include those from ByteDance, parent of the short form video app TikTok, WuXi Biologics, a drug company, Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment giant, and the Bank of China, a big Chinese state-owned bank. In total around 40 Chinese companies employing 5,100 people are clients of Ireland’s investment promotion agency IDA.\n\nIDA executives say the agency “definitely considers” TikTok to be a Chinese company. But TikTok itself is at pains to stress its non-Chinese credentials. Its spokespeople in Ireland said that the company’s international headquarters are in Singapore, while in Europe it is incorporated in the UK and Ireland and is subject to UK, Irish and EU laws, not Chinese ones.\n\nThey added that although ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing, remains TikTok’s parent, about 60 per cent of ByteDance is beneficially owned by global institutional investors such as the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group.\n\nWuXi Biologics said it “would prefer not to participate in a story focused specifically” on its country of origin. “We believe our impact is most accurately reflected as part of the collective achievements within Ireland’s vibrant life sciences sector,” the company added.\n\nHungary, another key country for Chinese investment in Europe, has notably warmer relations with Beijing than many others. On a visit to Budapest earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping described bilateral ties as being “as mellow and rich as Tokaji,” referring to a Hungarian dessert wine.\n\nHungary’s authoritarian president Viktor Orbán, the EU’s longest-serving head of government, praised China for loving peace and being an “important stabilising force” in the world.\n\nHungary received 44 per cent of all Chinese foreign direct investment in Europe in 2023, overtaking the ‘big three’ economies of Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by Berlin-based think-tank Merics.\n\nMexico is a member of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the successor to Nafta, which embraces 510mn people and accounts for another 30 per cent of the global economy.\n\nChinese companies have quietly gained a considerable foothold as investors in Mexico over recent decades. North America’s USMCA free trade agreement means Chinese businesses making everything from fridges and televisions to textiles in Mexico gain privileged US market access.\n\nAmérica Móvil, the telecoms group controlled by the billionaire Carlos Slim, relies heavily on Huawei technology. Mexican appliance and refrigerator manufacturer Mabe is 48 per cent owned by the acquisitive Chinese group Haier.\n\nOne in five cars purchased in Mexico last year was made in China, with half of those coming from Chinese manufacturers. Electric-vehicle makers such as BYD and Chery are now scouting Mexico for factory sites so they can export to the US and avoid tariffs on vehicles imported to the US from China, which rose to 100 per cent at the start of August.\n\nHowever, US patience with Mexico’s role as a tariff-free staging area for Chinese companies to the US market is already running thin. The US Trade Representative, which oversees America’s trade policy and negotiations, has also scolded Mexico over a lack of transparency in its steel and aluminium imports from third countries like China.\n\nBut some in Mexico City say China is too deeply embedded in Mexico to change course. In any case, there is only so much either country can do to limit China’s reach.\n\n“In Washington they’ve only just realised,” says Enrique Dussel Peters, director of the Center for Chinese-Mexican Studies at UNAM, the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “They think the discussion is: ‘on Monday I don’t want to see China in Mexico’.\n\n“That was maybe an option 20 years ago. Today it isn’t.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Kaye Wiggins in Hong Kong\n\nData visualisation by Keith Fray",

    "body": "Singapore’s National Day rally is traditionally an opportunity for the prime minister to outline domestic policy plans, but Lawrence Wong this year used his first address to sound an uncharacteristically ominous tone.\n\n“We have seen what happens in other countries when the broad middle falls behind,” said Wong, who took office in May as Singapore’s fourth prime minister and only the second not from the founding Lee family. “The centre does not hold. Societies begin to fracture and collapse.”\n\n“Do not assume this cannot happen here,” he added. “It can — and it will — unless we take decisive actions to prevent it.”\n\nWong’s warning this month reflected the government’s concerns about the political implications of rising living costs ahead of an election that must take place by November 2025 and will initiate a post-Lee political era.\n\nThe increased disillusionment of Singapore’s middle class, under pressure from high housing prices, threatens the fragile consensus that has underpinned the city-state’s growth and stability for decades, analysts said.\n\n“The top is not very big, but the middle is huge here,” said Gillian Koh at the National University of Singapore’s Institute of Policy Studies. “It’s core to [the government]’s interests to ensure there is a broad, strong, healthy, stable middle class.”\n\nEconomic sentiment has dominated public opinion. According to the latest quarterly survey in June by local pollster Blackbox Research, 52 per cent of respondents said cost of living was the issue that mattered most, followed by salaries and wages, at 16 per cent. Immigration, often a hot-button political issue in the city-state of 6mn, came in at just 5 per cent.\n\nSingapore is generally lauded as an economic success. It ranks fifth in the world in GDP per head, according to the IMF, trailing the likes of Luxembourg and Switzerland. And despite Singapore’s free-market reputation, more than 80 per cent of its resident population lives in public housing, according to government figures.\n\nBut not everyone has kept pace with rising prosperity. “Nobody in Singapore is going to die of hunger, but there are food insecurities,” said Robin Lee, chief executive of charity Food from the Heart, which in 2023 fed about 60,000 low-income individuals. “It is shocking for some people that in a country like Singapore we still have to do this.”\n\nHeading into an election, “definitely cost of living hangs in the mind”, he said. “It is really, really high, and even though wages are also high, it’s relative.”\n\nSingapore’s ruling People’s Action party — which has governed the tightly controlled country continuously since 1959 — is battling these economic challenges as it faces falling vote shares, including in the 2020 election, when the opposition made significant inroads.\n\nThe PAP’s dominance is such that even the opposition Workers’ party bridles at the suggestion of winning power. Its leader, Pritam Singh, demanded a correction to an April article in the Straits Times that suggested his party aspired to form a government, clarifying that its medium-term goal was merely to “play our part in ensuring at least one-third of parliament is not in the PAP’s hands”.\n\n“The WP seeks an evolution, not a revolution of our political system,” he said.\n\nWith the PAP all but certain to prevail in the polls — and Wong to remain prime minister — he faces the challenge of winning over a disenchanted electorate following a transition from the Lees.\n\nWong was tapped by the party after Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, stepped down as prime minister in May, having led the city-state since 2004. Lee Hsien Loong has stayed on in government as a senior minister and secretary-general of the PAP, following his father’s example.\n\nWong, who was principal private secretary to Lee Hsien Loong before holding a host of ministerial appointments, has highlighted his ordinary-man credentials, often referencing his non-elite schooling, in a bid to appeal to ordinary Singaporeans.\n\nHis rally speech included a series of handouts and populist pledges, including support for unemployed people to study or reskill, policies to maintain the affordability of public housing, improved shared parental leave and upskilling allowances covering 24 months of full-time training for Singaporeans aged 40 and above.\n\nThe 2024 budget announced in February also includes a S$1.9bn (US$1.5bn) expansion of the government’s cost of living adjustment system of vouchers, cash payouts and rebates.\n\nWong’s government has also pledged to develop an Islamic studies institute to support Muslim leaders and another to improve standards of spoken Mandarin — initiatives that reflect attention to maintaining harmony among Singapore’s multi-ethnic population, which is 15 per cent Malay, 7.6 per cent Indian and 75 per cent Chinese.\n\nWith a severe reliance on imports, Singapore has limited scope to reduce costs, but recent economic data has pointed to a brightening picture. Core annual inflation in July fell to 2.5 per cent, the lowest level in more than two years, while non-oil exports grew 15.7 per cent year on year, the first annual climb since January.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore, which Wong chaired until May, has maintained the currency’s strength around 10-year highs against the US dollar, partly to keep down the cost of imported goods.\n\nThis focus on affordability, more than tensions over foreign workers or balancing US-China geopolitical frictions, appears to be an imperative for Wong. “It is something the government needs to address very carefully,” said Robin Lee of Food from the Heart.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nAll Singaporeans benefit from the nation’s progress / From Ng Teck Hean, High Commissioner, Republic of Singapore, London SW1, UK",

    "body": "Singapore’s prime minister has warned that raising tensions between the US and China will have an impact on the city state’s economy and the broader region.\n\nLawrence Wong, who took office in May, said on Sunday in a national address that the “intensifying rivalry” between Washington and Beijing was Singapore’s single biggest geopolitical concern.\n\n“The mutual suspicion and distrust will continue”, affecting international trade, security and co-operation, he said. “As a small country, totally reliant on trade and a stable global environment, we are bound to be impacted.”\n\nSingapore’s trade-to-GDP ratio stood at 311 per cent in 2023, one of the highest figures in the world, according to the World Bank.\n\nWong said irrespective of who won the November presidential election in the US, “it’s clear that America’s attitude towards China is hardening. Meanwhile, China is convinced that America is trying to contain it and suppress its rise.” Both the Trump and Biden administrations have ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese products, which Beijing responded to with countermeasures.\n\nThe US provides much of Singapore’s military capability, while China is the city state’s biggest trading partner. Maintaining good relations with both is a priority for Singapore, but also an increasing challenge.\n\nWong also warned of a changing global manufacturing map. Where once developed countries outsourced production to cheaper locations in Asia, “that era is over”, he said, noting that the US, China and European countries wished to reshape supply chains in their favour.\n\nThe US and EU have both sought to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains, favouring nearshoring strategies: in 2023 the US bought more goods from Mexico than China for the first time in 20 years, according to the US Department of Commerce.\n\nSingapore, the world’s largest transshipment hub, has not yet seen an impact on its own role in trade — total container volumes in the first five months of the year were up 7.7 per cent year on year, according to the Maritime & Port Authority of Singapore — but the country is potentially vulnerable to supply chain realignment.\n\nThe National Day Rally speech is considered the country’s most significant annual political event, usually accompanied by domestic policy initiatives. Not only was this Wong’s first such address as prime minister, but it was likely to be the last before Singapore holds a general election, which must take place before November 2025, but is widely expected to be held earlier.\n\nSpeaking in Malay, Mandarin and English Wong focused on policies concerning education, families and public housing availability. He highlighted the need to keep Singapore’s multi-ethnic population cohesive and financially included.\n\n“We have seen what happens in other countries when the broad middle falls behind: societies begin to fracture and collapse,” he said. “Do not assume this cannot happen here. It can.”",

    "body": "Chinook helicopters crossed the Singaporean skies, flanked by Apache gunships, while German-made Leopard battle tanks paraded on the streets below and US-made F-16 fighter jets put on an air show.\n\nLast week’s exhibition, part of Singapore’s annual National Day celebration, offered a vivid display of the military assets of a country that according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute had the world’s third-highest military spending per capita in 2023. It ranked fifth in 2021.\n\nThis year’s parade, the first under new Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, takes place as rising geopolitical tensions and emerging cyber threats are pushing the city state to boost defence spending and rethink its traditional stance of preparation and deterrence.\n\nOn National Day, Wong warned that “tensions between the US and China continue to rise. For now, they don’t want to collide. But they are engaged in a strategic rivalry that can undermine peace and stability, especially in this region.” These were, he said, “powerful forces”.\n\n“They are what keep me awake at night,” he said.\n\n“A lot more can be done in hardening civilian systems and getting the population psychologically ready for disruption in case Singapore gets caught up in a power confrontation,” said Ja Ian Chong, associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nSingapore’s military strategy has long been encapsulated by founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew’s remark in 1966 that the city state should be a “poisonous shrimp” — small but hazardous for predators.\n\n“Ultimately Singapore is trying to deter coercion directed against the city-state, without really trying to project power very far outwards,” said Scott Harold, associate director of the Rand Corporation.\n\nIn a sign of an increased focus on defence, Singapore in February outlined a S$20.25bn (US$15bn) defence budget for the current fiscal year. That is a 13 per cent increase over the previous annual budget, although revisions in last year’s spending means the actual increase is 2.5 per cent. In 2014, the budget was S$12.6bn.\n\nSingapore has long sought to maintain friendly relations with both the US, an important non-treaty ally, and China, its largest trading partner. But that geopolitical balancing act is being tested in an increasingly fractious environment.\n\nOne proximate source of concern is the South China Sea, where China has made vast maritime claims that are disputed by countries including Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines, and where recent stand-offs have inflamed tensions.\n\n“South China Sea tensions are particularly unwelcome in Singapore because it has no territorial claims of its own there, but would inevitably get drawn into potential conflict,” said Jonah Blank, senior research fellow at the NUS and senior political scientist at Rand. “From Singapore’s perspective, there is no US-China conflict that would be anything but a disaster.”\n\nSingapore has been deepening military ties with the US, as Washington strengthens its security net in the Indo-Pacific region. Under a memorandum of understanding renewed in 2019, US planes and ships can pass through Singapore.\n\nBut Singaporean politicians have been careful to avoid outright criticism of China’s increasingly assertive regional posture. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in July, Singapore’s defence minister Ng Eng Hen said Beijing moving deeper into the South China Sea made “perfect military strategic sense . . . from their point of view”.\n\nMuch of Singapore’s military hardware and technology has been sourced from the US or Nato, an alignment that would make the city-state “dependent on the US or other western allies” in a US-China conflict, Chong said. In such an event, Singapore would be asked to provide transit for the US military — which China would pressure it not to allow, he added.\n\nSingapore’s defence strategy was still tilted towards conventional land capabilities, analysts said — an outdated focus when the city-state is only linked by land to Malaysia, an ally. “If there is going to be greater instability because of issues in the South China Sea and any potential conflict around Taiwan . . . Singapore is going to need to make sure its sea lanes and air routes are safe,” said Chong.\n\nSingapore has ordered 20 Lockheed Martin F-35s the most advanced fighter aircraft, which are set to begin arriving in 2026, as well as four Type 218SG Invincible-class submarines from Germany’s Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, which are expected to be operational by 2028.\n\nAt the same time, the US and Singapore are expanding their co-operation in emerging technologies.\n\nIn July, Ng and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin agreed to co-operate on data, analytics and artificial intelligence. Singapore is seeking to incorporate AI into military thinking: it launched a fourth branch of its armed forces, the Digital and Intelligence Service, in 2022, and has held defence exercises around critical infrastructure and digital attacks.\n\n“AI could also shape decision-making processes in military operations,” said Collin Koh Swee Lean, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, pointing to its potential to identify threats within the “constrained and cluttered maritime domain” near Singapore, which includes crucial lanes for global shipping.\n\nUltimately “there is recognition that a lot of the potential for conflict in future will involve key infrastructure that may not be physical”, said Chong.\n\nThis — rather than the tanks on display in the National Day parade — may represent Singapore’s future military priorities. “The calibration needs to be less land force heavy, more naval and air force,” Chong said.",

    "body": "In what were once wild jungle and palm oil plantations in southern Malaysia, the likes of TikTok, Nvidia and Microsoft are racing to install the building blocks of the digital economy: data centres.\n\nBillions of dollars are being invested in the state of Johor, just a few kilometres from Singapore, by companies taking advantage of cheaper land and more abundant energy for computer infrastructure while staying close to south-east Asia’s biggest financial centre.\n\nJohor’s fortunes may soon be more closely tied to those of its wealthy neighbour. Malaysia’s king, the motorbike-riding billionaire Sultan of Johor, is championing an effort to bind his state closer to Singapore in a single economic zone, expected to include tax breaks and smoother cross-border trade.\n\nThere is a model in China, where Shenzhen’s transformation from fishing village to tech megapolis started after it became a special economic zone (SEZ) on the doorstep of Hong Kong. Malaysia hopes that Johor can be as integral to the regional digital economy as Shenzhen has been to China’s manufacturing growth.\n\n“Johor could become the Shenzhen of south-east Asia,” said Tengku Zafrul Aziz, Malaysia’s investment, trade and industry minister. “The data centre industry can form the backbone of a broader transformation of the state into a high-tech manufacturing powerhouse.”\n\nThe boom in Johor gathered pace after Singapore, which has limited energy resources, placed a three-year moratorium on construction of power-hungry data centres in 2019. Johor spurred investment by cutting approval times from more than three months to as little as seven days.\n\nRobin Khuda, chief executive of AirTrunk, a data centre with facilities across Asia, said Malaysia had given the company its “smoothest” entry to any of its markets. The group planned to expand further in Johor, Khuda said.\n\nForeign investment into the state of 4mn people hit RM58.8bn ($12.6bn) in 2022 and RM31bn in 2023, compared with RM10bn in 2019, according to figures from Malaysian Investment Development Authority.\n\nJohor’s economic growth is expected to outpace national forecasts up to 2025, according to Mida.\n\nAt Johor’s Sedenak Tech Park, land prices have gone from about RM40 per sq ft a couple of years ago to about RM70 to RM80, according to Adi Yaacob, a senior manager for JLand Group, the developer. The group is part of Johor Corporation, the state development company.\n\nThe activity has pushed Malaysia to the top of the list of Asia’s fastest-growing data centre markets, according to a report by Cushman & Wakefield. The country has a development pipeline of 1.2 gigawatts of data storage capacity, an increase of 600 per cent in the next five years from its current 189 megawatts.\n\nMalaysia is predicted to make up the majority of south-east Asia’s data centre market in terms of capacity by 2035 thanks to its proximity to Singapore, according to Morgan Stanley research.\n\nThe next boost should come from artificial intelligence companies that want to build AI foundational or training models in Malaysia, according to Yeoh Seok Hong, managing director of YTL Power International. His company has struck a $4.3bn deal to build an AI data centre in Johor with Nvidia as a tenant — an agreement that involves a partnership in cloud computing and a supercomputer project. YTL Power’s share price is up more than 100 per cent this year since the announcement.\n\nMeanwhile, ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese owner, plans to invest about RM10bn to set up an AI hub in Malaysia, minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz said in June. The company is already an anchor tenant at three data centres in Johor. Microsoft has also been snapping up sites and recently acquired land in Johor to expand.\n\nAll of this is a prelude to the establishment of an SEZ with Singapore, which is due to be agreed this year. The push has gained momentum since the business-friendly Sultan of Johor, who has good relations with Singapore, became Malaysia’s king in January.\n\n“The current king is very pro-business and wants Johor to be successful. I think Johor needs something like [the SEZ] to move forward,” said Govinda Singh, an executive director at real estate consultancy Colliers International.\n\nBut he pointed to past problems between the two countries including stalled projects. A plan for a high-speed rail link between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur was abandoned after the countries failed to reach agreement.\n\n“The main difference [now] is the Johor king and [Malaysian prime minister] Anwar are really trying to get the economy up and running. There is willingness at national and state level . . . Can it last? You have to be a bit sceptical,” he added.\n\n“Ultimately I am not sure Johor can be successful without [the SEZ], even with the data centre boom.”\n\nMany wonder if the data centre surge will increase pressure on resources while not contributing many jobs. Malaysia still relies on fossil fuels, including coal, for most of its power. Many aspiring cloud providers have no plan for renewable energy.\n\nLiew Chin Tong, Malaysia’s deputy minister for trade and industry, said he was “uneasy” about some parts of the industry and wanted more stringent requirements for water and renewable energy use in data centres.\n\n“Finding the balance is what I am most concerned about. We also want to make sure data centres will generate spillover to the economy, such as localisation of equipment and parts as well as creation of jobs for Malaysians,” he said.\n\nStill, both places have become increasingly integrated. The two land crossings between Johor and Singapore, Woodlands and Tuas Link, are among the busiest and most congested border crossings globally.\n\nOne engineer working at US semiconductor giant Micron’s Singapore fabrication plant said he intended to buy property in Johor this year in anticipation of the SEZ. “I can afford a house in Johor as opposed to a tiny, expensive apartment in Singapore.”\n\nA SEZ would make Johor attractive to everyone from multinationals to young engineers, according to ​​Lee Ting Han, a member of Johor state’s executive council. “What I hope is that investing in Johor is one day regarded by everyone as the same as investing in Singapore.”\n\nJohor was always “regarded as the Wild West in Malaysia”, said Greg O’Shea, the head of Singapore and Malaysia for supply chain consultancy TMX Transform. “That is really starting to change.”",

    "body": "The risk of higher prices for everything from cars to smartphones for the world’s consumers just got a lot higher. Congestion at Singapore’s container port, which is at its worst since the pandemic, has started spilling over to neighbouring ports, posing a risk for global supply chains. Shipping rates have risen as much as fivefold over the past year and it is only a matter of time before some of that is passed on to shoppers.\n\nSingapore is the world’s largest transshipment hub: the container port connects more than 600 ports from 123 countries and has an annual capacity of 50mn 20ft equivalent units, a measure of volume. Things are getting serious when congestion from a hub of this size starts a domino effect for neighbouring ports.\n\nThat rare phenomenon is playing out this week with container ship congestion spreading to neighbouring Malaysia.\n\nOne explanation is that ships rerouting to avoid Red Sea attacks have led to bottlenecks in other Asian and European ports. Diversions have then meant more ships going through Singapore. Maersk, the world’s second-largest container carrier, for example, said it would skip two westbound sailings from China and South Korea this month owing to severe congestion. JPMorgan had estimated the Red Sea shipping crisis could add 0.7 percentage points to global core goods inflation for just the first half earlier this year.\n\nNow, another more unexpected problem could mean lasting disruptions to the global supply chain even when the Red Sea shipping crisis eases. The total volume of vessels, especially to and from China, has surged in recent months, and the annual peak shipping season has arrived earlier than expected.\n\nUS President Joe Biden unveiled tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports including chips, batteries, steel, medical products, electric cars and solar cells in May. Tariffs have also been proposed on other products such as ship-to-shore cranes. Companies have been rushing to secure inventory of these items before each of the tariffs go into effect later this year.\n\nAmong those hit will be automakers, which unlike other manufacturers of smartphones or smaller electronics, cannot shift their shipments to airfreight.\n\nSingapore’s ports are not the only danger spot to watch. The biggest US ports union suspended labour talks last month and has instructed members to prepare for a possible strike starting in October, threatening to create a perfect storm for global supply chains.\n\nA backlog of a similar scale in Asia during the pandemic resulted in higher prices for all kinds of products. The longer the shipping congestion lasts in Singapore, the higher the risk of another inflationary jolt for the world.\n\njune.yoon@ft.com",

    "date": "2024-07-0900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s state-owned fund Temasek has said it will prioritise US investments and be “cautious” about China after warning that its large exposure to the world’s second-biggest economy had hit its performance.\n\nTemasek, one of the world’s biggest state-owned investment groups, said on Tuesday that the value of its portfolio rose just 2 per cent to S$389bn ($288bn) in the year to March.\n\nWhile those figures lag behind a 28 per cent gain for the S&P 500 stock index over the same period, the rise was an improvement on last year when its value tumbled 5 per cent in its worst returns since 2016.\n\nGrowth from investments in the US and India was “offset by the underperformance of China’s capital markets”, Temasek said in its annual review. The MSCI China index was down 19 per cent during the same period.\n\nChina is Temasek’s third-biggest market after Singapore and the Americas, with 19 per cent of its portfolio tied to the country. The group has been one of the big beneficiaries of China’s growth over the past two decades with bets on technology giants Tencent and Alibaba and ecommerce group Meituan.\n\n“What we’d like to see is consumer confidence returning and spending going up” in China, Chia Song Hwee, Temasek’s deputy chief executive, told the Financial Times.\n\nHe said Sino-US tensions had altered its approach. “In the US we try to invest in companies that do not rely on importation from China. And in China, we invest in companies that do not rely on exports to the US.”\n\nChia also struck a cautious note on artificial intelligence investment. He said Temasek was “not in a hurry” to put money behind the AI boom and warned of “hype” in the industry.\n\nThe state-backed group did not plan to invest directly in OpenAI, he said, but added that people “should not be surprised” if it had exposure to the company through investments in venture capital funds. Temasek was in discussions to invest in OpenAI, the FT reported in March.\n\nChia said Temasek’s approach to early-stage AI start-ups was “to invest through VC funds who are much more nimble and they will build a portfolio around the space”, adding: “We will probably do direct investments on the back of what we learn from that.”\n\nTemasek said last year it was “disappointed” with its $275mn bet on failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX. It was forced to write off its stake after the company collapsed, prompting a rare backlash from investors.\n\n“When there’s a lot of capital coming into any area one needs to be watchful,” Chia said at a press conference, identifying “the AI hype” and the boom in private credit as two areas of exuberance.\n\nTemasek said the US would continue to be “the largest destination of our capital” outside Singapore. It said it would increase its focus on India, Japan and south-east Asia, markets that have benefited as global investors seek to cut their exposure to China as growth slows and geopolitical tensions rise.\n\nTemasek praised the performance of London-based bank Standard Chartered, despite chief executive Bill Winters in February describing its share price as “crap”. Temasek is the lender’s biggest shareholder.\n\n“I think the operating performance actually improved quite significantly” over the past three years, said Connie Chan, Temasek’s head of financial services.\n\nTemasek has over the years shifted from public equities to private markets, increasing its allocation to unlisted assets to 52 per cent of its portfolio as of March from 20 per cent in 2004.\n\nWhile it benefited from a private equity boom, executives have warned that funds face the prospect of lower returns as rising interest rates have hit its debt-fuelled model.\n\n“Low interest rates, with a lot of leverage to make acquisitions, drove some part of the returns in the private equity space,” said Alpin Mehta, head of real estate and deputy head of private equity fund investments at Temasek.\n\n“But even if you had to take that and strip that off, I think the returns are still fairly attractive.”",

    "date": "2024-07-0300:00:00.0",
    "body": "One of my favourite spots to walk past in Singapore is what my daughter calls the “red car house”. Nestled on a corner in one of Singapore’s richest neighbourhoods, the house in question is actually a grandiose mansion with at least six red Ferraris and Lamborghinis parked outside.\n\nOwned by a wealthy local businessman, the house is well known in Singapore. It is so opulent that it features in a Crazy Rich Asians-inspired tour of the tiny, island city-state, based on the popular 2018 film.\n\nThe Hollywood hit was an invaluable marketing vehicle for Singapore and a gamble by its tourism board and film commission. Both threw their weight — and an undisclosed sum — behind the movie. The gamble paid off. After the film’s release, Singapore experienced a record number of tourists and enjoyed a wave of global attention.\n\nNow, however, Singapore is trying to play down the movie and the image that it presents. A reputation for high living and expensive business costs have become a sensitive topic for locals ahead of the next general election.\n\nThe city, one of Asia’s main financial centres, has been ranked the world’s most expensive for nine of the past 11 years by the annual Worldwide Cost of Living survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nSingapore wants to convince locals and expats otherwise. “What does it really cost to live in Singapore — the world’s ‘most expensive’ city?” ran a recent article from one of the government agencies. This dismissed “familiar tropes”, including “over-the-top mansions in Crazy Rich Asians, the infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands and incredibly expensive cars”.\n\nThe government’s arguments are not all that convincing. Cost-saving advice includes not having to buy seasonal clothing because “it’s summer all year round”. There are also promises of 45c cups of coffee (I am yet to find this deal) and the ability to rent government housing, held up as proof that the city is not “necessarily as expensive” as London or New York.\n\nFor some, the city’s extravagant reputation is still a bonus. Philip Choo, who was inspired by the book to launch the city’s first Crazy Rich Asians tour in 2014, says he is still enjoying high demand from customers, especially from the US.\n\nBut a spate of recent news stories has reinforced the cliché of foreigners living lavish lifestyles and pushing up costs for everyone else. In May, 35-year-old Chinese citizen Wang YunHe was arrested in Singapore for allegedly running one of the world’s largest cyber crime computer networks. According to the indictment, his possessions included a luxury apartment in the city’s glitzy Orchard shopping district, a Ferrari F8 Spider and a number of Patek Philippe watches.\n\nThe result is that more Singaporeans are questioning government schemes that have enticed the rich to live here. One example is the family office regime. There are now more than 1,400 single family offices — funds that manage a family’s wealth — in the city-state, compared with 50 in 2018.\n\nManu Bhaskaran, an economist and chief executive of consultancy Centennial Asia Advisors, told me that Singapore’s rising costs were the product of government policy. The “business model brings in foreign investors who bid up rents, wages, and other service costs . . . The family offices are an example — how much extra revenue do they generate for the rest of us?”\n\nPerhaps aware of such sentiment, another government article has proclaimed that Singapore’s high cost of living is limited to wealthy expatriates. It claimed city ranking calculations include “products such as brand name raincoats and foreign daily newspapers” not typically purchased by Singaporean households.\n\nSingaporeans are unimpressed. “Not sure why they cherry picked two items and said it’s not relevant to Singaporeans,” wrote one Reddit user. Another observed that the difference might lie in the suggestion that locals should have different expectations to foreigners. “It is only expensive for expats because the average Singaporeans are not supposed to aspire for the finer things in life.”\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nExtravagant claims about Singapore are clickbait / From Ng Teck Hean, High Commission of the Republic of Singapore, London SW1, UK",

    "body": "Temasek has been backing a wave of international dealmaking by some of its biggest companies as the Singaporean state-owned investment company faces pressure to boost returns from its S$382bn (US$282bn) portfolio.\n\nThe global investor has been an influential “behind the scenes” supporter of major mergers and acquisitions by companies it has stakes in, including Singtel, ST Engineering, Singapore Airlines and Sembcorp Marine, said two people familiar with the transactions.\n\nMore such deals encouraged by Temasek, whose profits form a major source of revenue for the government’s national budget, are in the pipeline, one of the people added.\n\nWhile Temasek has become a consequential investor in public and private markets globally, Singapore-based companies still comprise 54 per cent of its portfolio. It was formed in 1974 to own and manage the shares and assets of the government. By comparison, GIC, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, invests outside Singapore and manages the nation’s foreign reserves.\n\n“Temasek is trying to supercharge the animal spirits of its Singaporean companies to make them more global and have better growth prospects because that [helps] its own bottom line, especially as a general election looms,” one of the people said.\n\nMany of the companies involved were struggling with low growth prospects or flagging share prices, they added.\n\n“I would not say Temasek are forcing it . . . because being an activist investor is not their style, but there is certainly a message through greater engagement that they would like portfolio companies to lean in. They have been strongly supportive of this M&A activity behind the scenes,” they said.\n\n“There has been pressure from the government for some time to boost returns,” said another person familiar with the situation. “We are going to see more of this [deal activity].”\n\nTemasek declined to comment. The company said publicly this year that more engagement with portfolio companies had created a “value uplift north of S$10bn”.\n\nThe focus on dealmaking follows Temasek reporting one of its worst annual results in recent times for the year to March 2023. The company reported a 5.07 per cent drop in shareholder returns, its poorest performance since 2016. The group slowed its investment pace for the period, calling it “the most challenging year for markets” in the past decade.\n\nTemasek is owned by Singapore’s finance ministry. Lawrence Wong, who became Singapore’s prime minister last month, has also been finance minister since 2021.\n\nTemasek’s one-year total shareholder return has been negative for two of the past four years. However, the state group prefers to cite growth over the longer term, reporting in 2023 a rise of 7.7 per cent over three years and 6 per cent over 10.\n\nAnother person close to Temasek said conversations about its returns with the government were “no more than the usual” pressure to improve them during a period of prolonged global economic uncertainty.\n\nRecent deals involving Temasek-backed companies include telecoms provider Singtel, in which it is the majority shareholder, leading a $1.75bn investment this month in digital infrastructure business ST Telemedia Global Data Centres — another Temasek-backed company. Singtel’s share price is trading at its highest since 2022.\n\nIn March, Singapore approved the merger between Tata-owned Air India and sister airline Vistara, a joint venture between Tata and Temasek-backed Singapore Airlines. The deal has been touted as strengthening the national carrier’s presence in the fast-growing Indian market once it completes in 2025.\n\nLast year, Sembcorp Marine finalised a merger with Keppel Offshore & Marine, forming one of the world’s largest energy operations and maintenance engineering companies. Temasek, the majority shareholder of Sembcorp Marine, was “strongly behind” the deal, one of the people said.\n\nTemasek has also struck some of its own deals. The fund sold liquefied natural gas trader Pavilion Energy to the oil major Shell this month for an undisclosed sum, although the fund had valued it at $3.63bn in March 2023.\n\nLetter in response to this report:Singapore state investor’s long-term strategy / From Lena Goh, Managing Director, Public Affairs, Temasek, Singapore",

    "body": "Welcome back. Today we focus on a story that gives a window into the push to clean up the vast global shipping industry — and the tensions and dilemmas that can plague national efforts to ride the waves of the energy transition — with Mercedes Ruehl’s report from Singapore.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the world, it’s been a mixed season for sustainability-related resolutions at shareholder meetings in the US. We digest some of the key numbers.\n\nHave a great weekend — we’ll see you on Monday. — Simon Mundy\n\nSingapore’s beaches and coastal parks have been unusually quiet in recent days. The city-state’s southern coastline became a sea of black after a dredging boat hit a bunker vessel on June 14, spilling more than 400 tonnes of oil into the ocean.\n\nThe pungent kerosene smell has hit inhabitants of the mostly man-made resort island of Sentosa, which many billionaires call home. A clean-up is under way but could take months to clear fully.Singapore is an integral part of the global shipping industry given its strategic geographic location. It is one of the biggest and most important hubs in the world for bunkering — that is, supplying ships with fuel.But the latest oil spill highlights the risks of being a bustling port. The Singapore Strait is one of the busiest sea lanes in the world and remains vulnerable to oil spill accidents such as the June 14 incident. As Singapore strives to maintain its position in the industry by becoming a leader in green bunkering, the transition could expose the city to further risks.\n\nGreen bunkering involves supplying ships with alternatives to fossil fuels, such methanol and ammonia. These substances come with far lower carbon emissions than the petroleum-derived fuel oil used by most marine vessels, but are highly toxic if spilled into the sea. A 2022 study led by the Environmental Defense Fund found that an ammonia spill could have more severe impacts on fish than an oil spill of comparable size, though it would not persist for as long in the environment.The world’s first voyage using ammonia as a shipping fuel, conducted by Australian miner Fortescue Metals Group, departed from Singapore in May. The city carried out the first ship-to-containership methanol bunkering for Maersk last year. The government said last month it is ready to offer full-scale commercial operations for the bunkering of methanol as a marine fuel.The commercial benefits to Singapore of being a green bunkering hub are obvious. Bunker sales of biofuel blends increased to 520,000 tonnes in 2023, more than triple the 140,000 tonnes in 2022. Total business spending by key maritime companies overseen by Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore hit more than S$4.8bn (US$3.5bn) in 2023, up from S$4.3bn one year earlier.\n\nThe International Maritime Organization, the UN’s maritime body, is set to introduce stricter emissions rules for the shipping industry — which accounts for 3 per cent of global carbon emissions annually — from 2027. Companies globally are testing the uses of methanol, ammonia and hydrogen to comply with some of these new rules.\n\nSingapore is putting money behind the green push, too. The Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint, launched in 2022, was established to support the development and commercialisation of new technologies, with $300mn committed to initiatives over the next decade.The MPA is working with the industry and investment community to fund start-ups in this space, with some S$68mn raised for 116 start-ups as of the end of 2023. The MPA and the Singapore Maritime Institute gave S$19.3mn in funding to universities and research institutes in 2023 for maritime R&D in smart ship development and green tech.However, trialling these new fuels — which also include green hydrogen — opens Singapore up to potentially more accidents, as well as lucrative business. It does not take many incidents such as June 14 to move public opinion on the matter. Studies on the effects of an ammonia or methane leak still are ongoing, but there are already concerns in the industry over their potential dangers to both humans and marine ecosystems. Singapore may hope the risk is worth the reward. (Mercedes Ruehl)\n\nThis year’s shareholder meeting season is nearing its close, and some interesting trends are already visible in the data. Check out this chart using data from investor intelligence firm Georgeson, showing proposals voted on as of June 20 at companies in the Russell 3000 — an index designed to include the biggest 3,000 listed companies in the US.\n\nThe number of shareholder proposals related to social issues has continued to climb, with notable upticks in resolutions around artificial intelligence and health issues. In contrast, governance- and environment-related proposals have declined slightly, despite an increase in resolutions around biodiversity.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s been a steep rise in proposals against the environmental, social and governance agenda, doubling so far this year from the same period of 2022.\n\nBut if we look at rates of support for these resolutions, we see a different story:\n\nThere’s much more support for governance-related proposals than for other categories, with environmental and social proposals suffering a steady decline in backing. This chimes with complaints from major asset managers about a rash of climate-related proposals that they consider inappropriately restrictive of company management.\n\nInvestors are clearly far more damning in their response to anti-ESG resolutions, which have had an average support rate of just 2.3 per cent so far this year.

    "blurb": "Like many other countries it has underestimated how demand is going to expand in coming years",
    "date": "2024-06-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singaporeans are a competitive bunch. One of the must-know Singlish words for those living in the city-state is kiasu. The Chinese Hokkien term roughly means a fear of missing or losing out and often refers to someone trying to get ahead of others. “Fomo on steroids” is how one Singaporean friend describes it.\n\nOne of the best places to see this in action is the queues at lunchtime around stalls of the city-state’s favourite hawker food markets. Another area to observe the kiasu mentality in the Asian financial centre is in business, such as foreign investment.\n\nSingapore made a surprise announcement last month that it would free up more power for data centre expansion. The move came as the chief executives of Nvidia, Google, Microsoft and others have been swinging by neighbouring Malaysia — and other countries in south-east Asia — in recent months pledging billions in data centre investment.\n\nIn Malaysia alone, the tech groups — three of the top four biggest companies by market capitalisation globally — have committed $8.5bn in new data centre, cloud and artificial intelligence investment in the past six months. Which is why more than one Malaysian government official joked that Singapore’s decision to court more data centres was a “typical Singapore kiasu response” to its neighbour’s progress.\n\nOf course there is some competition between Singapore and its neighbours, especially Malaysia from which it gained independence in 1965. But it is overly simplistic to dismiss Singapore’s move as kiasu-ness — even if there is an element of that at play. The city-state is already hyper connected and one of the biggest data centre markets in Asia — a trend that accelerated as Hong Kong became a less favoured destination for data centres and undersea cables. It is one of the top submarine cable hubs globally, with connections to 25 active subsea cables and more to come. None of that will change soon.\n\nThe decision to increase data centre capacity last month was a surprise to many because the government imposed a more than three-year moratorium on new data centres between 2019 and 2022. The proliferation of the energy-guzzling facilities had been consuming a substantial amount of Singapore’s resources. That ban helped push data centre companies into nearby Johor, the Malaysian state just across the causeway, and to a certain extent Batam, a close-by Indonesian island.\n\nThe conundrum Singapore faces now — like many other countries — is that it grossly underestimated how demand for AI is going to expand the global market for data centres in coming years. The city-state has made little secret of the fact that it wants to be the AI hub for south-east Asia, if not the top in Asia.\n\nThat’s because being such a hub brings other economic benefits. For example, as part of Nvidia’s data centre investment in Malaysia, the company will partner with local conglomerate YTL Power to develop the country’s fastest supercomputers using Nvidia’s AI chips. Microsoft last month unveiled landmark AI infrastructure investments in Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nSingapore realises it cannot ultimately compete with its neighbours for land and power. The key is how to complement it. The reason Johor is popular with global tech giants from ByteDance to Nvidia and Microsoft is because it is just a few kilometres away from hyperconnected Singapore.\n\n“Both Johor and Singapore can benefit from the data centre boom. They complement each other,” says Rangnath Salgame, chair and chief executive of Princeton Digital Group, an Asian data centre company based in Singapore but expanding in Johor. It is a “symbiotic relationship”, he adds.\n\nAnd as more and more companies diversify supply chains away from China that puts Singapore in pole position. One way it can benefit is by promoting a Singapore + one strategy, whereby companies establish a headquarters in the country to leverage its international business environment, free trade agreements and access to professional talent, but then have their manufacturing — or data centre — facilities in places such as Johor.\n\nThis is already a long-term trend. Singapore was the top recipient of inward foreign direct investment flows in south-east Asia between 2013 and 2022, according to the latest data published by the bloc. In 2022, Singapore attracted $141bn of FDI, accounting for more than half of the region’s total. So should Singapore really be kiasu?\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com",

    "date": "2024-06-1400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore has refused to renew the visa of the US-born chief executive of heavy-duty shipping company Red Box Energy Services after the company was designated by the US Treasury for breaching sanctions on Russia.\n\nPhilip Adkins, who co-founded Red Box and moved the group’s headquarters to Singapore, told the Financial Times that authorities in the city-state had denied him a work visa, in effect forcing him to step down.\n\n“I maintain the company was always compliant with all applicable international sanctions and it is my understanding my former colleagues are actively engaged with Ofac to delist the vessels — but in the meantime I am unemployed and I am no longer the CEO of Red Box,” Adkins said after the Singapore Ministry of Manpower’s decision on the visa.\n\nRed Box was placed under sanctions by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, an enforcement agency of the US Treasury, in May following an FT story on an audacious journey by its two main ships — the Audax and Pugnax heavy-lift vessels — from China through the ice-bound Northern Sea Route across Russia’s northern shore.\n\nThe vessels delivered large structures to Murmansk in northern Russia, the biggest city in the world above the Arctic Circle, to be used in a liquefied natural gas project that is under construction and the subject of sanctions.\n\nAdkins argued at the time that the structures were “simple steel frames” that did not breach sanctions. Industry experts said they appeared to be modules critical to the development of Russia’s Arctic LNG 2 project.\n\nThe UK added Red Box to its sanctions list this week. The US said last month that designating Red Box demonstrated “the United States’ continued resolve to constrain the Arctic LNG 2 project’s production and export capacity and limit third-party support to the project”.\n\nAdkins, who was born and raised in the US, has not himself been placed under sanctions. He says he holds a passport for St Kitts and Nevis. But the Ministry of Manpower can exercise a large degree of influence over those working in the city-state through its visa system.\n\nThe ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal Singapore business hours.\n\nAdkins’ early career was as an investment banker, including helping to fund Disney movies during a long spell in Japan. He went on to run a brewery in Australia before entering the shipping industry in 2007 as chief executive of Netherlands-based Fairstar Heavy Transport, before launching Red Box.\n\nHe said he was now based in Hong Kong, where he has permanent residency. Red Box also has offices in Rotterdam.\n\nThe Audax and Pugnax vessels are capable of carrying structures weighing 20,000 tonnes and are reinforced to allow them to traverse ice-covered waters. They played a crucial role in the construction of Russia’s Yamal LNG project, which launched in 2017.\n\nBoth vessels were also designated by Ofac in May.\n\nAdkins said that a lot of banks and other third parties had “overreacted” to the sanctions regimes and that was making business more “challenging”.\n\n“There’s a certain amount of embarrassment and disappointment that comes with no longer being the CEO,” Adkins said. “But I accept the consequences of the sanctions, even though I don’t agree with them.”",

    "date": "2024-06-1100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore Airlines is offering initial compensation of $25,000 to some of the passengers on a flight from London last month that suffered severe turbulence, leading to one death and multiple severe injuries.\n\nThose with injuries requiring long-term medical care have been offered an advance payment of $25,000. For those who suffered minor injuries in the May 21 incident, the airline has offered $10,000. The carrier said in a social media post on Tuesday that it had sent the offers to passengers on June 10.\n\nA law firm representing some of the passengers said it was advising everyone to seek legal advice before signing anything with Singapore Airlines.\n\n“Our working theory remains that this incident could have been avoided and therefore some fault lies with Singapore Airlines,” said Peter Carter, director of Carter Capner Law.\n\n“Our team, which includes very experienced airline captains, believes there is evidence to suggest that the aircraft flew through the top of a thunderstorm or in proximity to one as it passed over an area notorious for thunderstorm activity in the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone.”\n\nSingapore Airlines responded: “We regret that we are unable to comment on the views of other lawyers. SIA is fully co-operating with the relevant authorities in the investigation into this incident.”\n\nEarlier, the airline said it had invited those who sustained more serious injuries “to discuss a compensation offer to meet each of their specific circumstances when they feel well and ready to do so”.\n\n“Passengers medically assessed as having sustained serious injuries, requiring long-term medical care, and requesting financial assistance are offered an advance payment of $25,000 to address their immediate needs. This will be part of the final compensation that these passengers will receive.”\n\nThe airline confirmed it had also given passengers S$1,000 (US$740) for immediate expenses following the flight. It said it would provide a full refund of airfares to all passengers, including those who did not suffer any injuries.\n\nOne person died and dozens were hurt, including suffering severe spinal and brain injuries, when Flight SQ321 from London to Singapore experienced sudden, extreme turbulence over the Irrawaddy basin in Myanmar. The flight was diverted to Bangkok.\n\nThe aircraft dropped 178ft in under five seconds, with passengers experiencing rapid changes in g-force, or vertical acceleration, according to a preliminary chronology of events compiled by Singapore’s Transport Safety Investigation Bureau, the US National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing.\n\nThe flight underwent an “uncommanded” increase in altitude and airspeed while the autopilot was switched on, which the report said was most likely due to the aircraft being hit by a rapid upward movement of air, which lifted it more than 360ft.\n\nOverall the incident lasted just over a minute before the flight returned to its planned altitude.\n\nTurbulence, already the leading cause of non-fatal injuries in on-board accidents, is becoming more common and severe as global warming affects weather patterns and the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe preliminary report, based on data from the aircraft’s “black box” flight recorder, said it was probably flying over an area of developing convective activity at 37,000ft when the turbulence hit. Convective weather usually refers to thunderstorms or developing clouds. A probe by the Transport Safety Investigation Bureau is ongoing.\n\nNews of the Singapore Airlines payouts came after an Austrian Airlines aircraft on Sunday suffered such severe damage from a hailstorm that its nose cone was torn off and the cockpit windows were severely damaged.\n\nThe aircraft, flying from Palma de Mallorca, encountered the storm shortly before arriving at Vienna’s Schwechat Airport. The airline, part of Germany’s Lufthansa Group, said in a statement that the aircraft, including the cockpit windows, aircraft nose and coverings, had been “damaged by hail”.\n\n“The aircraft encountered a thunderstorm cell during approach to Vienna, which according to the cockpit crew, was not visible on the weather radar,” the airline said. The airline said all passengers on the flight were unharmed.\n\nThe crew of the flight — carrying 173 passengers and six crew — issued a Mayday call because of the extent of the damage, the airline said, adding that the flight had landed safely in Vienna.",

    "date": "2024-06-0700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore has convicted the final person in a record S$3bn ($2.23bn) money laundering case that cast uncomfortable scrutiny on the Asian business hub’s embrace of foreign wealth and put pressure on its clean reputation.\n\nOn Friday, Wang Dehai became the last of 10 Chinese nationals arrested in the case last August to plead guilty and was sentenced to 16 months in prison.\n\nThe investigation, which was linked to online gambling in Asia, involved island-wide raids and the seizure of gold bars, expensive wines, crypto assets, designer handbags and luxury cars, as well as the arrest of the 10 individuals — including one who jumped out of a second-storey window in an attempt to escape police.\n\nThe investigation rocked Singapore, which prides itself on its strong anti-money laundering regime and clean reputation, and prompted questions over how those involved operated for years while splashing their wealth in the city-state.\n\nSentences for the individuals convicted in the case have ranged from 13 to 16 months in prison and a number have been deported to countries including Cambodia and Japan. One had his sentencing adjourned to Monday and will probably receive a 17 to 18-month sentence.\n\n“The public has the perception that the sentences seem lighter or not aligned with the charges put forward given the sums involved and given the case itself is unprecedented,” said Suang Wijaya, a partner at law firm Eugene Thuraisingam. But he added the prosecution considered other aspects, including the state resources saved by the accused pleading guilty.\n\nThe more than S$3bn of assets seized in the case belonged to 27 people, with 17 still at large outside the country, according to police. The individuals who were apprehended held passports from a range of countries — many with golden passport regimes — including Cambodia, Vanuatu, Turkey, St Kitts and Nevis, Dominica and Cyprus.\n\nHowever, all were later identified as originating from Fujian province in China and also held Chinese passports.\n\nInvestigators in the case had asked several banks, including Malaysia’s CIMB and Citigroup’s local subsidiary, to provide documents. Police also took control of millions of dollars held in accounts with Credit Suisse and Bank Julius Baer by one of the suspects and questioned real estate agents and precious metals dealers.\n\nSingapore’s government said last year it might impose anti-money laundering controls on luxury assets, including cars, watches and handbags and also increase scrutiny of mushrooming single family offices — funds which manage private wealth — as a result of the scandal.\n\n“The length of the sentences meted out in individual cases might look short relative to the eye-popping total sums of money laundered, S$3bn, but are actually in line with legal precedent in similar white collar cases in Singapore,” said Remy Choo, a white-collar defence lawyer and managing director of Singapore law firm RCL Chambers Law Corporation.\n\n“The discrepancy between public perception and legal reality arises because the underlying offences for illegal online gambling occurred overseas, and the prosecutions in Singapore were not brought to prosecute those underlying offences,” Choo added.\n\nEugene Tan, associate professor of law at Singapore Management University, said the convictions and resulting deportations, as well as the asset forfeitures, had been obtained “without a long drawn-out court case”.\n\n“All these took place in under a year, ensuring that state resources can be better deployed elsewhere,” Tan said.",

    "body": "Singaporean heritage shophouses are enjoying roof-raising demand. Private equity giant Ray Dalio’s family office has bought in. The wife of Alibaba founder Jack Ma has acquired several. The infamous Fujian Gang of money launderers from China and their alleged associates bought a whole portfolio.\n\nComparable to brownstones in New York’s Brooklyn or properties in London’s Soho, the Singaporean colonial buildings have been fetching record prices as they get snapped up by family offices, billionaires and local developers.\n\nLocated on prime land, exempt from the hefty taxes foreign buyers must pay to buy residential property and with a finite supply of roughly 6,700, commercial shophouse sales surged to an all-time high of S$1.9bn ($1.41bn) in 2021, according to data from Knight Frank, with the trend continuing in 2022.\n\nAnd while sales by volume dropped in 2023, they remained above pre-pandemic levels. So do prices. Shophouses in the city centre have been selling for S$5,000-S$6,000 per sq ft — in some cases as much as S$8,000, say estate agents. That is comparable to recent deals by Prada or Gucci’s parent company Kering on New York’s Fifth Avenue — among the world’s most expensive retail spaces.\n\nThe new owners want top tenants. Coach, Dior, boutique hotels and Michelin star restaurants are opening inside shophouses. “Shophouses were one of the only asset classes whose value continued to rise even during the pandemic,” says Yap Hui Yee, a director at estate agency Savills, pointing to the prestige of owning a part of Singapore history.\n\nThen, last August, Singapore police unveiled a S$3bn money-laundering investigation — the city-state’s largest ever — involving individuals suspected of links to illicit online gambling from mainland China. Along with gold bars, luxury cars and handbags, the so-called Fujian Gang and their associates had also bought shophouses with the allegedly laundered funds.\n\nSome gloriously ornamented shophouses are still gathering dust as they wait to be sold to recover bank loans as part of the investigation.\n\n“I see shophouses now as having a pre-AML (anti money laundering) period versus a post-AML period. It has affected transaction volumes . . . although prices are holding firm,” Yap says.\n\nThe money-laundering case, along with rapid gentrification, has reinforced to many people the need to nurture a rich seam of Singaporean heritage.\n\nThe Singapore shophouse was not always in such high demand. It has come a long way from its roots in ancient China. The buildings started life as the homes of merchants and their families in the 1840s. The archetypal shophouse had the shop premises on the ground floor while the family often occupied the rear of the building and the rooms on the floors above. They were built with front verandas contiguous with their neighbours. In a city prone to sudden tropical thunderstorms and harsh sun, this created a continuous covered walkway along which to stroll. They were still being built until as late as the 1960s.\n\nWhen Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in 1965, shophouses were on the way out. Entire streets of them were demolished to make way for glittering new office blocks and shopping centres. It was only in the 1980s that the government had a shift in attitude towards old buildings, culminating in the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Conservation Master Plan of 1989. This involved gazetting city centre neighbourhoods — including Chinatown — as historic and conservation areas.\n\n“Many people, including within the government, felt a lack of connection to the past and the country becoming sterile. So the government stepped in,” says Clemence Lee, an executive director at property company CBRE.\n\nEven so, it is only in the past decade or so that shophouses have become hot property. Local developers such as 8M Real Estate, Clifton Partners and others started buying commercial shophouses to reinvent them into boutique hotels and jazzy bars and restaurants. Their upper storeys became especially popular as a more unique office space option than the usual skyscrapers.\n\n“When I started buying shophouses in 2014 they were undervalued,” says Ashish Manchharam, the founder of 8M Real Estate, adding that they were “under-appreciated and seen as cheap space”.\n\n“Places like Soho in London were using heritage space in creative and imaginative ways, I wasn’t seeing that in Singapore,” says Manchharam, who has since sold his stake in 8M.\n\nAmong 8M’s projects is boutique hotel 21 Carpenter, a block of four adjoining shophouses that was once a remittance house for early immigrants. The hotel merges past and present: for example, the rooms incorporate quotes from letters immigrants wrote home to family members.\n\nInvestor demand for shophouses as a defensive asset class soared during the pandemic — “even for me now the prices are pretty expensive”, Manchharam says. At the same time, draconian new laws imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong lessened the latter’s appeal as an international business hub, making its longtime rival Singapore a natural alternative.\n\nAlready a stable, low-tax and business-friendly destination, Singapore experienced record inflows of capital from family offices and wealthy individuals — especially from China — eager to park money in a safe place. New investment schemes, such as single family office regimes, helped shift the global centre of gravity for the world’s wealthiest towards the city-state. The number of such offices, which manage and invest a single family’s private wealth, exploded from just a handful in 2018 to more than 1,500 by the end of 2022.\n\nMuch of this new capital found its way into property. Foreigners’ ability to buy residential landed property in Singapore is limited to certain areas with certain permissions, so the appeal of commercial shophouses grew, especially freehold ones. A boost to dealmaking came from government action. In April 2023 it doubled the additional buyers’ stamp duty (ABSD) for foreigners from 30 per cent to 60 per cent as part of measures to cool the housing market. Most shophouses are zoned commercial so foreigners do not have to pay the higher fees associated with residential purchases.\n\n“A decade ago you could buy a shophouse for S$5mn-S$8mn in the city centre but now you are looking at S$15mn-S$20mn per shophouse,” says Mary Sai, an executive director at Knight Frank specialising in shophouses, citing their exemption from both ABSD and sellers’ stamp duty.\n\nThat changed in August last year when Singaporean authorities arrested and charged 10 individuals, all holding Chinese passports, with money laundering. In December, 10 shophouses owned by two Chinese nationals with alleged ties to one of the accused were put on the market by DBS bank to recover repayments of its loans.\n\n“There has been a slowdown from August onwards due to the money-laundering situation and more stringent checks,” Sai says. Sales of commercial shophouses fell to S$95mn in the final three months of 2023, a 70 per cent drop on the same period the year before and the lowest quarter in 13 years, according to agency PropNex. High interest rates, which increase the cost of mortgages, have also contributed to the slowdown.\n\nHowever, many longtime tenants in heritage and tourist areas have still had to pay much higher rents or move because of new landlords who want to see a return on the millions of dollars they paid.\n\nSingaporean Aileen Tan has seven or eight businesses located around culturally rich Kampong Glam in heritage shophouses, including the popular Blu Jaz café. The area borders Little India and is known for its textiles shops and local cuisine eateries as much as its bars and cafés. She has been trying to engage government authorities to help shield tenants and protect communities.\n\n“Money from wealthy foreigners is going into shophouses and there has been a lot of flipping for profits and it is affecting tenants,” she says. Tan is on her third landlord for a property that she rented two years ago. She is worried about the increase the latest owner will want for her upcoming renewal.\n\nTan has been doing business in the area for 20 years, working with other tenants in encouraging live music or getting local artist friends to paint murals on the sides of shophouses along the famous Haji Lane. But the mix has changed, and new tenants such as photo booths and souvenir chains do not care about the heritage aspect of shophouses, she argues.\n\nThe slowdown in the market for shophouses presents an opportunity, say local industry players, to think about the role shophouses should play within communities. More institutional owners and landlords are expanding efforts to showcase the buildings’ heritage value. In 2020, for example, the wealthy Spanish Portabella family acquired a residential shophouse on Neil Road with the intention of donating it to support research and training in conserving shophouses.\n\nFang Low, founder and chief executive of Figment, works with owners of commercial and residential shophouses, encouraging them to “bring back the soul” to shophouses by working with artists and other creatives, often converting them back to residences. One of his projects has been repurposing shophouses that became karaoke bars and massage parlours in one of Singapore’s former red light districts. “Shophouses were homes to begin with and people forget you can live in these.”\n\nLow grew up in a shophouse and returned from overseas alarmed at the “copied and pasted” urban landscape of condominiums and government housing blocks. “We work with mainly foreign families but I am seeing more local Singaporeans now as appreciation grows for shophouses’ heritage,” Low says.\n\nOne such Singaporean is Andy Lim, of JL Family Office, who says he got into the shophouse market “by chance” during the pandemic. He bought one shophouse, now home to his family office on Club Street, in 2020, and a another across the road in 2021 — even as prices continued to rise.\n\n“I realised there was a lot more history in this space than in the real estate I had been doing. In school I never learnt anything about this heritage,” Lim says.\n\nSuch owners are willing to pay the higher prices that shophouses now command. Lim’s second shophouse cost S$26mn, compared with S$21.8mn when it last sold in 2018. But rather than renting the second property out to the highest-paying tenant, Lim has kept the space free for the public to use as a “social impact hub”. Community groups are among those that use the building for minimal cost, with Lim giving up roughly S$500,000 in annual market rent.\n\nVivienne Soon, director of Breezeway Development, which owns multiple conservation shophouses, says on balance having brands — it hosted a pop-up by Coach in one of its shophouses — brings in more of the public to shophouses. But the company also charges an under-market rental for some heritage or cultural tenants.\n\n“It feels churlish to say this because we, like many others, have enjoyed a meteoric rise in capital values, but I worry about gentrification at breakneck pace,” says Soon. “Pure gentrification is not a great story for heritage.”\n\nAnother local group that has been buying is Meir Collective, a Singaporean real estate investment and management company. Sebestian Soh, who returned from a stint in London with a newfound appreciation for the beauty of Singapore shophouses, convinced his father, a property developer, to invest family money in the market in 2018.\n\nAs well as buying, selling and conserving heritage real estate — Meir now has a portfolio of 21 shophouses — Soh and his team help owners manage their properties including giving conservation advice. Soh’s first shophouse purchase is now home to his family office.\n\nSoh says that while the market has taken a pause after the money-laundering investigation, and as some properties are sold to pay back loans, he expects demand will recover. But he hopes companies like Meir can help the flood of new shophouse owners appreciate their value to Singapore.\n\n“It can be tough to navigate the government’s planning controls. But it is important to work together as shophouses become increasingly institutionalised,” he says. “Before there was Singapore there were shophouses. Everything else is new. But if everything is new and sterile, we have nothing.”\n\nMercedes Ruehl is the Financial Times’ Singapore and South-East Asia correspondent\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow @FTProperty on X or @ft_houseandhome on Instagram",

    "body": "Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio’s family office has bought two multimillion-dollar “shophouses” in Singapore, as billionaires snap up the heritage properties in the city-state.\n\nThe Dalio Family Office, which announced it was moving into the Asian financial hub during the coronavirus pandemic, purchased two shophouses on Club Street in 2021 for roughly S$25.5mn (US$18.9mn), according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal.\n\nFamily offices — private wealth managers set up for rich individuals — have exploded in Singapore from a handful in 2018 to about 1,400 in 2023. They have invested in Singapore real estate, with shophouses a popular choice. The properties sometimes stand empty or are used as offices, residential buildings or business premises.\n\nA development approval issued by the government at the end of 2023 for the site at 44 and 46 Club Street lists Tan Mae Shen, the Singapore managing director of the Dalio Family Office, as the developer.\n\nRenovation of the properties is due to finish early next year, according to the application, and the company has started hiring on LinkedIn. The Dalio Family Office is also expanding in Abu Dhabi after the billionaire stepped away from his hedge fund.\n\nA spokesperson for Dalio declined to comment. Rawlinson & Hunter, a London-based professional services firm named on the ownership documents, also declined to comment.\n\nSingapore is home to nearly 60 per cent of family offices in the Asia-Pacific region, according to KPMG. The family office of Google co-founder Sergey Brin has also set up a branch in Singapore, alongside many rich Chinese families.\n\nThere are about 6,700 shophouses with conservation status in Singapore. The buildings, whose design was introduced by Chinese immigrants in the 1800s, doubled as the business premises and living accommodations of early merchants in the former colonial outpost.\n\nZhang Ying, the wife of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, in January paid about S$45mn for three adjoining shophouses on nearby Duxton Road, according to documents lodged with the government. Zhang is also a Singaporean citizen.\n\nSales of shophouses hit a record S$1.9bn in 2021 with the average price of a property rising from a range of S$5mn-S$8mn to S$15mn-S$20mn over the past decade, according to real estate consultancy Knight Frank.\n\nThe consultancy said the doubling of the property stamp duty for foreigners to 60 per cent last year on residential purchases fuelled interest in commercial shophouses among family offices, since the properties can serve as part of their assets and as an office.\n\nHowever, both shophouse sales and the rate of openings of new family offices have slowed since last August’s S$3bn money laundering investigation in Singapore. Some of the accused and their alleged associates were linked to family offices and acquired shophouses with the funds.\n\nIn response to the investigation, the Monetary Authority of Singapore tightened checks for family offices at the end of last year, slowing sales of the heritage properties.\n\nIn December, 10 shophouses owned by two Chinese nationals with alleged ties to an accused person in the money laundering case were put on the market by DBS bank to recover repayments of its loans.\n\n“Some, although not all, of those properties associated with the launderers are being sold and the market — especially foreign buyers — are waiting to see what price they fetch and to draw a line under the saga,” said one property agent who declined to be named.\n\n“But it has tarnished the shophouse market by association, so I expect sales to be lower this year.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Ortenca Aliaj in London",

Bangkok’s Samitivej Hospital said in a statement on Wednesday that as of lunchtime local time there were 20 passengers in intensive care. Nine patients had surgery on Tuesday and a further five were expected to undergo surgery on Wednesday.\n\n“The Transport Safety Investigation Bureau under the ministry of transport will conduct a thorough investigation,” Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in a social media post on Wednesday.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, the US government investigative agency responsible for civil transportation accident investigation, said in a statement on Tuesday it would also send a representative and advisers to help aid Singapore’s investigation, as the incident involved US company Boeing.\n\nThe agency said it has “long been concerned about turbulence-related accidents and incidents” in the social media post.\n\nBoeing said it is in touch with the Singaporean carrier and is “ready to support them”.\n\nFlight SQ321, which left London on Monday, diverted to Bangkok and landed on Tuesday afternoon after experiencing “sudden extreme turbulence” while flying over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar. There were 211 passengers and 18 crew on board the Boeing 777.\n\nTurbulence is a growing problem for airlines, and the leading cause of injuries on board passenger planes. It is expected to worsen because of climate change.\n\nSingapore Airlines has not provided details on whether the aircraft flew into storms or if the problems were caused by “clear air turbulence”, which occurs in seemingly calm conditions. Passengers were being served breakfast at the time of the turbulence and have described chaotic scenes of bodies and items being flung about the cabin.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday morning the airline said a relief flight carrying 131 passengers and 12 crew members who were on board the SQ321 flight had arrived at Changi Airport from Bangkok.\n\nTransportation to their homes or hotel accommodation was arranged for passengers travelling to Singapore, while those with onward connections were rebooked on alternative flights.\n\nAnother 74 passengers and six crew members from SQ321 remain in Bangkok. This includes those receiving medical care, as well as their family members and loved ones who were on the flight.\n\nTributes have poured in for Kitchen, a father of two who was travelling with his wife.\n\n“My deepest condolences once again to the family and loved ones of the deceased. I also hope and pray that those who are injured will recover and return home soon,” Wong said.",

AstraZeneca has a portfolio of the drugs, including Enhertu, which is currently manufactured by its Japanese partner Daiichi Sankyo and generated more than $2.5bn in sales last year. It is used for breast and lung cancer.\n\nAstraZeneca’s investment in its first fully dedicated ADC site underlines the importance of the drug category to its future business and is the first time the drugmaker has built a manufacturing presence in Singapore.\n\nAstraZeneca said on Monday that the move was supported by Singapore’s Economic Development Board but neither AstraZeneca nor the EDB disclosed what incentives it would receive from the Singaporean government. A person with knowledge of the deal said the package included tax exemptions and other government subsidies.\n\nConstruction of the site will begin this year, and the company expects it to be operational in 2029.\n\nSingapore, a small island city-state, has limited space, and in recent years has focused on luring foreign high-tech manufacturing with generous subsidies and tax incentives.\n\nThe country has more mature manufacturing facilities compared with neighbouring countries in south-east Asia such as Malaysia and Indonesia, and has benefited immensely from supply chain shifts as companies diversify away from China.\n\nCompanies including Siemens have unveiled big investments in Singapore in recent years, with the German group announcing a high-tech plant in the city-state last year. Taiwan semiconductor giant TSMC and its affiliate Vanguard International Semiconductor have had talks with the government about using the city as a manufacturing hub.\n\nSingapore is also close to some of AstraZeneca’s fast-growing markets in south-east Asia. Sales in the company’s emerging markets excluding China increased 24 per cent in 2023, making it AstraZeneca’s fastest-growing area.\n\nAstraZeneca said last month that it wanted to build separate supply chains for the US and Europe.\n\nPascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, said: “Singapore is one of the world’s most attractive countries for investment given its reputation for excellence in complex manufacturing.” He added that “antibody drug conjugates have shown enormous potential to replace traditional chemotherapy for patients across many settings”.\n\nThe announcement comes after AstraZeneca said in February that it would spend $300mn on a new facility in Rockville, Maryland, to make another form of advanced cancer drug and announced a $388mn investment in its manufacturing sites in Dunkirk, France, last week, as it meets demand for its medicines.\n\nThe update comes ahead of an investor day on Tuesday, when the British drugmaker will share more detail on its plans for investment by 2030.",

    "body": "When I was two or three, I went walkabout and wasn’t found until some time later at a local mall. What a close brush with disaster, readers will think. What a potential loss to English letters and the Clerkenwell restaurant trade. Relax. This happened in one of the safest countries on Earth. I got my infant meanderings out of the way in Singapore.\n\nA point gets lost in all the coverage of the island state as it changes leadership this month. Economic enrichment is Singapore’s other achievement. It comes below, and wouldn’t have happened without, the creation of order and cohesion where there had been communal strife. To quote its per capita income, which now tops that of the US, is to understate what has happened in a once-fractious Chinese-Malay-Indian society.\n\nSo, what can other countries learn from Singapore? Be small. If the US could hive off 320mn people and 99 per cent of its land mass, it would be an easier nation to mould. Second, have a maritime rather than continental setting. The likes of Bolivia are missing a trick there. Third, and foremost, get an individual of the calibre of Lee Kuan Yew as founder-leader. I presume there are headhunters for these things.\n\nAnd so on and so unhelpfully on. In the end, Singapore is too particular, too sui generis in both its assets and liabilities, to constitute a template. It has but one universal lesson: the importance of an open mind.\n\nThe podcaster Chris Williamson has an almost-great line. “If I know one of your views, and from it, I can accurately predict everything else that you believe, then you’re not a serious thinker.” As a quote, it needs some Wildean polishing. But it captures the single oddest thing about politics. From someone’s view on, say, Israel-Palestine, it is too easy to anticipate their opinion on public spending, on abortion, on Brexit, on net zero. A lot of people, even or above all the most educated, take their views from their peers as a kind of bundled software. This is what we might call irrational coherence.\n\nSingapore is a lesson in what can be done when this mental trap is avoided. If the mark of a thinking person is a having a weird mix of beliefs, the island has had a few among its policymakers. This is a high-income nation where most people live in public housing. It is a private-sector paradise where civil servants can earn a fortune.  It has an acute sense of independence from the west but uses English as the main language of instruction. Conservatives in Britain and America have tended to regard the island as proof of concept: look what stern laws and low taxes can do. (It was under President Reagan that LKY addressed the US Congress.) But the government involves itself in matters of identity to an extent that would make the same people flinch.\n\nThe Singaporean “method” has been to come at each question afresh. The result is a lack of pattern: a libertarian nanny state. Even the nation’s Freedom House score, 48 out of 100, shows how hard it is to categorise the place. (The UAE, to which Singapore is so often likened, scores 18. Switzerland, another expat hub, rates 96.)\n\nIt is difficult to examine each issue one faces on its merits. This isn’t, or isn’t just, laziness, but a need for the comfort blanket of a worldview and a like-minded tribe. In the west, I sense, politics has come to provide the fellow-feeling that might once have come from religion, large families or a homogeneous town. If Singapore, or at least its officials, have been able to resist this, perhaps it is because the very idea of groupism has such raw historical connotations there.\n\nThe press is full of “Whither Singapore?” articles this month, and fair enough. The country has to navigate the US-China rift without the helpful scale of other Asean nations. It flourished in a world order that is decomposing. (LKY’s all-too-prescient speech to Congress urged America to uphold free trade.) But the island’s ultimate advantage, and example to the world, was always inside the head. That rational incoherence isn’t so easily lost.\n\nEmail Janan at janan.ganesh@ft.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life & Art wherever you listen",

    "body": "Lawrence Wong has been sworn in as Singapore’s new leader, as the city-state charts a new path after decades of rule by the founding Lee family.\n\nWong, 51, is only the fourth prime minister of the Asian financial hub. He succeeds Lee Hsien Loong, who had led the tightly governed island nation since 2004 but announced he was stepping down last month.\n\nA US-trained economist who has been deputy prime minister since 2022 and who also serves as finance minister, Wong was sworn in on Wednesday evening at the presidential palace, completing the rare political transition.\n\nSpeaking after his swearing-in, Wong warned that Singapore was grappling with a “dangerous and troubled world”. The city-state had enjoyed 30 years of peace in the Asia-Pacific since the end of the cold war, but that “era is over”, he said.\n\nAs a small country with an open economy, Singapore would be affected by international conflict and rivalry, “marked by geopolitical tensions, protectionism and rampant nationalism”, Wong said in an often grim speech.\n\nWong’s succession was carefully choreographed by the ruling People’s Action party, which has governed Singapore continuously since 1959. Lee, who oversaw 20 years of stunning economic success for the country, will stay on in government as a senior minister.\n\nWong called the moment a “significant milestone” for the young country. “I am the first prime minister of Singapore to be born after independence [in 1965],” he said, adding he and other so-called fourth generation politicians would differ from their predecessors.\n\n“We will lead in our own way. We will continue to think boldly and think far. We know that there is still much more to do,” he said.\n\nAcademia SG, a collective of Singaporean scholars, welcomed Wong’s pledge to “maximise the combined energies, imaginations and strengths of all Singaporeans”.\n\n“The new team should reject the legacy of punitive and paternalistic responses to dissenting views,” the group said.\n\nOn the domestic front, Wong and his team will face increasing pressures over deepening inequality, higher living costs and unhappiness among the country’s local population with foreign workers, including expatriates.\n\nRecord capital inflows from greater China as well as countries such as India and the US have raised living costs and house prices.\n\nA financial hub and trading centre of just 6mn people, Singapore is reliant on overseas workers, from construction labourers to top-tier bankers. But the government has increasingly restricted the employment of foreigners to prioritise the local labour force.\n\nSingapore, which maintains friendly relations with both the US and China, is also navigating a more febrile geopolitical landscape in the Asia-Pacific region as a result of the superpowers’ rivalry.\n\n“We have to be guided by what is in Singapore’s national interest and do so in a way that is consistent and principled,” Wong said. “And that means from time to time, we will have to say things or do things that some countries may not be so happy with. It could be China one day, it could be the US another day.”\n\nLee’s departure raises the likelihood of a general election, which Singapore is due to hold by November 2025, coming this year. The PAP has in recent elections suffered a declining share of the popular vote, making the first contest with Wong at the helm a consequential test for the ruling party.\n\nWong, who as with every prime minister to precede him is ethnically Chinese and western-educated, became a member of parliament in 2011 after more than a decade in the civil service.\n\nDespite the carefully managed succession, Wong was not always the intended next leader. The PAP’s initial succession plans for Lee were thrown into disarray in 2021 after deputy prime minister Heng Swee Keat stepped out of the running. Wong was selected in 2022.\n\nLee’s departure also draws to a close his family’s leadership of the country. His father, the late Lee Kuan Yew, is regarded as the patriarch of modern Singapore, ruling from 1959 until 1990.\n\nWhen Goh Chok Tong, Singapore’s second prime minister, took over, Lee Hsien Loong was waiting in the wings as deputy prime minister before becoming leader himself in 2004.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nSingapore still coping with foreign policy vulnerability / From Khaw Wei Kang, Macau",

His late father, Lee Kuan Yew, regarded as the architect of modern Singapore, led the nation from 1959 until 1990.\n\nThe older Lee’s combination of economic planning, investor-friendly policies and openness to trade gave the nation some of the highest living standards in the world. Under the current Lee, it has flourished as a global financial centre. But Wong, a former civil servant, will take the reins as the city-state navigates a challenging geopolitical environment. Cracks are also emerging in its heavily state-directed society.\n\n“We punch above our weight in global affairs,” says Chan Heng Chee, a Singaporean academic serving as ambassador-at-large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But she warns against complacency. “The economic model is changing,” she explains, “shifting away from the globalising forces that helped make Singapore a success towards greater protectionism. Different times call for different leaders.”\n\nNot that Wong’s appointment signals a revolution. He has been preparing for a carefully choreographed transition since April 2022. Meanwhile, fissures in society have widened with a rising cost of living and greater inequality. Resentment of foreign workers, a large part of the city’s labour force, has increased while the PAP faces pressure to transform from an illiberal leadership to a more inclusive government. In addition, the US-China rivalry is playing out in neutral Singapore’s backyard, necessitating an ever trickier balancing act.\n\nWong, 51, comes from humble origins and did not attend elite schools. His father was born in China but moved to Singapore and his mother was a teacher. His political rise was swift. He served as Lee’s principal private secretary from 2005 to 2008, then led the education and national development ministries before becoming finance minister in 2021 and deputy prime minister in 2022. One person who knows him calls him “relatable, if a little uptight”.\n\nAs co-chair of the Covid-19 task force, Wong was associated with Singapore’s efficient handling of the pandemic. “It paved the way for his visibility with everyday Singaporeans for the first time,” says Linda Lim, a professor emerita at the University of Michigan, who knew Wong when he studied economics there. Yet it was not the public that chose Wong. Lim claims he was selected because he was acceptable to the largest group of people within the PAP, rather than for being a visionary. “He is a piece of the puzzle, but the party is still everything in Singapore,” she says.\n\nOthers are more blunt. “He wasn’t the first choice for many but he is close to the prime minister,” says one public servant who dealt with Wong as Lee’s principal private secretary. “Never did I think back then that he would be the next leader of Singapore.”\n\nDespite carefully curated videos of his guitar playing and enjoying local landmarks, Wong, who is twice married with no children, has remained relatively private. “He is not a natural politician, he is a technocrat by training and inclination and he will need to learn the cut and thrust of politics,” says Eugene Tan, a professor at Singapore Management University. “Right now, though, he still needs to prove he can rally not just the public but also his colleagues behind him.”\n\nDonald Low, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, has known Wong for decades and describes him as an “open-minded conservative” whose ability to adapt quickly is often underestimated. “He favours incremental over radical change, evolution over revolution,” he says.\n\nWong has stressed continuity and said there will not be cabinet changes until after a general election. Prime Minister Lee will stay as a senior minister. Others, though, would like to see more original policies. “In a more tumultuous world, will just some policy tweaks by the new leadership be enough?” says Ja Ian Chong, associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nBut first, Wong will need a mandate. The next general election is now expected as soon as this year. It will be a consequential poll, even though a PAP victory is all but assured. The party, which has governed since independence, earned one of its lowest vote shares in the 2020 election. The opposition Workers’ party meanwhile won the highest number of seats since independent Singapore’s first general election in 1968 and has repeatedly called for more inclusive governance.\n\n“This is the first time in independent Singapore history where the prime minister can no longer look to more advanced economies and say we just need to catch up,” Low says. Strong leadership with more participation from voices outside the PAP is needed, he adds. “The road map has to come from within. That is now Lawrence Wong’s challenge.”\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com",

    "body": "An octogenarian oil trader has been convicted of “cheating” HSBC and abetting forgery after a lengthy trial in Singapore, drawing a line under an oil dealing scandal that left banks facing hundreds of millions of dollars in potential losses.\n\nLim Oon Kuin, the 82-year-old founder of Hin Leong Trading, was found guilty on Friday of two charges of cheating HSBC and one of encouraging a Hin Leong contracts executive to forge a document. A sum of US$111.7mn was involved.\n\nHin Leong, one of the most powerful names in Asia’s oil trading industry, had been hiding losses from trading in futures markets and selling off oil inventories that had already been pledged as collateral for loans, according to legal filings.\n\nThe Singaporean tycoon will be sentenced in October and faces a maximum 10-year jail sentence for each of the three charges. He had become one of the city-state’s wealthiest people before his empire collapsed in 2020 as oil prices tumbled.\n\nWith its low corporate tax rates and stability, coupled with a location straddling the shipping lanes that connect China with global markets, Singapore has become one of the world’s biggest commodities hubs, competing directly with London, Geneva and Houston.\n\nBut the wrongdoing exposed at Hin Leong, along with other commodities trading scandals, have raised questions about the integrity of Singapore’s regulatory framework and its oversight of commodities trading houses.\n\nA high-profile accounting scandal in 2018 at commodities business Noble Group’s Singapore entity brought the business to the brink of collapse, while Japan’s biggest trading house Mitsubishi Corporation was forced to liquidate its Singapore unit Petro-Diamond in 2019 after a rogue trader lost more than $300mn through unauthorised transactions.\n\nHSBC and DBS, Singapore’s biggest lender, were among the bank creditors that provided trade financing to Hin Leong for years, with Lim originally being charged in 2020 after confessing to hiding US$800mn in losses and directing the company’s finance department not to disclose the losses, suffered in futures markets.\n\nHe also revealed he had sold a “substantial part” of the company’s oil inventories and used the cash as general funds, even though it was the subject of inventory financing agreements with banks.\n\nHe was later hit with more than 100 other charges, but prosecutors proceeded to trial on just three of them. Lim remains at liberty on a S$4mn (US$3mn) bail.",

    "date": "2024-05-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore is studying proposals to shake up its struggling stock market as the gap between the financial hub’s performance and other regional exchanges widens.\n\nSingapore Exchange (SGX) is reviewing a document from the nation’s venture and private capital association, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The Singapore Venture & Private Capital Association (SVCA) includes state funds GIC and Temasek, local and global venture firms, and buyout groups including General Atlantic, Warburg Pincus and KKR.\n\nDiscussions have been going on since the beginning of the year, the people added, and the SVCA’s proposals are also being considered by the government’s Economic Development Board, Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nThe government did not commission the document, but it has appeared as it discusses policy changes with SGX to boost the stock market. The two are responding to the next wave of south-east Asian companies — such as Singapore-based automotive marketplace Carro — opting for the US over Singapore to list.\n\nAmong the proposals suggested is mandating stock market participation from the record sums of private capital that have poured into the city-state in recent years, such as into family offices and other wealth management businesses.\n\nThere are also more politically sensitive suggestions, such as mechanisms allowing pension and sovereign money to be invested in the stock market as seen in Australia or Thailand, the people said. While Temasek invests in local companies, GIC, which manages the government’s foreign reserves, only invests internationally.\n\n“There has been a shift in thinking by the government that this is not just an SGX problem but important to Singapore’s national agenda. Is it possible to be a well-rounded and relevant international financial centre with an anaemic stock market? Perhaps not,” said an industry executive involved with the discussions.\n\nOne person involved in the document’s creation who did not wish to be named said they had “not seen an all-government and industry approach like this since Singapore first decided it wanted to foster a tech and venture capital industry in the late 2000s”.\n\n“For the first time, they seem more willing to consider more maverick, aggressive moves such as investing pension money — which is normal elsewhere but new for Singapore.”\n\nSGX chair Koh Boon Hwee, appointed last year, has been heavily involved and more willing to hear fresh perspectives, the people said. Koh, a business veteran in the city-state, has also chaired telecoms group Singtel, the city’s biggest bank DBS and Singapore Airlines.\n\nThe MAS said it “has received the proposals and is reviewing them”. SGX, the EDB and MTI declined to comment.\n\nSingapore has risen as a financial centre in recent years, boosted by a crackdown by China’s President Xi Jinping on the rival business hub of Hong Kong and record amounts of private wealth and capital flowing into the island state, regarded as a haven for its stability and business-friendly, low tax market.\n\nBut the government’s success in private markets has never flowed through to its stock exchange — even as more new economy and technology companies set up their headquarters in Singapore.\n\nSGX has been dogged by low volumes and questions over corporate disclosure practices. Delistings frequently outnumber listings. The bourse has a high concentration of businesses in which state investor Temasek has a big block stake, as well as asset-heavy companies such as real estate investment trusts that have languished in recent years amid higher interest rates.\n\nThe exchange was one of the quietest globally last year in terms of deals and funds raised, at seven and $300mn respectively, according to PwC research. Its poor performance has become starker with regional exchanges preparing for an initial public offering revival as global macroeconomic conditions improve.\n\nThe Indonesian stock exchange was among the top five exchanges globally by total number of IPOs in 2023. India recorded its highest number of IPOs since 2017 last year at 234, an increase of 56 per cent on 2022 while private investors are shifting more capital to it in preference to China.\n\nJapanese stocks last month broke a bubble-era record while Hong Kong Exchange has appointed new leadership as the city fights to maintain its status as a major financial centre.\n\n“There is a growing fear that even some private capital could leave Singapore in favour of being closer to those faster-growing markets, especially India,” said one Singapore-based venture capital managing partner consulted by the government and SGX.\n\nThe government has also been closely watching other countries’ policies, such as the UK dialling up the pressure on pension schemes to help companies grow, the people said. Like GIC, Singapore’s Central Provident Fund also has abundant capital. While retail investors can use their CPF money to invest in selected stocks, that does not move the needle in terms of volumes. There is no government policy that mandates or encourages CPF investment into equities at a broader level.\n\nAnother proposal includes more collaboration with south-east Asian stock markets, including the potential for Singapore to host a regional exchange down the track and underpin any issues such as currency risk.\n\n“Singapore trumpets that it is an ‘innovation economy’ but has a retirement system that is so risk averse. Building that liquidity might start to incentivise fund managers,” another person familiar with the talks said.\n\nOthers however questioned whether the latest attempt would be enough to turn around SGX’s trajectory.\n\n“Creating supply and demand is hard. They really need to be talking to market makers like local funds and asset managers and I still am not seeing that,” said one Singapore-based hedge fund executive.\n\nPrevious efforts, such as tie-ups with the Nasdaq and Tel Aviv exchanges to attract secondary listings, or a Spac regime being introduced in 2021, have failed to work.\n\n“It’s nice to have ideas and to make it part of the Singapore national agenda. But fixing poor disclosure practices, or strengthening corporate governance to give investors more assurance, remain the broader issues for us,” the hedge fund executive added.",

    "body": "Singapore has given international banks an unusual series of top-level briefings on geopolitics as it seeks to reassure them that the financial hub can remain stable and neutral at a time of rising tension between China and the west.\n\nIn meetings organised by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s office, officials discussed US-China rivalry, the Middle East conflict, the Ukraine war and the $2.2bn money-laundering scandal that rocked the city-state in August, according to four people with knowledge of the talks.\n\nThe meetings have been held over the past six months with US and European financial institutions including Citigroup and Standard Chartered as well as some local banks, they said.\n\nCo-ordinating minister for national security Teo Chee Hean, a top public official, led many of the discussions. Foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan, trade and industry minister Gan Kim Yong and minister for home affairs K Shanmugam, were also involved in some of the briefings, the people said.\n\nThe city-state has plotted a careful path as a neutral financial centre at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington and the briefings show Singapore’s determination to reinforce its neutrality after large inflows of people and capital from mainland China.\n\nOne attendee said the US-China tensions “featured heavily” in the talks and officials sought to correct a “misperception” that Singapore is tilting towards China. “They were trying to explain that Singapore is not neutral but is friendly with both and chooses according to its own interests depending on the situation,” they said.\n\nAnother person who attended a briefing said that the government sought to reassure those present that financial institutions were not going to face unnecessary regulation in the wake of a $2.2bn money laundering investigation, the largest in the city-state’s history.\n\nTen foreigners linked to China have been charged with money laundering and the financial regulator is probing whether lenders and other institutions took necessary steps to mitigate risks as part of the probe.\n\nBanks have since significantly tightened up scrutiny of clients, with approvals for setting up private banking accounts and new family offices in the city-state now stretching into months and in some cases more than one year.\n\nMinisters overall sought to emphasise Singapore’s safety, reliability and trustworthiness amid geopolitical uncertainty.\n\n“While Singapore regularly holds meetings with business groups, briefings by such senior ministers are not routine. The government [being] proactive, especially after the money laundering episode and the current global political and economic uncertainty,” one person familiar with the briefings said. “Singapore’s global stock as a financial hub is rising and the risks of being misunderstood and bad actors operating here have become greater.”\n\nThe prime minister’s office said public officials have been engaging with various groups, including banks and finance institutions, for decades. “We engage on a variety of issues — not only on international developments but also economic and social issues . . . Participants appreciate the opportunity to engage with ministers and public officials,” Lee’s office said.\n\nA US bank executive said the meetings had been well received by local employees, though senior leadership were surprised that the prime minister’s office was contacting the business on geopolitical matters. The inclusion of ministers such as Teo, a former two-star rear-admiral who has been serving as co-ordinating minister for national security since 2015, “raised eyebrows”, they said.\n\n“The ministers attending are among the top in Singapore, it is not something you say no to but it was surprising,” the person said. “The overall message we got was they want to make clearer that Singapore is still the safest, most reliable financial hub in the region.”\n\nStandard Chartered and Citigroup declined to comment.\n\nThis story has been amended to correct the name of the Singapore home affairs minister K Shanmugam",

    "body": "Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will step down next month after nearly 20 years in power, handing over to his deputy in what will be only the third leadership transition in the Asian financial hub’s modern history.\n\nLawrence Wong, deputy prime minister and finance minister, will become Singapore’s leader on May 15 after being named heir apparent in 2022 as part of the ruling People’s Action party’s long-standing succession plan.\n\nThe departure of Lee, the son of Singapore’s founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, raises expectations for a consequential general election that could be held as soon as this year.\n\nThe PAP, which has governed Singapore since independence, earned one of the lowest vote shares in the 2020 election in the city-state’s history. The party has been seeking to recover public support and bolster Singapore’s status as a trade and financial hub amid an increasingly febrile geopolitical backdrop.\n\nIn a post on social media platform X, Lee, who has served as prime minister since 2004, asked Singaporeans “to give Lawrence and his team your full support, and work with them to create a brighter future for Singapore”.\n\nWong said in a video statement he never expected to be asked to be the prime minister when he entered politics in 2011. “I accept this responsibility with humility and a deep sense of duty,” he said.\n\nThe succession marks an important moment in Singapore’s modern history, as just the third time the leadership baton has been passed since independence in 1965.\n\nWhile planning to ensure a smooth succession had been under way for years, the process has also faced a number of setbacks.\n\nLee, 72, had intended to step down before turning 70, plans that were derailed by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe PAP’s succession strategy was thrown into disarray in 2021 after deputy prime minister Heng Swee Keat resigned as leader of the so-called fourth-generation team, a group of younger ministers lined up to take the reins of the governing party.\n\nWong, 51, was announced as 4G leader in April 2022, and will become only the second Singaporean premier who is not a member of the Lee family.\n\nHe will face a difficult task in maintaining Singapore’s delicate geopolitical balancing act. A trading entrepot, Singapore has evolved into one of Asia’s main financial hubs while maintaining its neutrality between east and west. But its open economy makes it vulnerable to macroeconomic issues and US-China rivalry.\n\nWong warned last year that aspects of the Washington-Beijing rift appeared “insurmountable” and that tensions over the Taiwan Strait were becoming the region’s “most dangerous flashpoint”.\n\nHe also faces a challenging domestic environment, with rising discontent over inequality and rising costs of living, in particular housing.\n\nLinda Lim, a Singaporean and professor emerita of business at the University of Michigan who knew Wong when he studied economics there, said he would take over at a time when Singapore faces many new internal and external challenges, including to its economic model.\n\n“This is the opportunity for [Wong] and the rest of his leadership team to show that they can meet these challenges with fresh ideas and a more participatory democracy and inclusive economy than has hitherto characterised the nation’s political system.”\n\nManu Bhaskaran, an economist and chief executive of consultancy Centennial Asia Advisors, said another question following the “well choreographed” succession was whether there would be an early general election. Singapore is due to hold elections by November 2025, but is widely expected to do so as soon as September this year.\n\n“There is a lot of talk that the elections will be held well before the deadline. I would think Wong would want his own mandate to lead,” Bhaskaran said.\n\nIn the longer term, Wong will have to contend with a range of geopolitical challenges as well as maintain Singapore’s competitiveness given the rise of rivals such as Dubai and a high-cost structure, Bhaskaran added.\n\n“We have done well over the past few decades but how do you maintain that? That is his big challenge.”",

    "body": "Singapore, despite its modest size and population, is home to more businesses in this year’s ranking of high-growth companies in the Asia-Pacific region than any rival city.\n\nThis is not unusual for the city-state of just 6mn people. A trading entrepôt between east and west, the island nation has long been a leading destination for entrepreneurs and investors thanks to its strategic location within south-east Asia, supportive government policies, strong legal frameworks, and a mix of both local and foreign workers.\n\nMore recently, this appeal as a base for business has been boosted by Singapore’s neutral status between the US and China, which appeals to companies wishing to protect themselves from geopolitical and supply chain disruptions.\n\nWith 93 businesses in the FT’s ranking of high-growth companies in Asia-Pacific, Singapore beat the cities of Seoul and Tokyo — though South Korea and Japan outstripped the nation state on a countrywide basis.\n\nSingapore’s growth companies are varied, too — from such sectors as manufacturing, artificial intelligence, software, commodities and healthcare — underscoring the breadth of businesses that the city can support.\n\n“Singapore is neutral, it is the Switzerland of Asia,” says Dylan Ng, co-founder of Lionsbot, a manufacturer of cleaning robots that is 23rd in the ranking, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 178 per cent for the period between 2019 and 2022. “This is important with the geopolitical situation globally. There is a big pool of talent, you can deliver to the world and the city has a strong law-abiding reputation,” he adds.\n\nThe majority of Lionsbot’s customers are outside Singapore and the company is now focusing on growing in overseas markets, including the US and Europe, after raising $35mn in a series A funding round last year.\n\nBut even companies that do not do business in the city-state describe the benefits of having it as a base.\n\niCare, number 65 on the list this year with a CAGR of 115 per cent, provides access to basic but life-changing appliances — including washing machines, refrigerators and rice cookers — to low-income female factory workers in developing countries, including Laos and Cambodia.\n\nCo-founder Pablo Alonso Caprile, who is based in Cambodia, says having the group’s base in Singapore gives a “layer of safety”.\n\n“The benefits are multilateral. It simplifies paperwork and reporting, while high reporting and accounting standards allow investors comfort,” he says. iCare has its headquarters in the city state but does not have operations or core employees based there.\n\nSingapore is also a fundraising hub for the region and Caprile says he visits frequently because many of iCare’s investors have a presence in the city-state.\n\nThe company has a catalogue of appliances and works with factories to allow workers to buy the items they need and pay back in interest-free instalments.\n\niCare makes its margins from dealers, rather than charging customers and handles the repayments directly with the factories.\n\n“We have been running this successfully since 2015, well before ‘buy now, pay later’ was a household name,” Caprile points out.\n\nSkrya, another Singapore-based company at number 10 in the ranking, also gets most of its revenue from outside the city-state. Skrya helps clients, such as automobile parts companies, to recycle materials including palladium, rhodium and platinum via an app, Catalopedia, which uses AI and 3D to determine the best pricing.\n\n“We are trying to do an old type of business — recycling — in a modern way, with apps and tech,” explains Sivakumar Avadiar, chief executive officer for the five-year-old group.\n\nSkrya, which is profitable, has a number of facilities and a team of roughly 10 employees in Singapore. But it is planning to grow internationally this year, opening a new plant in India, which could add another $30mn-$40mn in revenue, Avadiar says.\n\nSingapore’s stable reputation, and the ease of setting up a company there, made it the best choice as a base, he adds. However, he has found the cost of running a business in the city has gone up in recent years.\n\nA survey of business sentiment by the Singapore Business Federation in January found that the increase in business costs is the top challenge companies are navigating, especially the cost of manpower.\n\nEven for tech start-ups, such as X0PA AI — a software company that uses artificial intelligence and automation to help clients hire employees better and faster — the environment has been tougher.\n\n“The market had a massive correction in the past few years,” says founder Nina Suri. “We had to correct ourselves and take a step back to focus on more sustainable growth.”\n\nX0PA AI is fundraising now, via a second series A round. Suri says the company expects to break even this quarter and hopes to turn a profit by the end of 2024.\n\nSingapore is X0PA AI’s largest market but the company is now focusing on growing in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as the US.\n\nSuri divides her time between Singapore and London but says Singapore’s ecosystem, which includes resources, talent and government support, such as grants, made it a “no brainer” to be X0PA AI’s base.\n\n“But, for a business like ours you can’t survive and grow enough in just Singapore,” she says. “The government understands that and we got a grant to expand into overseas markets including the United Arab Emirates and the UK.”\n\nHowever, despite the number of Singapore companies on this year’s list looking to expand beyond the city-state, there are still plenty that see opportunities in its small domestic market.\n\nDoctor Anywhere, which started life as a primary care tele-health start-up, is now growing rapidly offline. For example, it recently started operating a health screening and imaging diagnostics facility. The business is ranked 55th on this year’s list with a CAGR of 124 per cent.\n\n“Our underlying business comes from the region but many people come here for top healthcare,” says Wai Mun Lim, co-founder.\n\n“We are building out our business in the city before replicating many of our services in other countries we operate in the region, including Malaysia and the Philippines. When you tell anyone a business is from Singapore, it means you are legitimate.”",

    "body": "The writer is an FT contributing editor\n\nSingapore is a poster child for fiscal prudence. It almost always runs a budget surplus, and its constitution virtually prohibits borrowing to pay for current spending. All three major credit rating agencies assign it triple-A ratings, and the IMF judges its sovereign debt risks to be low.\n\nBut the country also has a whopping ratio of debt to gross domestic product — around 170 per cent. By the end of the year it will be the third most indebted nation on the planet. Are there lessons to take from the country’s approach to debt? If so, they come from understanding how it has arisen.\n\nFirst, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has intervened frequently to prevent the Singaporean dollar from appreciating relative to the basket of currencies against which it is managed, selling Singaporean dollars for foreign currency. As with Switzerland, the result has been burgeoning foreign exchange reserves, far more than the government’s estimate of what they need to maintain their peg. The government’s solution to this reserve glut has been to issue close to 40 per cent of GDP in non-marketable debt to the central bank.\n\nSecond, the social security system is configured in a manner bound to drive up government liabilities. Residents and their employers are compelled to contribute a significant portion of their salaries to the Central Provident Fund, from which they can draw money to pay for healthcare, housing and retirement. All CPF receipts are passed back to the government in return for non-tradable government debt certificates, which amount to over 90 per cent of GDP.\n\nThird, the government understands the importance of maintaining a liquid bond market. In the west we’ve come to regard bond markets simply as the only venues large enough to satisfy government borrowing needs rather than public goods in themselves. But absent deep debt capital markets, companies have little option but to channel all their financing needs through the banking system. In the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Singapore acted to ensure that companies could raise funds in capital markets rather than tie their collective fortunes to a small group of financial institutions. Bonds and bills sold into the market add close to 40 per cent to the debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nGiven a constitutional prohibition on using borrowing to fund day-to-day spending, receipts from debt sales are passed over to be managed by GIC, the government’s wholly-owned fund manager, and invested in global stocks, bonds, infrastructure and private equity. The result is that Singapore’s balance sheet looks more like a hedge fund than a sovereign. And despite significant short-term volatility, this has worked well for them over the medium-term. YeeFarn Phua, a director of sovereign ratings at S&P Global, estimates that the government has amassed a liquid portfolio worth more than $1tn — twice the level of GDP.\n\nA final source of indebtedness comes from debt-financing strategic local infrastructure. Despite nosebleed-level gross government debt metrics, parliament authorised in 2021 the issuance of S$90bn of bonds — around 20 per cent of GDP at the time — to finance projects like tidal walls and subway systems.\n\nDebt-fuelled asset purchases and investment by the public sector don’t always end well. In the UK, Woking council’s leveraged acquisition of a concentrated portfolio of commercial properties didn’t save it from issuing a section 114 bankruptcy notice last year. Arguably, it hastened it. And in 2009, state-backed conglomerate Dubai World needed bailing-out and restructuring after running into problems. But these look more like incompetence than bad luck.\n\nThe Singaporean state has been rewarded for absorbing market risk in the form of a dividend — worth over three percentage point of GDP — which is often large enough to flip increasingly persistent primary budget deficits into overall budget surpluses.\n\nFiscal rules can be a useful check on explosive debt dynamics. Six of the seven sets of fiscal rules deployed by UK governments since 2010, for instance, have referenced debt stock. But such a check would have barred the kind of investment that has enriched and developed Singapore. The experience of the city state shows that higher debt issuance is a poor measure of fiscal space. Concerns that markets may revolt if tapped for investment capital have not been borne out.\n\nIn any economy starved of investment, government has a role to play without fear of bond market vigilantism.",

    "blurb": "Political repression in the Chinese city and new regional fairs are shifting the balance of power",
    "date": "2024-03-2300:00:00.0",
    "body": "In January, walking around Singaporean fairs Art SG and SEA Focus, the attentive visitor could distinctly detect that special inflection of Cantonese typical to Hong Kong collectors. It is a sound that has become more common at art fairs in Singapore and elsewhere in Asia in the past few years as enticing alternatives to Hong Kong have emerged.\n\nSouth-east Asian artists and galleries have historically looked at Hong Kong as the go-to place to expand their worldwide reach, thanks to fairs such as Art Basel Hong Kong and the presence of international auction houses. Add to this its free flow of capital, tax-free port status, logistical efficiency and deep pool of talent, and it’s easy to see why regional players have kept returning to the city.\n\n“When contemporary Asian art began to flourish, Hong Kong naturally became the hub for collectors and dealers from south-east Asia,” says Singaporean collector Teng Jee Hum. He remembers collectors in south-east Asia using Hong Kong to settle purchases of Chinese ink masters from the mainland from the 1950s to the 1990s. “From 2000 onwards, it was the reverse flow,” says Teng, of mainland Chinese collectors buying works from south-east Asia — but still through Hong Kong.\n\nSouth-east Asia’s engagement with the city is visible at this year’s Art Basel Hong Kong. In the Encounters section for large-scale projects, Filipino artist Patricia Perez Eustaquio will show embroidery and textile work and Singaporean Ming Wong a video installation. South-east Asian galleries at the fair include Gajah Gallery, Richard Koh Fine Art and ROH Projects.\n\nBut the past five years have been a more mixed story for Hong Kong. The important M+ museum was completed and international auction houses have moved or are planning to move their regional headquarters to bigger spaces in the city. At the same time, Hong Kong’s position has been challenged by a surge of authoritarianism from the mainland, a reduction of democratic freedoms and harsh pandemic restrictions, resulting in an outflow of people. “All these developments had a diluting effect on the vibrancy of Hong Kong and we are witnessing some Hong Kong players increasing their Singapore presence,” Teng says.\n\nThese emigrants have been replaced by mainland Chinese people flocking to Hong Kong under new schemes aimed at attracting talent and wealth. “This is creating a new dynamic in the city,” says Hong Kong collector Alan Lo, who predicts more mainland collectors and patrons will participate in the city’s institutional landscape over time. “I see Hong Kong becoming the Monaco of China where people come to spend money, buy luxury homes and yachts, drink expensive wine, build art collections.”\n\nMeanwhile, other regional cities have grown in economic prosperity and bolstered their art market. Teng notes that east and south-east Asia are benefiting from evolving global supply chains, not least thanks to the US-China rivalry. “Art goes where the money is,” he says, pointing out that the Hong Kong stock and property markets are currently languishing, whereas Japan’s and South Korea’s are at or near record highs. “The latter are also actively promoting art and culture overseas as soft power.”\n\n“During the pandemic and right after, there were many speculations as to whether Hong Kong could maintain its role as the art hub of Asia,” says Lo. “We have seen attempts by art-fair owners to expand into Singapore, Seoul, Taipei, Tokyo, which makes Asia a much stronger and deeper overall landscape.” In 2023, the fairs Tokyo Gendai and Art SG had their debuts, attracting the international community, while the second edition of Frieze Seoul and the 22nd edition of Kiaf Seoul were held simultaneously.\n\n“Singapore is building itself nicely as a hub for south-east Asian art,” says Lo. He appreciates the state for its diversity and distinct character, which combines Malay, Indian, Chinese and western cultures. “In a way I feel Singapore responds best to our interest in Asian diaspora.”\n\nRachel Lehmann of Lehmann Maupin gallery, which has a space in Seoul, says the Korean gallery scene is highly developed, due to widespread public interest in contemporary art: “Collectors in South Korea and Taiwan come from a long, intergenerational lineage of collecting.”\n\nEven so, Hong Kong’s rivals are still significantly smaller than it: Singapore and South Korea do not feature in the Art Basel and UBS Art Market Report’s eight largest markets.\n\nIf, for galleries, it’s about choosing the fairs or spaces which offer the best financial results, for collectors it is also about the perks of the fair ecosystem. For example, when travelling to fairs, Alan Lo never misses the chance to visit private foundations and homes to hear the story of their collections. “Taipei is probably the best for it because of the deeply rooted collector community,” he says. “It also has such an amazing food culture. I’m not going to lie: that plays a big role!”\n\nWhat galleries and collectors agree on is that while Asia as a whole is vast and diverse enough to support multiple art capitals, the market in Hong Kong remains vibrant and unparalleled in the region. “The parlour game of guessing which city will replace Hong Kong’s hub status has been going on for years,” says Gagosian Hong Kong director Nick Simunovic, “but there is no replacing this city’s role in Asia’s art ecology. The next Hong Kong is Hong Kong.”",

    "body": "Malaysia is reviving a plan to build the country’s first high-speed railway connecting its capital of Kuala Lumpur to neighbouring Singapore after the two governments failed to reach an agreement on an earlier version of the project.\n\nThe first seven proposals submitted recently by the private sector include bids from consortiums led by state-owned China Railway Construction; South Korea’s Hyundai Rotem, a Hyundai Motor unit focused on railways and defence; and local conglomerates such as MMC, Gamuda, YTL, WCT Holdings and Berjaya, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMyHSR, the government-owned entity leading the project, declined to name the companies interested in the project. Japanese companies did not submit proposals during the expression-of-interest process that ended on January 15.\n\nMyHSR will shortlist three to four consortiums for the next phase, the request for proposals round, as early as this month and present its review of the bids to the cabinet, sources said. The Malaysian government is expected to present the proposal to Singapore over the next few months to determine if the city-state wants to take part in the project.\n\n“We want to finalise [the proposal] as quickly as possible, hopefully over the next three to four months,” a Malaysian official told Nikkei Asia. MyHSR is also discussing an option to extend the line from Kuala Lumpur only to the southern state of Johor if Singapore decides not to participate.\n\nThe expression-of-interest phase of the bidding follows Malaysia’s call in July last year for the private sector to submit proposals to develop and operate the project through a public-private partnership model.\n\nIn August, Singapore said it was willing to discuss any new proposal from Malaysia “starting from a clean state”, then-acting transport minister Chee Hong Tat told parliament. The city-state said at the time that it had not received any new proposals from its neighbour.\n\nThe revived plan comes as momentum grows for Malaysia to enhance its transport system and help make Johor a regional investment destination. The government signed a memorandum of understanding with Singapore in January to jointly develop a special economic zone in the southern state as a new engine of growth.\n\nSultan Ibrahim of Johor, who became Malaysia’s new king in January, said he wanted to revive the project. “I will make it [come back] on,” he told Singapore’s Straits Times in an interview published in December.\n\nBut Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has said the government will not fund the project and is instead seeking privately backed proposals. Due to the country’s financial constraints, the government favours proposals with “comprehensive financing”, an official told Nikkei Asia.\n\nDuring the initial review of the private-sector proposals, the Chinese consortium consisting of China Railway Construction, China Communications Construction and the Export-Import Bank of China, was seen as a strong candidate for the shortlist, given its financing scheme, sources said.\n\nThe high-speed railway project with Singapore was first floated in 2013 during former prime minister Najib Razak’s administration. The 350km link, which was agreed in 2016 and due to open in 2026, would have cut travel time between the two cities to about 90 minutes, versus more than four hours by car.\n\nThe high-speed rail line had been expected to boost cross-border business as well as development of areas along the line. The two neighbours have close economic ties, with the air route linking Singapore and Kuala Lumpur among the busiest in the world.\n\nAt the time, the project was estimated to cost about $17bn, and companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Europe had expressed interest in contracts to build, operate and finance the trains and rail assets.\n\nBut the project was hit by multiple delays due to escalating costs and changes in plans. The project was eventually scrapped in 2021, after Malaysia and Singapore failed to reach an agreement. Malaysia paid more than S$100mn (US$74mn) in compensation to Singapore for the termination.\n\nThe latest iteration of the project comes against a backdrop of new high speed rail lines in south-east Asia. In October, Indonesia officially opened the region’s first high-speed railway, connecting 140km between Jakarta and Bandung in less than an hour. The $7bn line was built by a consortium of Indonesian and Chinese state-owned companies, with government support for land acquisition.\n\nBut analysts said significant hurdles would need to be overcome if Malaysia were to complete the project. At an estimated cost of up to RM120bn ($25bn), funding is another obstacle for the government, which seeks to pay for the rail line with capital exclusively from private companies.\n\nAdib Zalkapli, director at advisory BowerGroupAsia, said the project was “very ambitious” and would be “costly” for Malaysia to complete without clear government support, although the country’s tight fiscal position poses serious constraints.\n\nTo shore up the country’s fiscal position, Malaysia in October passed legislation to limit the country’s debt to 60 per cent of gross domestic product within three to five years. The country’s public debt as of December had reached RM1.5tn, or more than 80 per cent of GDP, well above this target.\n\nAdditional reporting by Dylan Loh\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on March 6. ©2024 Nikkei Inc.

    "body": "Shimano, the world’s largest bicycle parts maker, will use its new plant in Singapore as a hub for exploring south-east Asia’s high-potential market for sports bikes, the company’s chair and chief executive Yozo Shimano said.\n\n“Our Singapore plant is controlling our major overseas factories,” he told Nikkei Asia in an exclusive interview, adding that as demand for bicycles increased in Asia and Latin America, its Singapore plant, which mainly makes midrange components, would become even more important.\n\nThe plant went online in 2023, replacing an old one established in 1973. Investing ¥25bn ($165mn), Shimano renewed the facilities to increase efficiency.\n\nThe company was founded in 1921 by ironworker Shozaburo Shimano in the industrial city of Sakai, just south of Osaka.\n\nIt develops and manufactures a wide range of parts, such as gears, transmissions, brakes and wheels, mainly for sports bikes including road and mountain bikes, with an estimated global share of 85 per cent.\n\nShimano has factories in Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, China and the Czech Republic. In co-ordination with the factories in neighbouring counties, the Singapore plant focuses on midrange products, which account for 70 per cent of the company’s production volume.\n\nThe chair, who served as the company’s fifth president until 2021, said the Singapore plant had been playing a key decision-making role in the company’s global operations. It identifies overseas facilities that need investment and passes on suggestions to the head office in Japan, he said. The company will continue to invest about ¥40bn annually in facilities and equipment for medium- to long-term growth, 60 per cent of which will be spent overseas, including in Singapore.\n\nEurope and North America are the largest markets for sports bikes, but Shimano is betting on growth in south-east Asia, where most people once viewed sports bikes as luxuries.\n\n“In countries like Vietnam, bicycles are first and foremost a means of transportation, but as the economy develops, demand for sports bikes will also increase,” he said. He expects roughly 20 per cent of the company’s products will serve end users in south-east Asia in the medium to long term.\n\nThe company is accelerating its efforts to promote sports bikes in south-east Asia by holding bicycle competitions in co-operation with bicycle makers and local agencies. It has been operating a museum, Shimano Cycling World, in Singapore since 2014 to foster cycling culture.\n\nBut Shimano’s road ahead seems more bumpy than smooth, and taking it requires being well-equipped.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Shimano’s performance was buoyed by a surge in demand for outdoor gear. Net sales and income reached record highs of ¥628.9bn and ¥128.1bn in 2022, a great leap from the ¥363.2bn and ¥51.8bn in 2019.\n\n“We had anticipated that there would eventually be a slump,” said the chair. In 2023, net sales and income fell to ¥474.3bn and ¥61.1bn as demand declined after the pandemic. The company is now seeking ways to revive its performance.\n\n“At the time when demand was surging, we had to prioritise increasing production and postpone other projects for medium- and long-term growth that we had begun,” he said. Now the company has resumed one of those projects: increasing in-house manufacturing to shorten delivery times.\n\nAccording to Shimano, the company currently outsources about 50 per cent of its parts for the company’s flagship parts series, Dura-Ace, to subcontractors. “We make products by combining other companies’ excellent technologies and expertise. We cannot make all of them by ourselves,” he said. “[But] the supply chain for bicycles is long, and manufacturing takes time . . . We will be able to shorten the lead time by bringing what we can do in-house to some extent.”\n\nThe company plans to increase its in-house production ratio to approximately 70 per cent for Dura-Ace in the next few years and improve production efficiency by utilising digital and other technologies, with an annual investment of ¥15bn. “We should be able to improve profit margins,” he added.\n\nThe competition in the market has increased as e-bikes — sports bikes powered by lightweight batteries — become popular and new manufacturers enter the market. “We will be able to take advantage of our many years of experience as a bicycle parts manufacturer and our knowledge of bicycles,” Shimano said.\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on March 6. ©2024 Nikkei Inc.

    "body": "Banks in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations may be seeing the last of beefy earnings from loans in the current higher financing era as lower interest rates loom.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve has signalled rate cuts in the coming months on lower inflation worries, gradually making money cheaper to borrow. For the Asean’s biggest banks, most of which are based in Singapore, growth in income from loans could slow over the coming months.\n\n“It is inevitable that this environment will change,” said Kavan Choksi, wealth consultant at corporate advisory KC Consulting. “It is imperative for banks to redirect their focus towards devising strategies to sustain growth amid evolving interest rate environments.”\n\nThe three major Singaporean financial institutions — DBS, United Overseas Bank and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation — refer to Fed rates when setting those for their own loans. Expectations are that growth in interest profits may have peaked.\n\nOCBC on Wednesday said net interest margins — the difference between what a bank earns from loans and what it has to pay depositors, relative to interest-earning assets — should range from 2.2 per cent to 2.25 per cent in 2024, lower than the 2.29 per cent logged in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nThe bank booked a net profit of S$1.6bn (US$1.2bn) for the October-December quarter, up 12 per cent from the same period in 2022, even as the lender expects “low single-digit loan growth” in 2024.\n\n“We expect 2024 to be a more challenging year than 2023,” said OCBC chief Helen Wong during Wednesday’s earnings briefing. “Would there be upside? It depends also on how interest rate environment will actually exhibit in the rest of the year.”\n\nOCBC peer UOB noted in its latest earnings release that interest margins had peaked. Last week, the lender said net interest margins stood at 2.02 per cent in October-December — the lowest of all the quarters in 2023. The margin last year hit 2.14 per cent in January-March, with results steadily declining over consecutive quarters.\n\n“It’s very clear on a declining interest rate environment . . . the ability to manage costs of deposits will be more important than the ability to manage yield,” said Lee Wai Fai, UOB’s chief financial officer, during an earnings briefing last week. “The challenge we have is to sustain the NIM . . . we have to manage aggressively our deposit base.”\n\nTo stay competitive, Singapore’s banks have raised interest payouts to depositors in the current era of higher financing costs. But the same costs would have deterred some customers from increasing or obtaining new leverage, putting lenders in a position where profitability from loans compresses.\n\nCarmen Lee, an analyst at OCBC’s investment research unit, wrote in a report this month that slower growth in loans and unexpected deceleration in macroenvironment conditions in UOB’s key Asean markets were risks for the bank.\n\n“Net interest margins improved from 1.86 per cent in financial year ‘22 to 2.09 per cent in financial year ‘23,” she wrote of the previous uptick, while noting the less positive prospects ahead. “[UOB] management is guiding for NIM of around 2 per cent in financial year ‘24.”\n\nElsewhere in Asean, Thai and Indonesian lenders also grapple with pressure on earnings. Credit research agency CreditSights noted in a January report on Thailand’s lenders, including Krung Thai Bank, TMB Thanachart Bank and Bangkok Bank, that “quarterly NIMs near or has peaked”.\n\n“Loan growth saw yet another weak quarter [from October to December] due to a common focus on quality given elevated household debt and challenged small and medium enterprises, amid a still sluggish and uneven economic recovery,” the report said. “The banks remain cautious for financial year ‘24.”\n\nIn Indonesia, CreditSights noted in February that lenders Bank Mandiri and Bank Negara Indonesia “delivered a strong performance” last year, though both faced more NIM pressure.\n\n“Funding costs rose again in quarter four so both banks saw quarter-on-quarter NIM compression,” the report said. “Both banks have guided for overall flat to slightly lower financial year ‘24 NIMs.”\n\nDBS, south-east Asia’s largest bank by total assets, this month reported that NIM in October-December stood at 2.13 per cent, just a whisker above the 2.12 per cent recorded in January-March and the second-lowest figure last year. Peak performance in 2023 was logged in July-September when NIM was booked at 2.19 per cent.\n\n“We took a conscious decision to put on some fixed-rate assets in the tail end of the third quarter and fourth quarter,” said DBS chief Piyush Gupta during an earnings call this month. “We put on about S$30bn in that period of time just to lock in rates to protect us from a declining interest rate environment.”\n\nA report from the equity research unit of Jefferies this month noted a deteriorating global macroeconomic outlook as a risk to DBS, which could limit any upside to capital returns for the bank, after the lender published its earnings results.\n\n“[The] company does not see stress in the book right now,” the report noted. “We see rather limited upside . . . with costs running slightly higher and . . . NIM marginally softer.”\n\nBut there may still be some time left for banks such as DBS to make the most out of high financing costs, with the Fed signalling a cautious approach to any rate cuts in the future.\n\nIn a report this month, the global research unit of HSBC highlighted that for the US central bank, the “timing of any move to cut policy rates may still depend significantly on inflation readings to come in the months ahead”.\n\n“We have growing confidence,” noted HSBC, quoting Fed chair Jay Powell’s remarks at a January meeting. “But not to the point where we feel like it’s a highly consequential decision to start the process of dialling back on restriction.”\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on February 27. ©2024 Nikkei Inc.

    "body": "Singapore’s prime minister has defended a deal to secure pop star Taylor Swift’s only performances in south-east Asia this year, dismissing rising indignation from the city-state’s neighbours.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong confirmed on Tuesday that Singapore had negotiated for the city-state to be the singer’s only stop in the region of 700mn but denied that such an arrangement was “unfriendly” to the city-state’s neighbours.\n\n“It has turned out to be a very successful arrangement. I don’t see that as being unfriendly,” Lee said on Tuesday in Australia, where he was attending a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\n“If we had not made such an arrangement, would she have come to someplace else in south-east Asia or more places in south-east Asia? Maybe, maybe not,” he added, without revealing the terms of the deal.\n\nSwift’s blockbuster Eras tour has provided an economic boost to destinations around the world, with her fans driving a surge in spending.\n\nMore than 300,000 tickets have been sold to her six sold-out concerts in Singapore, which conclude this week. Many of the attendees are from overseas. Hotel and airfare prices have soared by double digits in the city-state as far back as a year ago.\n\nBut the announcement of the tour’s Asia-Pacific dates last year stoked widespread disappointment across south-east Asia, after Swift revealed that she would only be stopping in Singapore, Japan and Australia.\n\nThailand’s prime minister alleged last month that Singapore had offered the singer subsidies of up to $3mn a show on the condition that she not perform elsewhere in the region. Srettha Thavisin said he had been told of the deal by promoter Anschutz Entertainment Group.\n\nSingapore’s culture ministry and tourism board said in a joint statement last month that they had worked directly with AEG to book Swift.\n\nSingapore’s culture minister Edwin Tong told the city-state’s parliament on Monday that speculation about the size of the grant to Swift was “not accurate and not anywhere as high as speculated”.\n\n“Due to business confidentiality, we cannot reveal the specific size and conditions of the grant,” he added.\n\nSwift’s representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPrime Minister Lee said such deals helped expand the economy and bring in “goodwill and visitors” from the region.\n\nIn the Philippines, lawmaker Joey Salceda said in a statement last week that an exclusivity deal was “not what good neighbours do” and “runs contrary to the principle of consensus-based relations and solidarity on which the Asean was founded”. Salceda added that he had asked the Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs to formally protest against the arrangement.\n\nHong Kong also expressed displeasure at being overlooked in favour of its rival financial hub, with the Chinese territory’s government saying that most entertainment events “operate on commercial principles without government involvement”.\n\nSwift’s performances were “a boost to Singapore’s status”, said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, an analyst for Aletheia Capital. “Investors in Singapore’s hotel and tourism sectors will welcome it.”\n\nHe added that Singapore was a “no-brainer” for performers thanks to “superior logistics and connectivity” but said “Asean benefits as a whole” from the tour.\n\nTong, Singapore’s culture minister, warned on Monday that the government could take action against individuals found to have breached the confidentiality clause in Swift’s contract.\n\nThe government will assess the terms of the contract and will take “appropriate measures under advisement”, he said.",

    "body": "Neil Shen, China’s most prominent tech investor, acquired permanent residency in Singapore and later opened an office for his $56bn venture capital firm in the city-state as tensions rose between Washington and Beijing.\n\nThe billionaire founder of Sequoia China, renowned for early investments in Alibaba, ByteDance and Shein, was granted the status before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nOne of the people close to Shen cited “personal reasons” for the decision, while another said the first application was made over a decade ago.\n\nShen’s firm, which rebranded last year as HongShan, subsequently expanded into Singapore, opening an office in the financial hub as it split from US-based Sequoia last June.\n\nHongShan has also encouraged some of its China-based portfolio companies with global ambitions to set up entities in Singapore since the pandemic.\n\n“The decision to open a Singapore office was made for business reasons and was not related to personal matters of any of our executives,” said HongShan in a statement. HongShan has previously said the Singapore office was set up to fulfil local legal requirements.\n\nAnother person familiar with Shen’s situation said he had been spending little time in Singapore and still appeared to be based in Hong Kong with frequent travel to mainland China.\n\nShen, 56, became an early mover in a trend that became replicated many times over by wealthy Chinese, especially those tied to the country’s tech sector. Many shifted to low-tax, stable Singapore amid strict pandemic lockdowns in the mainland as well as President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on tech companies and calls for wealth redistribution.\n\nThe city-state, which has a large ethnic Chinese population, strikes a neutral line between the US and China. Tensions between the two superpowers have grown since Donald Trump’s election as US president in 2016 and have continued under Joe Biden.\n\n“Neil’s decision . . . made it a lot easier for others to follow after that,” one of the people said, adding the move was “spoken about” in Chinese business circles even though it has not become publicly known until now.\n\nPermanent residency in the city-state allows those with the pass to apply for permanent residency for their spouses and children, pay lower taxes on property purchases and paves the way for Singapore citizenship.\n\nShen led Sequoia’s China business before political pressure stemming from worsening Sino-US relations forced it to split from its American arm. The divorce resulted in three separate businesses: HongShan in China, Peak XV in India and south-east Asia and Sequoia Capital in the US.\n\nHongShan has since sought to become more global, pursuing business opportunities and investments worldwide to benefit its Chinese portfolio companies.\n\nOne mainland start-up in the healthcare industry backed by HongShan told the Financial Times it had received advice to start a Singapore entity as that would ease its expansion into international markets including the US. Two other co-investors in start-ups also backed by HongShan said founders had been told to establish a Singapore presence.\n\nSome have already been set up. Beijing-based Moonshot AI, which last week raised $1bn, last year established a Singapore entity. HongShan is a longtime investor in the start-up.\n\nChina’s Hai Robotics, an autonomous warehouse robotics start-up and another HongShan-backed company, set up a Singapore office in late 2021.\n\nOther Chinese companies with large operations in western markets, including TikTok owner ByteDance and fast-fashion group Shein, have picked Singapore as their global headquarters. Both companies are backed by HongShan.\n\nHongShan declined to comment, but a person close to the company said many of its portfolio companies had offices around the world, including in Singapore.\n\nHongShan, Moonshot AI and ByteDance were named in a US congressional report this month which scrutinised American capital invested in Chinese tech companies that support Beijing’s military and its repression of minorities in Xinjiang.\n\nMeanwhile, other Chinese business figures, particularly in the investment and technology sectors, have sought residency in Singapore and expanded or opened offices in the city-state in recent years.\n\nSean Tong, the co-founder of China’s Boyu Capital, a leading private equity firm set up by a grandson of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin, relocated to Singapore from Hong Kong during the early stages of the pandemic. Boyu opened a Singapore office in 2019.\n\nZhang Lei, the billionaire China-born founder of Hillhouse Capital, became a Singaporean citizen. Hillhouse expanded and consolidated into larger premises in 2022.\n\nDianping founder Zhang Tao and Tencent co-founder Tony Zhang relocated to Singapore in the past few years.",

    "body": "When I visit a bar, I (of course) love an excellent cocktail — and meeting bartenders and mixologists who are super geeky about their latest brew. But if, as a guest, you don’t feel like you’ve stumbled into a bit of magic, and aren’t made to feel looked after, then you’re just enjoying a great drink — not a great bar. Having been fortunate enough to travel and witness first-hand the plethora of different bars, clubs and restaurants around the world — and having worked in, owned and run a wide range of venues for some 20 years — I’ve become quite particular about how I define a fantastic bar.\n\nBelow are some of my favourite places around the globe that aren’t solely focused on serving a quality product, but offer the total package, feel inclusive and reflect a passion — and even though they’re off the beaten track, they’re well worth making a special effort to visit.\n\nThis is a contender for my favourite bar in the world: understated, charming and an important piece of Madrid history. It became a popular hang-out for Republican soldiers and their supporters during the Spanish Civil War, and to this day there’s a homeliness, with no photography allowed (though modern clientele are probably less wary of potential spies knocking around). There are barrels of sherry on offer (try the Palo Cortado — a dry style that jumps between savoury, nutty and aromatic), simple yet superb snacks (I usually order the anchovies on bread and some bottarga) and even a resident cat padding around. Over an evening, the atmosphere evolves from rather sedate to raucous when guests spill on to the streets. Madrid is said to have more bars per capita than any other European city, so naturally there are great cocktail spots and vermuterías adjacent, should you wish to hop between a few places. I also like nearby Viva Madrid, but I wouldn’t be in a rush to leave La Venencia. It's the perfect place to settle in for a few hours. Website; Directions\n\nThere is no shortage of good bars in Melbourne, a city renowned for its craft cocktail culture, but a real favourite is Caretaker’s Cottage, located behind a church on Little Lonsdale Street in a tiny bluestone cottage (a former caretaker’s quarters). It strikes the perfect balance of cocktail bar, home from home and pub, and is owned and operated by some dear friends and ex-Lyan family, who offer the warmth of Aussie hospitality in the most wonderful way. Chat to the team, listen to great music and drink through the short but well-crafted menu. They’re known for having Guinness on tap and milk punch (a milk and brandy or bourbon-based cocktail that originated in the 18th century), and a cleverly curated wine list. Website; Directions\n\nJust a few blocks away from Caretaker’s Cottage, Section 8 is a cool outdoor bar that first started as a pop-up but did so well it became a permanent fixture. Locals call it the “Container Bar” because it’s in a converted shipping container that’s located in a car park in Chinatown. It’s a fun place to grab a drink while soaking up the Australian sun and taking in a bit of Melbourne’s music scene (it regularly hosts bands). Drinks are fittingly summery and nod to iconic songs: my favourite cocktail is the “Good Kid, M.A.A.D Litty” (a riff on the Kendrick Lamar album) made with tequila, hibiscus and lemongrass syrup, guava nectar and citrus. Website; Directions\n\nThis is the bar I wish was part of the Lyan family. An Edinburgh institution that still manages to feel like a local spot, with great Guinness, a lively atmosphere and warmth, and well-priced drams of single malt whisky. It’s a beautiful little stone building tucked away on a cobbled side street in the New Town, and the small space doesn’t take much to get packed out. Stepping through the door almost feels like you’re in a time warp, instantly looping you in to a real sense of community. This is the place to go for real ales, with rotating taps from Scottish craft breweries, and the friendly staff are more than happy to talk you through their selection. Website; Directions\n\nOwned and run by Jean Trinh, a friend, super-talented bartender and one of the nicest figures in the industry, Alquímico, which is based in a renovated colonial mansion, is a wonderful showcase of Colombia, one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. It’s no surprise that this bar has been named the best in all of South America for the past few years. Jean’s commitment to highlighting indigenous knowledge, ingredients and culture is channelled through three floors of dancing, food and cocktails, each with a different personality, offering something for any occasion. The menu is a celebration of Colombia’s brilliant produce with inventive applications. I recommend the taquitos with banana peel, the yucca dumplings and the ahuyama (squash) ceviche, while sipping on a Selva martini (replete with aromatic herb oil) or a Kianga, marrying local fruits, herbs and honey with one of my favourite Scottish single malts. Website; Directions\n\nIn a city renowned for its phenomenal culinary scene, it is no surprise that Copenhagen also offers many great cocktail bars to explore, though its natural wine and beer scene is what really excites me. From hole-in-the-wall venues to converted warehouse spaces and stylish modern bars, there’s something for every occasion. And although wine bars and a brewpub might seem like things you can find elsewhere, these three places — from the decor to the service to the atmosphere — feel distinctly Danish.\n\nVed Stranden 10 is one of the city’s most stylish natural wine bars. Set in a historic tea shop, the charming canal-side venue is not known for its menu but lack thereof, so it’s best to ask the knowledgable staff for a recommendation. Featured wines come from small, independent producers, so you’re likely to enjoy something you’ve never heard of, or learn something new. Website; Directions\n\nPompette, a natural wine bar and shop in the chic Nørrebro neighbourhood, has despite its popularity remained strong on its mission to sell top-quality products at reasonable prices. I recommend a glass of one of Tschida’s wines, a producer in Austria’s Burgenland, and a fried chicken sandwich from Poulette, the bar’s takeaway sandwich shop right next door. Website; Directions\n\nCraft beer lovers will be acquainted with Copenhagen’s Mikkekeller, and its Warpigs brewpub is a must-stop for me for a locally brewed something (you can cover all tastes here) before exploring the old Meatpacking District and its restaurants and art spaces. Website; Directions\n\nAs historic spaces go, this one, south Asia’s grand-dame hotel, is particularly fabulous, and despite my ancestral connection, I love it simply as it channels a bygone era. The hotel, which opened in 1864, is one of the oldest east of the Suez. I came here with family just to enjoy the glamorous setting, but ended up settling into cocktails using Rockland produce — a pioneering local family distillery that’s been operating for a century on the island. It’s an incomparable spot to sit back on a waterside terrace, order a daiquiri and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Website; Directions\n\nI love tea for its complexity, variety and versatility as much as I do whisky, so I love finding venues that are committed to it as much as great bars are to their booze. This lively restaurant dates back nearly a century, and has a magical touch balancing styling, product and service that makes you feel like you’ve wandered into a different era. Order everything (from the very cool, old-style menu cards) — the traditional dim sum are delicious — and lean into the great atmosphere. Website; Directions\n\nAn Australian export to a city replete with great bars, this taverna offers the magic of traditional stylings, local wines, beers and cocktails alongside the requisite tapas — but the energy and service are what makes this particular spot stick out. The local Txakoli wine — fresh, light and zesty with a slight minerality — alongside the richness of cured tuna and ham or a steak tartare is a match made in heaven. But with an impressive list of local wines (many by the glass), along with some other old world gems, the trick here is to go with enough friends to tackle the whole menu. Website; Directions\n\nNew York has some of the best drinking spots in the world and, given that cocktails are an American invention, the city has you covered for everything from pitch-perfect classics to seasonal specialities and cutting-edge serves. But this Brooklyn joint brings the joy of a dive bar, with live music, sparkling wine on tap and very cold beer. This is an unpretentious spot in Bushwick, and there other great places about (Empirical’s new distillery is nearby), but first have a boilermaker (beer with a shot of bourbon on the side) — and see where the night takes you. Website; Directions\n\nSingapore is a wonderful melting pot of cultures and uniquely positioned at the centre of so many international influences, but before this cocktail bar opened, many bars (and restaurants) — even at the finer end of the spectrum — focused on Western ideals and ingredients. Co-owner Vijay Mudaliar (again, a friend, ex-Lyan family and one of the loveliest folks in the industry) wanted to celebrate his homeland in a more authentic manner, embracing local ingredients, music, materials and accents. What results is a wonderful love letter to Singaporean culture, with flavours and compositions you won’t find anywhere else.

    "blurb": "Lack of new listings and stalled mergers dim prospects for ‘blank-cheque companies’",
    "date": "2024-02-2000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Two years after Asia’s two big financial hubs, Singapore and Hong Kong, allowed so-called blank-cheque companies as a novel way to help fast-growing technology start-ups and others go public, the results have fallen short of expectations.\n\nThese fundraising vehicles, known as special-purpose acquisition companies (Spacs), raise money with a promise to invest in an operating company. They have largely failed to deliver an era of quicker listings of tech upstarts on Asian exchanges.\n\nMost Spacs listed in the two financial centres have failed to bring privately held companies on to their stock exchanges. Nor have any new Spacs made their debuts in Singapore or Hong Kong last year, after a flurry of initial public offerings of these fundraising shell companies in 2022.\n\n“Investor interest in Asian Spacs has been poor,” said Mak Yuen Teen, a professor of accounting at the National University of Singapore Business School. “The experiment with Spacs is over in Singapore, and probably Hong Kong, even if the exchanges do not want to admit it and claim that there may be other Spac listings in future.”\n\nSingapore may have beaten Hong Kong to listing the first Spacs in January 2022, but Mak called that victory “hollow”. Three Spacs — Vertex Technology Acquisition, Novo Tellus Alpha Acquisition and Pegasus Asia — launched IPOs on the Singapore Exchange that month.\n\nTwo years later, only Vertex, backed by Singapore state investor Temasek, completed a merger. The other two failed to do so, setting both on a path to dissolution, with the money raised via their IPOs returning to investors.\n\nVertex merged with 17Live in December, allowing the Taiwan-founded livestreaming platform to bypass a traditional IPO, which was the appeal, at least in theory, that Spacs presented to tech start-ups looking to go public.\n\nA traditional IPO involves a more arduous vetting process and typically requires more time. Spacs do the initial work of the IPO, with the start-up using it as a vehicle to become a publicly traded company via a merger, also known as a “de-Spac”.\n\nUS markets paved the way for the rise of Spacs in 2021 when the Covid-19 pandemic was in full swing and interest rates were low, which fed risk appetite among investors for fast-growing, but also cash-burning, tech start-ups.\n\nSingapore unicorns such as Grab and Sea Group, or start-ups with a value of over $1bn, listed in the US, with Sea doing so via a traditional IPO while Grab went public with a de-Spac.\n\nThe ambition was for Asian exchanges to take a slice of the lucrative Spac pie, and Singapore and Hong Kong formalised their rules for blank-cheque companies by 2022, opening the way for sponsors and their targets to make it work.\n\nBut this has not always produced the desired results. 17Live’s share price, for instance, has dived more than 70 per cent from the benchmark set by the shell company it merged with.\n\n“It is clear that the Singapore experiment with Spacs has failed,” Mak said. “While SGX may claim that there is now a Spac framework, and does not rule out future Spac listings, I think it is game over.”\n\nSGX, the city-state’s bourse, has not had a new Spac listing after the first three. Its rival, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has also seen a drought in such listings.\n\nAccording to financial markets data provider LSEG, the last Spac to list on the Hong Kong market was TechStar Acquisition in December 2022, bringing the total number of blank-cheque companies to five. With no new Spacs listed since then, only two — Aquila Acquisition and Vision Deal HK Acquisition — found target companies to merge with.\n\n“Since the launch of the Spac regime in Hong Kong in 2022, it has yet to spark significant waves,” said Hebe Chen, market analyst at IG International. “Escalating fears of a global recession and China’s lacklustre economic recovery have contributed to a growing cautious mood in the Hong Kong market, leading to a sharp decline in market valuations and restricted liquidity.”\n\nSoaring inflation, coupled with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, helped to make investors skittish. The US Federal Reserve set the tone by jacking up interest rates and central banks elsewhere have followed suit, ending the era of cheap money that helped fuel the rise of Spacs.\n\nThe performance of de-Spaced entities has also been lacklustre. Like Singapore-listed 17Live, Grab’s share price has sagged by more than 70% since its US listing. Grab listed on Nasdaq via its Spac merger in December 2021. It was only in November 2023 that it logged its first quarterly profit on an adjusted basis since its founding more than a decade ago.\n\n“Interest towards Spacs has been extremely speculative, and only investors with higher risk appetites were really willing to inject funds into the listed vehicles,” said Oriano Lizza, a sales trader at trading platform provider CMC Markets. “Specifically, with higher [interest] rate environments, investors were not required to take such risk, and opted for risk-free returns in the case of fixed deposits and government bonds.”\n\nPol de Win, SGX’s head of global sales and origination, said the bourse’s decisions on Spacs were not made based on one market cycle, but for the longer term, adding that a scenario where blank-cheque companies make a comeback in “the next five years” is possible.\n\nHe said that for a good de-Spac to occur, the IPO environment has to be “conducive,” and this has not largely been the case for the last two years. “If we go back two years, we would have hoped that we were in a different position now,” de Win said. “But a lot of that, or pretty much all of that, is just down to timing and market conditions.”\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on February 12. ©2024 Nikkei Inc.

    "blurb": "Sales of luxury cars, properties and golf memberships fall in wake of $2.2bn money laundering probe",
    "date": "2024-02-1200:00:00.0",
    "body": "A Singapore private club known for catering to wealthy Chinese clients has shut down as ultra-rich residents of the Asian financial hub increasingly opt for discretion over conspicuous displays of wealth.\n\nCircle 33, located inside a former colonial residence on Scotts Road in the swish suburb of Orchard, has closed its doors after failing to renew its lease last year, according to three people familiar with the wine club’s situation.\n\nThe closure of the club, which was launched in 2021, comes as sales of luxury goods such as watches, cars, high-end apartments and golf memberships have tumbled in the city-state, according to industry experts, and as Singapore authorities are increasing scrutiny of family offices in the wake of a record money-laundering scandal.\n\nLast August, Singaporean authorities arrested and charged 10 people — all with links to China — in connection to a $2.2bn money laundering and fraud investigation, the largest in Singapore’s history. Police also seized assets including luxury properties, cars, designer handbags, gold bars, cash and cryptocurrency in raids across the city.\n\nIn the wake of the probe, authorities have turned a closer eye on Singapore’s most affluent residents, visiting auto dealerships and real estate groups and warning in October that luxury assets including cars, watches and handbags may be subjected to anti-money laundering controls.\n\nPrivate bankers have also tightened due diligence processes for new clients, leading to longer waiting times to open accounts and set up family offices.\n\nCircle 33, which was famed for its extensive wine menu with prices that ran into six figures, came to symbolise the flow of wealth to Singapore during the pandemic, especially from super-rich Chinese fleeing draconian restrictions in mainland China.\n\nCo-founded by Zhang Tao, the co-founder of restaurant review site Dianping, and backed by Chinese business figures such as Min Fan, co-founder of travel group Ctrip, Circle 33 gained notoriety by attracting high-flying executives from China, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, according to multiple people who frequented the club.\n\n“It was printing money but members stopped going after it was spoken about in the media and earned a reputation,” said one person who visited the club on multiple occasions.\n\nAnother person close to the club said Circle 33 did not make enough money, forcing the owners to decide against renewing the lease.\n\nOn a recent visit by the Financial Times, there was no sign of Circle 33 at the villa on Scotts Road save for terracotta statues in the garden.\n\nJade Koh, who is listed as the general manager of Circle 33 on LinkedIn, declined to comment. The club does not have a website and its Google listing said it was permanently closed.\n\nWhile the money laundering investigation, which Singapore police said had been in progress for years, was announced after Circle 33’s quiet closure this summer, the scandal has swayed the city-state’s wealthy to avoid flaunting their privilege, especially as the cost of living rises.\n\n“The economy is not as robust,” said Aaron Goh, a high-end events planner for eXposure Entertainment, who has observed a drop-off in demand for personalised parties over the past six months.\n\nLee Lee Langdale, owner of Singolf Services, a club membership brokerage, said prices had been rising “until the money laundering case in August” thanks to demand from foreigners, especially from China. “Since then it has been really quiet,” she said.\n\nGolf clubs have also begun more strictly examining suspicious payments, she added, while membership prices have come down, with joining fees at Sentosa Golf Club falling from about S$950,000 to S$850,000 (US$709,000-US$635,000).\n\nSay Kwee Neng, a car industry consultant, said sales of luxury and super-luxury brands had also come under more scrutiny, on top of a targeted tax rise introduced last year.\n\n“Anecdotally, I heard stories of how the authorities were visiting authorised dealers for Porsche, Ferrari and Bentley,” he said. “Specifically they wanted to know why more detailed background checks weren’t conducted by the dealers to ascertain the source of funding for these people of interest.”\n\nHigher duties have also contributed to a fall in luxury home sales in the second half of last year, according to real estate industry experts.\n\n“The high-end market fuelled by foreigners was already softening due to higher stamp duty costs,” said one real estate agent specialising in foreign buyers. “The laundering scandal was the nail in the coffin.”",

Like its sister the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, it’s owned by Belmond. The VSOE has recently expanded its routes and connections in Europe; now the E&O is following suit, relaunching with a three-night Essence of Malaysia journey, with the original carriages – Japanese-built, specced-up even higher in Singapore – newly refurbished and ready to, ahem, roll.\n\nGuests board and disembark at Singapore’s Woodlands station for a round-trip journey with stops in Penang and Langkawi. On Penang, there are private guided tours of the historic shophouses of George Town, today full of art galleries, artisan boutiques and design studios, and excellent restaurants; you can also grab a map and a trishaw (like a rickshaw but with the driver at the back) and explore the Old Town yourself. On Langkawi, where the beaches are heaven and the rainforest more than 10mn years old, the activities skew to snorkelling, paddle-boarding and massages. Belmond trains are known for their cuisine, so no surprise they’ve enlisted André Chiang – his Restaurant André in Singapore was the city’s top-rated venue for years – to oversee the galleys here. belmond.com, from $2,400\n\nIntriguing news from the Finnish countryside, an hour outside Helsinki: Billnäs Gård, an early-20th-century villa-turned-hospitality project in the tiny, pretty riverside village of Billnäs. Its owners recently completed a several-year restoration that honours the genteel spirit of the original interiors with mod-con add-ons, both necessary and indulgent, including a saltwater swimming pool and a medicinal and herb garden adjacent to the traditional potager.\n\nThey plan to run Billnäs Gård part of the time as a small, intimate hotel, and part as a private villa for holidays and celebrations, with retreats of all sorts throughout the year. Six ensuite bedrooms are furnished with antiques, iconic contemporary Scandinavian designs and collectable 20th-century pieces, skilfully combined into vignettes. Two suites have small kitchens; one has a bathroom with a stunning tiled fireplace; in summer, a small cabin at the river’s edge joins the inventory. Already on the 2024 schedule are yoga and somatic healing retreats, as well as ones themed around healthy eating. billnasgard.fi, from about €430\n\nIs it ever too early to think summer? Arev Saint-Tropez opens next month on a quiet street tucked just outside the village itself, with 43 rooms designed by madrileño Luis Bustamante, who never met a primary colour he didn’t like. Be prepared for lots of cobalt, canary and cardinal, with elegant light-toned boiserie and well-judged interludes of white.\n\nThey’ve created a small square on the property that hosts rotating pop-up boutiques and a coffee-patisserie truck; if you prefer your croissant down in the village, there are bikes on hand for borrowing and a chauffeured Citroën Méhari EV. What they hope will be their masterstroke of genius: a revival of the Strand Restaurant and Champagne Lounge, which, some years back, turned over its Rue du Petit Bal premises – one of the oldest continuously operating restaurant spaces in the Côte d’Azur – to Villa Azur, and is reinvented here. arevcollection.com, from €590\n\nThe Cuyama Buckhorn, in California’s eastern Santa Barbara county, first opened in 1952 in New Cuyama — an oil-boom town conceived in an era of roadside fenced pools, common barbecue areas and ranch-influenced architecture with prefab leanings. Its LA-based owners (the city is a two-hour drive away) have retained quite a few of those midcentury traces, but mostly it feels like a very 2024 balance of high and low, with printed cement-tile floors, slick little minibars and floating platform beds with timber headboards in the 21 rooms.\n\nThere’s the Buck Stop Coffee Shop and Buckhorn Restaurant, where the drinks menu has garnered attention across central California (the expected regional wines, craft beers and mezcal cocktails are joined by sake and bourbon flights). The roadside pool has been joined by a bocce ball court and a dry sauna. Best of all might be the proximity to the Cuyama Valley, which is west-coast wildflower nirvana, home to its own mini version of California’s famous springtime “superbloom”. cuyamabuckhorn.com, from $250\n\n@mariashollenbarger",

He faces a penalty of up to S$100,000 and seven years in prison if found guilty of corruption.\n\nThe charges allege he received kickbacks totalling more than S$384,000 (US$285,770) in value between 2015 and 2022, according to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.\n\n“I reject the allegations in the charges and will now focus on clearing my name,” Iswaran said in a resignation letter made public by the office of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday. Iswaran added that he would return his salary and allowances received since the beginning of the investigation in July last year.\n\nLee said the government would continue to deal with the case “rigorously”.\n\n“I am determined to uphold the integrity of the party and the government, and our reputation for honesty and incorruptibility,” Lee said, referring to the ruling People’s Action party, of which Iswaran was also a member until his resignation this week. “Singaporeans expect no less.”\n\nThe charges came about six months after the anti-graft agency arrested Iswaran and Ong Beng Seng, one of the city-state’s most high-profile property tycoons. Both were released on bail.\n\nThe corruption watchdog said Iswaran received some of the alleged bribes for “advancing Ong’s business interests” in a contract between his company Singapore GP Pte and the Singapore Tourism Board, a government agency.\n\nAccording to a charge sheet seen by the Financial Times, the kickbacks allegedly included tickets to English Premier League football matches, Formula One races and plays including Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Hamilton and Kinky Boots, as well as a business class flight from Doha to Singapore in 2022.\n\nIswaran, who previously served as Singapore’s minister of communications and of trade and industry, was instrumental in bringing the Formula One Grand Prix to Singapore in partnership with Ong in 2007.\n\nOng has not been charged. He is the founder of Hotel Properties, which has brands such as the Four Seasons and Intercontinental in its property portfolio. The company has previously said that Ong was providing details of his dealings with Iswaran to the watchdog.\n\nSingapore GP Pte declined to comment. The Singapore Tourism Board did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ong declined to comment.\n\nThe corruption case comes amid mounting scandals for the ruling party, which faces a crucial leadership transition this year.\n\nPrime Minister Lee is set to hand over power to his deputy Lawrence Wong as soon as November, in what will only be the fourth change of leadership in Singapore’s history. In 2025, the country will go to the polls in a race that PAP, which has ruled Singapore uninterrupted since independence in 1965, is again expected to win.\n\nLee said last year that the graft accusations against Iswaran and Ong, along with the resignations of two senior PAP lawmakers over an “inappropriate relationship”, had hit the party’s reputation.\n\nSingapore’s ministers are among the highest paid in the world, earning about S$1mn a year, in part to discourage corruption. The last graft case in Singapore involving a minister was in 1986.",

    "body": "The international art market moves to the Indo-Pacific this week for the second edition of ART SG in Singapore (January 19-21, Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre). Coinciding with Singapore Art Week and notable museum show openings, the fair has generated a “step up of activity in town” this year, according to its co-founder Magnus Renfrew.\n\nSupport from the region’s individual collectors bolsters many events, including at the so-called Private Museum, which is in fact a hybrid non-profit charity founded by the real estate developer Daniel Teo and his daughter Rachel Teo in 2010. Shows here include works from 15 members of “Art Addicts Anonymous” — an informal WhatsApp group that has become a thriving collectors circle — and of art owned by Pierre Lorinet, a financier-turned-philanthropist who is a member of ART SG’s 26-person advisory group. Elsewhere, the British curator Zoé Whitley organises an exhibition of 100 artists from Africa and Asia at Gillman Barracks for The Institutum, founded by the international collector Andreas Teoh.\n\nRenfrew notes the acceleration of money flowing into Singapore, including through its thriving biotech and tech sectors. This year’s edition of the fair is however nearly a third smaller than its inaugural edition — with about 110 galleries versus 160 in 2023 — which, Renfrew says, reflects that galleries are “having to make short-term, pragmatic decisions” in a softer market. But, he says, “given the wider context of the ascent of Singapore’s relevance geopolitically and geo-economically, ART SG has the potential to play a role in building a key cultural and art market hub over the coming years.”\n\nTwo Australians who forged their careers in London have moved back and will open a new gallery in Sydney on February 24. Tania Doropoulos, previously artistic director of Frieze London and Frieze Studios, and Matt Glenn, a former director at Sadie Coles gallery, have identified a “generational shift” among gallerists and collectors in Australia and believe that now is a good time to begin catering to the widening demand. The art market’s move towards Asia is among the dynamics helping to put Australia on the map, they say.\n\nThe gallery will be called “Palas”, to invoke a sense of palatial hospitality, and so spelt after “an accident between an artist and an artificial intelligence”, Doropoulos says. The two-story space is in the city’s fast-developing Zetland area, and opens with a show of new silkscreen paintings by Marco Fusinato (US$35,000-$45,000). Fusinato represented Australia in the 2022 Venice Biennale, participating every day in a performance that ran for the event’s 200-day run.\n\nThe Palas founders plan to join the international art fair circuit, they say. “Artists here want to engage more internationally but it can be a very difficult leap, without physically relocating to the northern hemisphere, which can take years out of their practice,” Glenn says. Doropoulos adds that there is also demand from artists outside of Australia to build their profile there. “The biennial and museum sectors are showing a much better exchange but the gallery sector is not as participatory overseas,” she says. Other shows in the pipeline include those of the Irish artist Eva Rothschild, who also recently represented her country at Venice, and Canada’s Tamara Henderson.\n\nExperimenting with a new business model is Matt Carey-Williams, who left Victoria Miro gallery in London last year and is now setting up solo. His venture will have a physical space — at 12 Porchester Place near Marble Arch — where he will hang about 10 small and short shows a year, each a “close up” of one artist. The first of these “Scenes” runs February 6-March 2 with work by Glen Pudvine (b1989, £3,500-£11,000), whom Carey-Williams first encountered at Pudvine’s Royal Academy Schools’ graduate show. It’s at this level that Carey-Williams feels he can really make a difference, offering exhibitions without demanding official representation. “There is a real thirst for artists who haven’t even graduated yet, which is risky for everyone, especially the artist,” he says.\n\nHe will supplement the Scene showings with “Episodes”, larger-scale group exhibitions based on a theme, which will run in different venues around the world. The first of these, Bump, will be at Frieze’s 9 Cork Street building, March 7-23, and will comprise 21 artists including Marc Dennis, Clare Woods and Flora Yukhnovich (prices up to $140,000). Carey-Williams says he is likely to go to Seoul for a future Episode in the autumn.\n\nHot on the heels of his Blackness, White, and Light exhibition that closed this month at the Mumok museum in Vienna, American artist Adam Pendleton gets his first solo gallery show in New York for more than 10 years at Pace from May 3. The show, including 20 recent paintings and works on paper, is an extension of the Vienna exhibition — which itself was a continuation of his best-known series, Black Dada and introduced colour for the first time. The Pace works will be priced between $65,000 and $450,000.\n\nThe artist’s “nearly continuous institutional exhibitions over the past 10 years”, including also at New York’s Museum of Modern Art and the KW Institute of Contemporary Art in Berlin, are a reason why it has taken so long for him to have a commercial show in his home town, says Samanthe Rubell, president of Pace, which has represented the artist since 2012. The artist, who explores the relationship between blackness and abstraction, is “one of the most relevant working today” and “reflects how we experience the world in the 21st century through its palpable feeling of everything happening at once”, she says.\n\nInstitutional demand has not exactly cooled — also in the planning is a large-scale, site-specific commission for the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington DC, slated for Spring 2025.\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow FTWeekend on Instagram and X, and subscribe to our podcast Life and Art wherever you listen",

    "body": "The Mexican revolution was finally over. The civil wars and agrarian uprisings that overthrew a dictator and established a constitutional republic ushered in a new era of Mexican nationalism. In Frida Kahlo’s “Self-Portrait with Monkey” (1945), the artist, dressed in a robe from the indigenous Tehuana people of Mexico, trusty spider monkey at her shoulder, throws us a haughty glance from under her unibrow. Celebrating pre-colonial cultures and female empowerment, this self-portrait captures a mood of defiance and confidence.\n\nContrast this with “Self-Portrait” (1958) by Patrick Ng, rendered a year after the Federation of Malaya, formerly British Malaya, became independent. The artist, a Chinese man, has depicted himself as a Malay woman. The queering (from man to woman, Chinese to Malay) makes this a slippery painting. On one level, it seems to be expressing ambivalence about “Malayanisation”, a national development programme to build a homogenous identity in a multiracial state. But it could also be read as a vision of a future society of radical fluidity, where typical markers of identity can be transcended.\n\nTwo self-portraits made during periods of national transformation; two very different moods. They are placed side by side in Tropical: Stories from Southeast Asia and Latin America at National Gallery Singapore, billed as the first major comparative survey of art from the two regions. One of its propositions is that self-portraiture was a strategy that artists from both sides of the globe used to comment on societal change and to imagine new worlds.\n\nBut is this a strategy exclusive to these regions? Self-portraits have everywhere and always offered commentary and vision. Beyond this, the show connects the art from diverse territories under a grand narrative of anti-imperialist resistance and sundry other rebellions. Besides self-portraiture, other threads in the show include the incorporation of local traditions, such as in the stacked totems of Rubem Valentim that reference Afro-Brazilian customs, as well as the innovative use of crafts, as seen in Barbara Sansoni’s geometric handwoven textile works suspended from the ceiling.\n\nTo unite all this, the curators propose a concept called “Tropical”, described as a “defiant attitude” that “allowed for the most imaginative possibilities to emerge even from the most trying of circumstances”. While not very illuminating (even verging on reductive, as it suggests that equatorial types are governed by their passions), it does generate an atmosphere of solidarity: the tropical as a hothouse space of restless ferment and unruly fecundity.\n\nIs this convincing? Only if you take “tropicality” as a poetic mood or a speculative proposition, which allows for some fudging of timescales and the fusing of diverse liberatory struggles. The sweeping concept takes some serious creative licence and does not properly account for global conditions. The curators propose that although independence in both regions happened at different periods — most of Latin America between 1808 and 1826, south-east Asia between 1945 and 1957 — their art histories followed similar trajectories and can be mapped on to each other. But as this is mostly a 20th-century painting show, the Latin American artists are mischaracterised by this line of reasoning; by that time, some of them were fighting local dictators rather than colonial overlords.\n\nBut this is an ambitious and meaningful project. As interest in the art from the Global South grows, there is particular focus on south-to-south exchanges. Here, two regions occupying peripheral roles within a “global” history of Eurocentric modernism have placed themselves centrestage. White people are not invited, with the exception of Paul Gauguin, who opens the exhibition as a common enemy. His “Poor Fisherman” (1896), showing a naked native from French Polynesia drinking from a coconut shell, exemplifies lingering stereotypes of the tropics as idle, primitive and backward.\n\nOver the course of the show, this trope gets soundly rebutted by more than 200 artworks showing labour, resistance and futuristic visions of Global South solidarity (even before the term was coined). The argument is borne out in three sections, roughly chronological in order. The Myth of the Lazy Native explores how artists resisted European representations of colonial subjects in a series of figurative paintings that celebrate local life, industry and cultures. Here, we have a Brazilian fruit-seller on a boat with a wonderful expression of bored disdain (Tarsila do Amaral, “The Fruit Seller”, 1925), a Mexican woman making tortillas (Diego Rivera, “Woman Grinding Maize”, 1924) and a street-theatre performance in Jakarta (Hendra Gunawan, “Monkey Dance”).\n\nThe second section, This Earth of Mankind, roughly maps on to the post-independence period, in which artists grappled with national identities and melded traditions with experimentation. As part of the exhibition’s populist manoeuvres, a mirror has been put between two Indonesian modern masters for visitors to take selfies. On the left, we have Chinese-born Lee Man Fong’s careful self-portrait dressed in a tropics-appropriate white T-shirt and surrounded by Greek statues, signalling his parity with European traditions; on the right, the Indonesian artist Affandi’s visage composed of chaotic squiggles, achieved by squeezing tubes of paint directly on to the canvas and smudging them around with his fingers. Following them is a pageant of self-portraits that eventually culminates in an exploration of how artists elevated craft traditions to art.\n\nFinally, The Subversive brings us to the present day. This is where the exhibition becomes the most multidisciplinary, with installations, videos and sculpture. Curatorially, it’s a bit of a free-for-all: so long as the artist is challenging something, she’s in. But it ends up being the strongest section. Liberated from a linear narrative, the works speak a language of defiance, fierceness, sensuality and mystery. Bali’s I Gusti Ayu Kadek Murniasih’s sinuous figures with explicit genitalia upend sexual conservatism with joyous lasciviousness.\n\nIt is also here that the western category of “art” gets destabilised by Singaporean Malay artist Mohammad Din Mohammad’s talismanic paintings. As a Sufi mystic and healer, his works are packed with pieces of wood, animal bone and shells in crowded compositions which are believed to be therapeutic to the viewer. One wonders whether “tropical” could involve a fusion of different paradigms, such as art, spirituality and medicine, which make up singular practices in the Global South that cannot be easily assimilated into western aesthetic categories? In any case, this exhibition is a starting point for imagining how we can broaden the ways we narrate creative processes from around the world.\n\nTo March 24, nationalgallery.sg",

    "body": "This article is part of a guide to Singapore from FT Globetrotter\n\nWhile Singapore has long been a bastion of fine dining, its award-winning repertoire over the years has tended to lean French or Japanese. In recent years, however, a slew of young, talented chefs has challenged this stance — and the misconception that local (which, due to the city-state’s history as a trading post in the 19th and 20th centuries, can be anything from Chinese, Malay, Indian and Peranakan) had to be “cheaper.”\n\nThese cuisines, as well as those from neighbouring states, were previously mostly found only at hawker stalls and casual joints. Today, they can also be enjoyed on multi-course tasting menus, proudly celebrating their respective chefs’ heritages.\n\nThis shift began with the birth of “mod-Sin”, or modern Singapore cuisine, attributed to chef Willin Low, who coined the term in 2005 to describe his cuisine at the now-closed Wild Rocket. There, he recreated the hawker favourite char kway teow using thinly sliced cuttlefish in place of noodles, and topped stir-fried Hokkien mee with luscious king prawns.\n\nMod-Sin has continued to gain momentum. In 2014, banker-turned-chef Han Liguang opened Labyrinth, serving progressive Singaporean flavours and sourcing the vast majority of ingredients locally (a particular feat in a state where limited agricultural production means that more than 90 per cent of food is imported from overseas). When Busan-born chef Sun Kim opened his first iteration of Meta in 2016, he specialised in French-inspired fare. But he has since shifted towards highlighting his Korean heritage and its produce, with the famed abalone from Jeju Island now a mainstay on his menus. And at his namesake restaurant Thevar, which opened in 2018, chef Mano Thevar translates his Indian heritage into modern dishes.\n\nThe critics started paying attention: in recent years, all of these restaurants were awarded Michelin stars and ranked on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list.\n\nBut that was just the beginning. As soon as the Covid-19 stay-at-home orders were no longer in place, a new wave of young south-east and East Asian chefs opened their own fine-dining restaurants — or completely refreshed an existing one — with their respective heritages as a focal point. Below are five of the most exciting places that celebrate the vastness of the region’s cuisines.\n\nSeroja serves multi-course tasting menus that pay tribute to the vast flavours and culinary traditions of the Malay Archipelago, heralding 29-year-old chef-owner Kevin Wong’s homeland. Since opening last year, it has been awarded a Michelin star, as well as a Michelin Green star for its sustainability efforts (Singapore’s first), while Wong himself picked up Michelin’s Young Chef nod too, which recognises rising stars in the culinary world.\n\nDiners begin a meal at Seroja with delicate one-bite wonders, such as obsiblue prawns in a caramelised sambal hitam (a black chilli paste), anchovies topped with finely shredded leek, or barbecue eel with sare roti (wherein the flatbread is seasoned with sare, a seaweed found abundantly in the Malay Peninsula, that has been dried and turned into a powder). This is usually followed by a memorable bread course: Malaysian roti paung (aka butter buns) that are steamed before being deep-fried. Soft, pillowy and crisp on the edges, the pull-apart roti is served with a hand-dived scallop on an aromatic laksa sauce that’s perfect to dip the bread in.\n\nOther highlights include nasi dagang (made with a heirloom red rice grown for 3,000 years by the Lun Bawang tribe in Sarawak) that is anointed with coconut and ginger scallion oil, and served with coral trout on percik, a Malaysian barbecue sauce. Served alongside: chutney and herb sambal, with sides of chayote (a green squash) and a cucumber-coconut salad, altogether offering sweet, savoury and umami flavours all at once. “It’s like in south-east Asian homes where, when we eat, we have a lot of side dishes,” Wong adds.\n\nEven if you don’t have a sweet tooth, make space for dessert: the Borneo raw-sugar bahulu, a traditional Malay pastry, baked in handmade brassware from the Malaysian state of Terengganu, is delightful and cannot be missed.\n\nMalaysian culture is thoughtfully integrated into Seroja’s space — an art installation by the entrance is inspired by ketupat, which Wong explains is a local way of making rice cakes. Just behind, the Seroja signage on the hostess’s podium is inspired by wayang kulit, a regional folk art of shadow puppetry. The ceiling above the chefs’ counter (which is where one should aim to sit to take in the action in the kitchen) is an illustration of the Malay Archipelago.\n\nIn addition to providing a platform for Malay farmers, fishers and artists, Seroja uses a compost garden and has built a rooftop garden-farm where they source their tropical vegetables and herbs. They also collect and recycle rainwater.\n\nMalcolm Lee’s Candlenut is the world’s first Peranakan restaurant to receive a Michelin star, and has held on to this distinction since 2016, the year the guide made its debut in Singapore. He has long championed his Peranakan heritage (also referred to as Straits Chinese: generally a person of mixed Chinese and Malay/Indonesian lineage) in various iterations, from the ah-ma-kase menu (a play on the words omakase and ah-ma, which means “grandmother” in Hokkien) at Candlenut to his favourite ingredient, the poisonous fruit of the buah keluak tree (which is made edible by fermentation).\n\nHis latest venue, Pangium, opened last year at the Singapore Botanic Gardens’ eight-hectare Gallop Extension. Here he serves tasting menus on minimalist ceramics that celebrate contemporary Straits cuisine, which he describes as “the food our forebears first created with the knowledge, ingredients and tools they had on hand upon sailing down south-east Asia in search of a better life”.\n\nThe menu during my last visit was themed to the Lunar New Year — an ode to the Chinese migrants who made Singapore home. Pang susi, the Eurasian sweet potato bun, was filled with Iberico pork cheek, though as a pescatarian I enjoyed a version with turmeric blue swimmer crab curry, its sugary crust giving way to a beautiful sweet and savoury finish. Buah keluak was mixed into a wok-fried rice with lobster and free-range eggs, lending to an earthy, umami-laden dish. Fish moolie, a dish believed to have originated in Kerala, was served here with toothfish (a type of sea bass) and scallops.\n\nThe multi-course menu changes every three months, and Lee says they are tied to “the whole vision of exploring and rediscovering Straits cuisine” — for the most recent one, he “looked at old recipes and stories, like a salad recipe from a 1960s cookbook called laksa siam”.\n\nDining here at lunchtime offers serene 180-degree views overlooking the Unesco World Heritage site, with the feeling of being in a treehouse in the middle of a forest — although in the evening, the minimalist space can be romantic (tables are generously spaced out, too).\n\nChinese-Malaysian Zor Tan, who grew up in Malaysia, used to be known as the lauded chef André Chiang’s right hand, having worked alongside him at Restaurant André in Singapore, Raw in Taipei and Sichuan Moon in Macau.\n\nIn June 2022, after working with Chiang for 11 years, Tan finally opened his own venture, Born, in the former Jinrikisha station, a heritage building. It has one of the most stunning dining rooms in the country, with an eye-catching paper sculpture by Dutch artist Peter Gentenaar hanging from the ceiling.\n\nHere, Tan serves what he calls “contemporary” cuisine inspired by his childhood memories, professional journey and personal ideas. His menu is made up of nine courses that span the “Circle of Life”, based on the Chinese philosophy that what comes to an end will restart again.\n\nEach dish — rooted in Chinese ingredients (from his Hokkien ancestry to Cantonese, Sichuan, and Taiwanese influences from his work and lived experiences) — is prepared dexterously with classic technique in an exciting interplay of flavours.\n\nOn the menu that I had, the taro puff, for instance, is based on the gula Melaka (palm sugar originating from the state of Malacca in Malaysia) puffs his mother used to make while he was growing up. At Born, it is a savoury snack, deep-fried taro with a molten salted egg custard centre, topped with grated bottarga. He relates this to “vicissitude”, or how his family has progressed from humble beginnings through the years. His signature dish, monkfish, steamed and finished over binchotan (Japanese oak-wood charcoal) is served with fermented imperial chilli, jade fungus from the Yunnan mountains and Sichuan peppers, is a tribute to his time living and working in Macau.\n\nDessert came in the form of toasted rice cream, topped with milk ice cream, puffed rice, chestnut purée, and black garlic and sable — Tan’s take on the classic Mont Blanc dessert, inspired by how rice is often the last dish at Chinese celebratory dinners.\n\nThe amuse-bouches at Nae:um were presented in an adorable way: kim mari (fried seaweed roll), yuzu tomato and Korean fried cauliflower centred around figurines of a boy and girl kissing on a picnic. I must have taken 20 photos from every angle as I decided which one to post on Instagram.\n\nLittle did I know that was just the beginning of an artful tasting menu (even the actual menu itself features a watercolour illustration) where each dish was as striking as the other. South Korea-born chef-patron Louis Han calls his contemporary tasting menus “Episodes” — compendiums of his memories of growing up in Seoul (and, in the future, of his time spent abroad), each of which runs for six months. Han worked in kitchens in Lebanon (where he volunteered to serve with the UN Peacekeeping force) and Abu Dhabi before coming to Singapore, and working at chef Sun Kim’s Meta and Kimme restaurants.\n\nWhen I dined at the blond-wood 28-seat space, the theme was the Han river, which chef Han says “brings everyone together in Korea” — hence those picnicking figurines. Other standouts included sliced striped jack (white travelly) and kimchi draped over thin buckwheat noodles; a beautiful milssam roll, with prawns delicately encased in a Korean crepe; deopbap rice with black truffle, morels and mushrooms; and kkul hotteok (Korean sweet pancakes), served with glutinous rice, honeycomb and caramelised fig.\n\nLocated in a shophouse, Lolla has been around since 2012. It used to be a Spanish tapas restaurant, but in 2020 had a refresh when Philippine-born Johanne Siy became head chef. Siy had stints at La Bernardin and Café Boulud in New York, Faviken in Sweden and Noma in Copenhagen, and worked with André Chiang at Restaurant André, each influencing her style of cooking. While her culinary training is modern European, she draws much of her inspiration from her Filipino heritage. “Rather than doing a take on a complete dish, I take elements which capture the essence of the dish and incorporate them into my cuisine,” Siy explains.\n\nFor instance, Siy’s signature avocado dish is inspired by kinilaw, the Filipino “ceviche”. “I wanted to create a bright dish that’s reminiscent of kinilaw from back home — lots of acidity, brightness and complexity to get the appetite going,” Siy says. While there are other interpretations of kinilaw at Lolla, with different souring agents, aromatics and spices, with this one “there’s acid in the form of citrus, heat from chillies, freshness from cucumber and richness from coconut milk”.\n\nAnother signature, the crab relleno, is Siy’s take on the stuffed crab dishes usually served at fiestas and gatherings in the Philippines, taken to the next level. She uses three kinds of crab — blue, snow and river — tied together with one of her favourite ingredients from the Philippines, aligue, an umami-rich paste made from crab tomalley (or crab “roe”) gathered from small river crabs. This velvety, bright orange indulgence is layered above a bed of pearl couscous, and topped with smoked paprika foam, Kaffir lime and mustard flowers to balance the richness.\n\n“I get a lot of comments from diners that even if the dishes don’t necessarily look Filipino, the flavour profiles are Filipino,” she says. On the à la carte menu, Lolla offers the classic Filipino dish of adobo, with charred smoky quail served with a distilled vinegar-soy sauce and an egg-yolk confit, which sometimes makes an appearance on the tasting menu. It is not to be missed.\n\nWhich Singapore restaurant in your opinion is best for mod-Sin?

    "body": "The global queue to set up a family office in Singapore has stretched to as long as 18 months, with a backlog of wealthy investors encountering stricter new regulations in the Asian financial hub.\n\nFamily offices boomed during the pandemic and have come to symbolise Singapore’s ambitions as an investment destination, but are under additional scrutiny after the city-state’s biggest money laundering probe.\n\nThe number of Singapore-registered family offices, which manage tens of billions of dollars of private wealth, has leapt from just 50 in 2018 to 1,100 at the end of 2022, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\nBut lawyers and advisers involved in setting up family offices said the pace of new registrations has slowed, with demand now falling as processing times stretch from less than six months to in some cases as long as 18 months.\n\nThe extended wait time, the people said, was the result of a backlog of existing applications and greater scrutiny under new, stricter criteria from Singaporean authorities. The long wait time is deterring some potential clients.\n\n“Family offices remain popular, but we are seeing a slowdown,” said Kia Meng Loh, co-head of private wealth and family office practices at Dentons Rodyk. He said the number of inquiries from wealthy families and individuals had declined from two to three a week to “two to three per month”.\n\nThe delays varied, however, with some clients who applied last year still waiting for approval, while others who applied in January this year receiving the green light as soon as August, he added.\n\nThat disparity points to growing regulatory concern that the vehicles could be used by criminal enterprises, lawyers in the city-state said. Private banking clients have also faced longer wait times to open accounts due to tighter due diligence, the Financial Times previously reported.\n\nSingapore was rocked by the revelation in August of a S$2.8bn (US$2bn) money-laundering scandal, as police seized assets including luxury properties, cars, designer handbags, gold bars, cash and cryptocurrency in raids across the city-state. Ten individuals, all of whom originated in mainland China, have been arrested and charged.\n\nInvestigators are examining whether part of those funds found their way into family offices and whether they benefited from tax incentives for the vehicles.\n\n“If you are from certain jurisdictions, I was told recently to expect a waiting period of 18 months. But it can be less than that,” said one Singapore-based lawyer who asked not to be named. “I think everyone now is being more cautious after the money laundering investigation.”\n\nSingapore’s government has encouraged the opening of family offices as it seeks a competitive edge over Hong Kong, seeking wealthy investors from around the world. The city-state’s financial regulator calculated that family offices held about S$90bn in assets at the end of 2021.\n\n“The family office regime is very important for Singapore as a finance and asset management hub, and the government has put a lot of work into expanding and finessing it,” said Sudip Baniya, business development director for private wealth at IQ-EQ.\n\nBaniya confirmed the slowdown in family office registrations this year, mostly from the greater China region, but said it was “not a drastic decline”. While some cases had been waiting for 18 months, more often it was closer to 12 months, depending on the complexity of the application, he said.\n\nThe MAS began to impose additional restrictions on family offices in July, including setting a minimum fund size of S$20mn. At least S$200,000 must be invested annually in local businesses such as start-ups or the stock market.\n\nIt also required family offices to hire two investment professionals, at least one of whom comes from outside the client family, and has proposed additional measures such as hiring an MAS-regulated financial institution to check for money laundering.\n\n“MAS continues to receive a high volume of applications for tax incentives by Single Family Offices (SFOs).  They are generally processed in 9-12 months upon submission of complete information and supporting documents that are in good order but may take longer depending on the complexity and merits of each case,” MAS said.\n\n“The screening process by MAS has also lengthened in view of the more stringent criteria for tax incentives announced in 2022 and 2023 and greater scrutiny following the money laundering arrests in August 2023,” it added.\n\nRyan Lin, a director at Bayfront Law, added he had seen a 20 to 30 per cent slowdown in deal flow from clients. “Most [family offices] are putting cash in money market funds and fixed deposits to wait for opportunities,” he said.\n\nLoh of Dentons Rodyk said under the new criteria, more family offices were pursuing deals in areas such as private equity and there might be a “natural culling” of the number of family offices in the coming months.\n\n“Some wealthy individuals may decide putting money in a high-interest private bank account is better than spending $200,000 each year,” he said.\n\n",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week we’re taking a look at a potential new crypto arms race\n\nSingapore has given blockchain firm Paxos an in-principle green light to issue a stablecoin — a kind of crypto token pegged to a hard currency.\n\nThe firm plans to launch the cryptocurrency through its new Singaporean entity. It will be pegged to the US dollar and fully backed one for one by the dollar and cash equivalents.\n\nClose followers of the crypto sector will remember Paxos as the issuer behind BUSD, the Binance-branded stablecoin that has faded to near-irrelevancy ever since falling foul of New York regulators earlier this year.\n\nNevertheless the Paxos approval marks a potential change of fortune for the crypto sector’s record in Singapore, after the collapse of several high-profile projects in the city state, including crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and stablecoin operator Terraform Labs.\n\nSingapore state-owned investor Temasek was also forced to write off its $275mn stake in former industry bellwether FTX after the exchange’s famous collapse into bankruptcy a year ago. Temasek has said its trust in FTX’s former chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried — now convicted of fraud and other charges — appeared “misplaced”.\n\nReaders of this newsletter will know that the UK has already laid its stablecoin cards on the table, setting out guidelines to regulate the digital tokens in a bid to try to facilitate their use as a payment option for everyday goods and services.\n\nSo Singapore’s fresh embrace of a key digital assets market one week later might lead you to believe the international stablecoin arms race is heating up, especially as the large shadow cast by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and its crypto crackdown appears to be here to stay.\n\nWhile it’s tempting to suggest that the US’s actions on crypto open the door for the sector to boom elsewhere, the available data doesn’t seem to back up the claim.\n\nThere is little compelling evidence to suggest demand exists for dollar-pegged stablecoins in Singapore, or even in Asia as a whole.\n\nIdentifying the parts of the world where stablecoin interest is highest is a challenge: crypto traders often use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to disguise their location from the prying eyes of regulators or governments that don’t take kindly to crypto trading.\n\nInterest in the market can still be gauged by measuring the largest trading pairs between the world’s sovereign currencies and largest stablecoins. If, for example, one of the top fiat trading pairs for Tether — the world’s largest dollar-pegged token — is the Singaporean dollar, it would be fair to deduce that traders from the city state represent one of the stablecoin’s most popular markets.\n\nBut, according to numbers provided by industry data platform CCData, the top five trading pairs for Tether’s USDT token are the US dollar and the euro, followed by the Turkish lira, Thai baht and the British pound.\n\nThe outlook for Singapore’s stablecoin push doesn’t improve when you look at Circle’s USDC stablecoin, the second-largest token of its kind with roughly $24bn circulating in the market. Predictably, the US dollar and the euro lead the way, trailed this time by the pound, baht and the Australian dollar.\n\nOther notable stablecoins include DAI — an algorithmic cryptocurrency much like the failed Terra token of 2022 — and BUSD, which, despite hemorrhaging market share since its issuance was banned by the New York State Department of Financial Services, still remains the fifth-largest stablecoin in the market.\n\nSignificant trading pairs for these tokens again offer little encouragement for a city state trying to reassert its grip on crypto markets: the Korean won, Brazilian real and Mexican peso all make notable entries for these tokens, while the Singaporean dollar is nowhere to be seen.\n\nPaxos’s push into Singapore, according to Paxos’s head of strategy Walter Hessert, is fueled by its ambition to “open the financial system to everyone, introducing significant opportunities to global markets and billions of users”.\n\nBut since its $188bn peak in April last year, the stablecoin market cap has fallen roughly 33 per cent to $126bn today. So while Paxos tries to break new ground in Singapore, it is doing so in a market that is not expanding.\n\nWhat’s your take on Singapore’s most recent crypto moves? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nDuring a congressional hearing on illicit activity in the digital assets industry, president of consulting firm Dynamic Securities Analytics, Alison Jimenez, said US legislation aimed at reeling in the crypto sector may not protect consumers against bad actors in the space.\n\nBlackRock’s foray into the crypto space continued this week after the world’s largest asset manager filed with the SEC for a spot ethereum exchange traded fund.\n\nThe price of ether jumped modestly as a result, but you might also recall when the price of bitcoin surged a few weeks ago on inaccurate reports that BlackRock’s application for another spot ETF tracking bitcoin had been approved by the SEC.\n\nThis week, the speculative nature of the crypto market was seen again when yet another faked filing hit the crypto market, this time for a iShares XRP Trust registered in Delaware. A BlackRock representative told the FT it had not filed for an XRP Trust, but the price of the XRP briefly surged nonetheless.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is this week edited by Laurence Fletcher.

    "blurb": "Singapore’s tech-focused sovereign wealth fund says established companies are seeing AI wins with existing customers",
    "date": "2023-11-1400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s GIC, one of the world’s largest institutional investors, has advised “doubling down” on Big Tech rather than overvalued start-ups in the booming generative artificial intelligence sector.\n\nLim Chow Kiat, chief executive of the $700bn sovereign wealth fund, said tech giants such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta had begun capturing “a lot of value” in the transformative technology with their existing customers.\n\n“Customers are paying for [their services] already. So, actually, that is quite a good place for investors to double down on,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. Valuations of start-ups with AI business models were “too high”, he added. “We need to be careful not to get sucked into the hype. But it is more important not to lose interest.”\n\nGenerative AI companies, whose technology can create imagery to order and humanlike text in seconds, have raised billions of dollars this year. Major tech companies have predicted that AI will drive their revenues, with Microsoft taking an early lead in incorporating it into its products, helped by its large stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nGIC, which manages Singapore’s foreign exchange reserves, does not detail its investments or break down its portfolio by sector, but it does so by region. Its investments in the US rose to 38 per cent of its portfolio for the 12 months to March this year, against 37 per cent a year earlier, compared with a dip in Asia, excluding Japan, from 25 per cent to 23 per cent.\n\nBut it was one of the earliest institutional and sovereign investors to embrace tech, in an attempt to keep the tiny financial hub abreast of the latest innovations.\n\nOf GIC’s $52bn invested in listed companies, $17.4bn is in the tech hardware and semiconductor sector, according to Bloomberg data. Its biggest current holdings in listed tech companies are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ($11.1bn), DoorDash ($2.1bn), Sony ($1.56bn) and MediaTek ($1.25bn). This does not capture all of GIC’s investments in public equities, which make up 30 per cent of the fund’s more than $700bn portfolio.\n\nCompanies in its AI portfolio include UK analytics group Quantexa; Hong Kong data company MioTech; US AI software and hardware provider SambaNova Systems; and US-Israeli fintech Pagaya Technologies.\n\nBoth GIC, as well as Singapore’s other state investor Temasek, have described AI’s potential as transformative for business.\n\nBut the frenzy since the launch of the ChatGPT chatbot a year ago has prompted warnings from experts that most start-ups in the sector are overvalued and will fail to make money. AI has similarly stretched the market caps of big tech companies, with trillions added to their collective valuations since last year.\n\nVenture capital firms and larger investors, including sovereign wealth funds, have watched from the sidelines as Big Tech has forged deeper relationships with the top generative AI start-ups. This year, Microsoft has invested billions of dollars more into OpenAI and backed rival Inflection. Alphabet and Amazon have committed up to $6bn to Anthropic.\n\nThe companies have been preferred partners because only they can provide the combination of computing power and capital required to build foundation models. In turn, they have received preferential access to AI tools, and are expected to recoup much of their investment from AI start-ups’ spending on their cloud services.\n\nInfrastructure is another important area for investors, including GIC. “We believe there will be an infrastructure layer for AI the same way there was for the transition to the cloud,” said its chief.\n\nAmazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet have boosted investment in cloud computing infrastructure over the past few years. Bank of America analysts predict that the collective cloud-related capex of the three will rise at an accelerated 22 per cent next year to $116bn.\n\nSingapore has taken a more collaborative approach with AI to date, rather than seeking to regulate it. In an annual letter in July on GIC’s performance, Lim warned that there were legitimate concerns that generative AI was being developed too quickly. He cited deepfakes, fake news and cyber attacks.\n\n“Different investors have different ways of cutting the [AI] value chain, but . . . whatever way we cut [it], we have to remember that it is a long game,” he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by George Hammond in San Francisco and Mary McDougall in London",

    "blurb": "Parents are looking to Hong Kong and Singapore’s top ranked institutions ",
    "date": "2023-11-0700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Wealthy Asian families are increasingly sending their younger generations to study at homegrown universities, as the region’s powerful economies present greater opportunities for business connections — and business expansion.\n\nWhere once rich dynasties favoured American and European establishments for their children’s undergraduate and postgraduate studies, advisers report that many are now opting for the highly-ranked universities in mainland China, Hong Kong and the wider Asia Pacific region.\n\n“There is definitely a growing interest and trend for Asia to become a preferred destination for higher education,” says Winnie Qian Peng, director of the Roger King Center for Asian Family Business and Family Office at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\n“For a long time, Asia was far behind the US. Now it’s not,” Peng explains. “It’s therefore very natural that people would view Asia as a good place to study and to work, because that could be the future growth driver.”\n\nWhile the traditionally leading universities of the US and UK are still highly sought after by many wealthy Chinese families, for both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, Peng says a growing number of rich mainland Chinese families want their children to study at institutions in the region because they have become highly rated internationally.\n\nHong Kong is home to five of the world’s top 100 universities according to the latest edition of QS’s world university rankings, including HKUST, while mainland China has another five, including Tsinghua and Peking universities. Singapore has two in the top 100: the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University.\n\nPeng points out that the number of applications for HKUST’s Master of Science in Finance programme this year was double the pre-pandemic level — with many now coming from mainland China.\n\n“You may find people with similar backgrounds from all those wealthy families, children studying together and becoming classmates,” she says. “This becomes guanxi — a connection — people actually value this a lot, especially in the Asian context.”\n\nUS-China tensions, which made it more difficult for some mainland Chinese students to apply to study in the US, have prompted more to look to Hong Kong and Singapore. Japan and South Korea’s universities are also gaining momentum, Peng adds.\n\nHong Kong’s low tax rates are a further attraction for global families. Meanwhile, Singapore remains a hotspot following an influx of Chinese investors during the pandemic — even though the city-state recently doubled its property tax for foreigners. It is particularly appealing to wealthy Chinese families who wish their second and third generations to gain overseas residency and passports.\n\nChi-man Kwan, chief executive of Raffles Family Office, a multi-family office dually based in Hong Kong and Singapore, says that, when it comes to deciding on a higher education destination, many wealthy parents will factor in where their family businesses are based, and where they plan to expand their business footprint.\n\n“If I am an entrepreneur in Greater China, and I am looking to expand to south-east Asia, the best place to make my headquarters is very likely Singapore,” Kwan says. “If you are a European family or an American family, [and] your family business is doing very well . . . eventually — maybe this generation but for sure the next generation — Asia and Greater China is definitely going to play a big part of it.”\n\nWealth managers in the region say that setting up a family trust is usually the best way of facilitating, and financing, a cross-border university move. Family trusts are well suited to planning for a student’s life abroad in Asia, they argue, because they can be registered in Hong Kong or Singapore where there is a low tax regime, or registered offshore where tax can be mitigated further.\n\nTrust structures domiciled either overseas or in the region are especially beneficial if a child “intends to stay in, or even relocate to, the place where he or she is studying”, says Rita Ku, partner at Rita Ku & Ser, a Hong Kong-based law firm focusing on family law and wealth management. They can be set up “if the parent is wealthy enough . . . and they just want to set aside a certain big lump sum for the benefit of the child”, she says.\n\nFor example, in the case of families that do not already have a footprint in mainland China but want their next generations to study there, a trust set up in Hong Kong may be an efficient solution, Ku explains. Not only is the territory close to large cities such as Beijing, but there are also multiple tax benefits in Hong Kong that are not available in mainland China.\n\nEasier pathways to residency and citizenship in Hong Kong and Singapore have been an additional factor for many rich Chinese families, she says.\n\nCarol Wu, head of private bank for North Asia at DBS, suggests that rich families who are looking to pave the way for their children to emigrate to Asia could go further and consider setting up a family office in the region — on top of having offshore trust structures.\n\nMany are already doing so. Eric Landolt, global co-head of family advisory, art and collecting at UBS, says the Swiss bank has seen “more interest” from wealthy families outside Asia in setting up family offices in Hong Kong and Singapore. And, in some cases, the families are relocating and bringing their children to Asia with them.\n\nHowever, early planning is important if a wealthy family is looking to send its next generation to Asia for an education and a career after that, says Annie Koh, professor emeritus of finance (practice) Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University.\n\n“There are stages to getting residency — through graduating from a degree programme to . . . working in a company willing to sponsor your employment pass and eventually your residency,” she says. “Many current generations understand there is a process and the earlier that the children start the integration process, the better.”\n\n",

    "blurb": "A smarter and leaner public sector is essential amid tight budgets and rising demands",
    "date": "2023-10-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Travelling abroad can often spur bouts of “e-envy” — or jealousy over the digital ease of life elsewhere. Whether it is the ability to file a tax form in a click or to renew a passport via a smartphone, business leaders and tourists get an insight into how their government might drain less of their time back home. Immense pressures on the public sector, however, come not only from disgruntled citizens. With debts elevated and demands on public spending growing, governments across the world must work out how they can deliver more, with less.\n\nThe public sector already plays a prominent role in advanced economies. It employs around one in five workers while general government spending accounts for 40 per cent of gross domestic product on average. This gives it a significant bearing on national productivity. Ageing populations, climate change, and national security challenges are meanwhile bringing additional burdens on the state. Indeed, with tight budgets and rising debt interest payments, it is now even more essential that tax and spend decisions are not wasteful, and that governments find ways to become more productive.\n\nDefining what public sector productivity means is part of the challenge. It is often equated with cutting jobs or shifting resources from lower priority departments. But this comes at a cost — dilapidated infrastructure, longer healthcare waiting lists, and administrative blunders. Instead, governments need to work smarter, both in identifying and eliminating waste, and also by extracting more — and higher quality — from their existing resources. For measure, research by McKinsey estimates that operational improvements could save the US government $750bn per annum, without reducing the effectiveness of services.\n\nLeveraging technology — for instance by digitising paperwork, using data to generate policy insights, and automating tasks — offers most promise for boosting long-term efficiency and quality. Many nations have already made strides in e-governance, with Scandinavia leading the way, according to UN rankings. Estonia’s e-Tax system sends pre-filled tax forms to be checked and filed within minutes. In Singapore registering a company online can take just 15 minutes. Indeed, digital governance can streamline staffing needs, smooth compliance processes, and raise the productivity of the private sector — small businesses can lose a few working weeks per year grappling with regulation.\n\nThe reams of data collected by governments can also be cleaned and analysed to unearth inefficiencies, improve services, and even raise revenues, particularly with the aid of artificial intelligence. America’s Internal Revenue Service, for example, recently announced plans to use AI to collect unpaid taxes. In Britain’s NHS, the auto-generation of cumbersome patient forms could free up time for nurses and clinicians, while machine learning could also help hospitals to manage capacity better.\n\nDitching outdated technology — particularly fax machines, which are shockingly still used by some governments — for existing best practice is a no-brainer. Adopting newer gadgetry may have an upfront cost, but it can bring significant long-term efficiency gains. Broader operational improvements can also come through developing and attracting talent better, boosting partnerships with the private sector, and encouraging innovation and experimentation.\n\nRevamping vast bureaucratic machines while they are operating is not easy. Governments have to balance the more effective use of technology and data with privacy concerns, cyber security risks, and regulation. The skillsets to manage transformation can be lacking too. These challenges need to be overcome. The cost of not doing so means an ever-growing strain on public services, and ongoing pressure to raise taxes. In the meantime, envious travellers can at least help prod governments into action.",

    "body": "Private equity firms are facing the worst year in a decade for selling portfolio companies after higher interest rates and geopolitical tensions ended the buyout industry’s boom.\n\nIn the first nine months of the year, buyout firms generated $584bn from either selling companies outright or through taking them public, according to data from PitchBook.\n\nThe amount is more than $100bn shy of what the industry raised during the same period last year and almost two-thirds below the record $1.4tn generated in 2021, when borrowing costs were low and US equities still in a bull market.\n\nHigher interest rates have hammered the market for initial public offerings and made companies wary of making acquisitions. The last time buyout firms made less cashing in on their portfolio companies was in 2013, the data shows.\n\nThe figures underline the challenge confronting private equity firms as they try to monetise their investments and return money to investors, who include the world’s biggest pension and sovereign wealth funds. Singapore’s GIC, one of the most influential investors, warned in July that a golden age for the buyout industry had ended.\n\nOne industry executive said that buyout firms were still seeking “2021 prices” for portfolio companies, while potential acquirers and public investors wanted valuations that reflected higher interest rates, the weaker economic outlook and a largely moribund IPO market.\n\nFaced with much tougher hurdles in selling portfolio companies at prices they want, private equity firms are resorting to unconventional tactics to realise proceeds for their own investors.\n\nThey have been increasingly using margin loans and net asset value financing — secured against shares in their listed companies or their asset portfolios — to fund distributions to investors.\n\nPrivate equity groups were getting “more creative” in finding ways to generate cash for their investors given the tougher backdrop, said David Martin, a partner at law firm Linklaters.\n\nThe willingness to take on more debt has drawn scrutiny from the Institutional Limited Partners Association, an industry body representing private equity investors. The group is drafting recommendations that will call for buyout groups to justify the use of these loans and disclose how much they will cost, the Financial Times reported earlier this month.\n\nIn another sign of the strains facing the industry, EQT Group, one of Europe’s largest buyout firms, this week said it was making plans to hold private stock sales for its portfolio companies given the struggles of the IPO market.\n\nFirms are also increasingly using continuation funds, which involves a firm selling an asset from an older fund to one of its newer ones. Investors in the funds are typically offered the chance to cash out during these asset transfers.\n\nA recent survey of 200 UK-based private equity executives found that continuation funds were viewed as a better option for private equity firms looking to monetise their deals than an IPO or running an auction of an asset.",

It was “too early” to comment on the details, he said.\n\n“They are following the money. It makes sense to have a presence here [in Singapore],” one of the people said, who added that the plan was still subject to change. Wilson Sonsini, which has represented technology groups including Microsoft and Facebook, could relocate some employees from the greater China practice, the person added.\n\nSingapore, a neutral financial hub, has been a beneficiary of the capital shift away from China to other parts of Asia, especially south-east Asia. Several China-focused investors have recently expanded or opened offices in the city-state, including private equity firms Hillhouse, PAG and Boyu Capital and venture capital groups GGV and HongShan, formerly Sequoia Capital China. Both HongShan and Boyu have been Wilson Sonsini clients.\n\nOne of the oldest and respected technology law firms in Silicon Valley, Wilson Sonsini first established its China practice in 2007 with an office in Shanghai, betting early on the country’s fast-growing start-ups and advising US companies. It built out its Chinese practice with offices in Hong Kong and Beijing several years later.\n\nThe firm’s Singapore talks come as Washington’s technology battle with Beijing has made cross-border investments more difficult, with Chinese deal activity in the US falling to its lowest level in 17 years in 2023, according to data from Dealogic. The Biden administration in August said it would ban some US investment into China’s quantum computing, advanced chips and artificial intelligence sectors.\n\nInternational funding for Chinese start-ups has also dried up as a result of a slowdown in the mainland economy and an uncertain domestic regulatory outlook.\n\nWilson Sonsini has helped US companies to do mainland deals and has also assisted China-based clients, including internet giant Tencent, chipmaker SMIC and dronemaker DJI, to make investments and acquisitions. Some Chinese clients, such as Tencent, have also expanded in Singapore since the pandemic to support their international growth.\n\nThe Silicon Valley firm already has relationships with key Singapore investors. It represented GIC, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, on its investment in payments processing company Stripe in March. It advised state investment company Temasek on its deal to lead a major investment in cultivated meat start-up Upside Foods in April last year.",

The number of such offices registered in Singapore has increased nearly threefold from 2020 to 2022, to more than 1,000.\n\nBut the government cautioned against “knee-jerk” reactions to what is now one of the world’s biggest money laundering investigations, saying they could make the city-state a harder place to do business.\n\nThe government’s proposal to broaden anti-money laundering regulations comes as the total value of assets seized or frozen as part of the probe has nearly tripled since the scandal burst into the open in August, when 10 people were arrested in an operation spanning Singapore. Authorities also seized luxury cars, designer watches, handbags and expensive wine as well as cash and gold bars.\n\nForeign and local banks, as well as property agents, precious metals dealers and elite golf clubs, have been caught up in the case.\n\nSingapore has faced public pressure to crack down on illicit activity and questions about how the syndicate — which is believed to have laundered the proceeds of overseas criminal activities and forgery — was able to operate for so long despite the city-state’s strict financial regulations.\n\nThe suspects, all of whom had Chinese passports and have been tied to illegal gambling operations originating in the mainland, are alleged to have been operating in Singapore since 2017, and the case first attracted government scrutiny in 2021. Several individuals are still at large and wanted for questioning, according to the Singapore Police Force.\n\nAn interministerial committee, led by second minister for finance Indranee Rajah, will be formed to consider further measures to strengthen Singapore’s anti-money laundering regime, the government said on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to the possibility of extending due diligence controls to purchases of luxury goods, the government said it would examine tightening the immigration verification process. Singapore has absorbed rapid inflows of wealth and individuals, particularly from China, since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAny new measures would require careful moderation, said Josephine Teo, second minister for home affairs. Singapore has said its antitrust and money-laundering regulations comply with international standards.\n\n“We need rules . . . but let us be careful about knee-jerk reactions, which could make our business environment unfriendly,” Teo said.\n\nThe money laundering case has already had repercussions for the hub’s financial community. Wealth managers and other advisers have said that waiting periods to open private banking accounts for clients with foreign passports, including from China, have stretched into four months, up from less than one month previously, while some existing accounts were closed, as authorities tightened due diligence.\n\nThe government could also strengthen scrutiny of single family offices, many of which were set up by wealthy mainland Chinese and receive licensing exemptions because they do not manage third-party funds.\n\nOne or more of the accused may have benefited from incentives under the government’s family office scheme, according to minister of state Alvin Tan.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore was “reviewing [its] internal incentive administration processes”, Tan said.",

    "body": "Banks in Singapore are stepping up scrutiny of customers from a range of countries including China and intensifying efforts to identify the sources of wealth as the city-state reels from a ballooning S$2.4bn (US$1.8bn) money-laundering scandal.\n\nFinancial institutions have warned customers and their advisers that the waiting period to open a private banking account has increased from less than one month to three to four, according to wealth advisers, asset managers and private bankers. Some existing accounts are being closed, the people added.\n\nThe longer processing times are not an official rule change, the people said, but a reflection of authorities tightening due diligence across the financial sector after a transnational money laundering syndicate was exposed in August.\n\nThe institutions are focusing on customers from countries including China, Vanuatu, Turkey, St Kitts and Nevis, Dominica and Cyprus.\n\n“If you have a People’s Republic of China passport, or possess a passport from any of the countries the suspects involved in the probe had, such as Cyprus, Vanuatu or Cambodia, you are getting red-flagged,” said one adviser in private banking.\n\nSingapore police last month arrested and charged 10 people and have seized more than S$2.4bn in assets including luxury properties, gold bars, designer handbags, cash, crypto assets and cars in one of the city-state’s largest-ever money-laundering probes.\n\nThe suspects, who have been denied bail, all had Chinese passports. Many were also in possession of additional passports. The probe has widened to include banks, precious metals dealers, real estate agents and golf clubs.\n\nThe government has also faced scrutiny about the case and how such lapses happened despite strict anti-money laundering regulations.\n\nSingapore’s appeal as a stable and neutral wealth hub rose during the coronavirus pandemic, with asset managers attracting S$448bn in net new inflows of funds in 2021, up 16 per cent from the previous year. The number of family offices has jumped from a handful in 2018 to 1,100 at the end of 2022, according to the government.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore, the central bank, sent a note last month to all financial institutions, including asset managers, instructing them to scrutinise dealings with the suspects as well as individuals and companies linked to them, according to two banking executives who saw the notice.\n\nSeveral banks, including Malaysia’s CIMB and Citigroup’s local subsidiary, have already been asked to provide documents to the investigation. Police have also taken control of millions of dollars held in accounts with Credit Suisse and Bank Julius Baer by one of the suspects.\n\n“MAS takes this case seriously and supervisory engagements with these financial institutions are ongoing,” MAS said in a statement. “Given the attributes and size of their transactions, high net worth individuals are often subjected to more stringent checks by financial institutions.”\n\nThe central bank added that it “regularly reaches out” to regulated entities to mitigate risks but does not share those dealings as they are confidential.\n\n“Part of the reason onboarding new customers from certain places is taking longer is because banks are painstakingly going through their records to make sure they have no business with the people or entities on the MAS’s list,” said a director at one wealth manager.\n\n“We have also seen some closing accounts of individuals from some of those jurisdictions,” the person added.\n\nA managing director at another international firm whose clients include family offices from multiple Asian countries said they had been informed that processing times for new accounts could take months as know your customer and other anti-money laundering steps were tightened.\n\n“Most clients are actually fairly happy about this — it provides a sense of security . . . that Singapore is cracking down on any illicit activity,” the person said. “It is a sign of the maturation of Singapore as a financial hub.”",

    "body": "The Cayman Islands will open an office in Singapore by the end of the year, as the Caribbean offshore financial services centre seeks to capture more business from Asia’s hedge funds and wealthy families.\n\nAn office in Singapore would allow the Caribbean territory to “better capitalise on the many new business opportunities . . . that the Asian region has to offer”, said André Ebanks, Cayman Islands financial services minister, on Friday.\n\nThe city-state’s connectivity and “relatively neutral position in the region” made it the right choice for the country’s first Asian base, Ebanks added. The Cayman Islands had also considered Hong Kong, which he said remained an “important locale”.\n\nThe opening of the office also represented a pushback against Singapore and Hong Kong, which have stepped up efforts in recent years to compete with traditional tax havens to serve Asia’s growing population of wealthy investors.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region accounts for about 42 per cent of global wealth, or $218tn, according to a McKinsey report last year, up fourfold since 2000. In 2021, the wealth of households with investable assets of $100,000-$1mn in Asia totalled $2.7tn, according to the consultancy, a sum projected to climb to $4.7tn by 2026 as incomes continue to rise across the region.\n\nWith the move to Singapore, “the Caymans aren’t just rolling out the red carpet for Asia’s wealthy; they’re laying down a runway for private jets”, said Kher Sheng Lee, co-head of the Alternative Investment Management Association for Asia.\n\nSingapore and Hong Kong have launched fund structures in recent years to lure business from low-tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, Mauritius and the British Virgin Islands. The schemes allow investors to hold money in lightly taxed vehicles with generous government subsidies.\n\nSingapore, which has long prospered as a stable and predictable environment for business, has had more success than Hong Kong in attracting managers and wealthy family offices to establish funds.\n\nSingapore’s new “variable capital companies” have exploded in popularity since their introduction in 2020, with 937 set up as of August. The uptake of Hong Kong’s “open-ended fund companies” has been slower, with 112 registered with the city’s Securities and Futures Commission as of the end of last year, according to law firm Deacons. Hong Kong’s OFC regime was launched in 2018.\n\nThe vehicles are popular with family offices, hedge funds and other private equity firms managing money.\n\n“There has been very rapid growth in family offices in Singapore in the past few years and this is the Cayman Islands keeping themselves on their radar,” said Joel Seow, a private investment funds lawyer at Linklaters. “This is recognition that there is a growing and maturing market in Asia in terms of size, depth and sophistication . . . they want options.”\n\nThe number of family offices in Singapore has soared from just a handful in 2018 to well over 1,000.\n\n“Investors have compelling reasons to consider the Cayman Islands, given their tried-and-true fund structures. While Singapore’s VCCs and Hong Kong’s OFCs offer new avenues, the Caymans bring a legacy of reliability,” said Lee.\n\nHe said the new Caymans office would target a broad spectrum of opportunities in Asia, extending beyond finance to maritime and other strategic sectors.\n\nThe Cayman Islands’ push may also benefit from a crackdown in Singapore, where a series of arrests last month in a money laundering investigation has unnerved some Chinese nationals, according to two people familiar with the situation, including an adviser for a wealth management firm catering to Chinese family offices.\n\n“I have spoken to a number of PRC [People’s Republic of China] nationals staying here who are looking at shifting their money somewhere else because they are worried about asset seizures,” the adviser said.\n\nAdditional reporting by William Langley in Hong Kong\n\nThis article has been updated to correct the names of the Securities and Futures Commission and the Alternative Investment Management Association",

    "blurb": "The city-state has long prospered as a global hub but some question whether the model is still working",
    "date": "2023-09-1100:00:00.0",
    "body": "On a hot day in August, Singaporean police arrived at one of the city’s swankiest addresses, made their way past a miniature golf course in the courtyard, and charged inside. At homes across the city — always in the wealthiest neighbourhoods — similar scenes were repeating as police rounded up people suspected of belonging to a billion-dollar money-laundering ring.\n\nOnce upstairs, the officers banged on the bedroom door. When they entered, Su Haijin, a 40-year-old man of Chinese, Cambodian and Cypriot nationality, was gone. But not very far. On hearing the police, Su had hurled himself off the second-floor balcony, fracturing his hands and legs. Police found him hiding in a nearby drain.\n\nThe case, in which Su and nine others have been charged so far, has captivated a public wholly unused to seeing the insalubrious side of their country laid bare. It is not just the trappings of the S$1.8bn ($1.3bn) bust — gold bars, designer handbags, luxury cars, lavish property and digital fortunes — that have fascinated. Global banks, precious metal dealers, property agents and one of the country’s most famous golf clubs have also been sucked into the scandal.\n\nSingapore has for decades prospered in no small measure due to its reputation as the “Switzerland of the east” — a safe and neutral haven for business in an at-times intractable part of the world.\n\nThe investigation has captured global attention, “not just due to its size and links to Chinese money”, says Chong Ja Ian, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, “but also because it underscores the risks as Singapore tries to reshape itself in a more competitive and fragmented world”.\n\nSingapore, he adds, wants to be “a premium place for premium business, not just a Cayman Islands or a Mauritius, a place where global capital can come in and be reinvested elsewhere. But a raid of this scale shows the model has serious drawbacks.”\n\nWhile Singapore’s open, trade-reliant economy has proved resilient to external shocks such as rising global protectionism and supply chain fragmentation, the raid comes at a sensitive and destabilising time.\n\nThe city-state is wrestling with rising inequality — linked to unrestrained capital inflows from the US, Europe and especially China — as it prepares for its first change of leader in almost 20 years. Some are questioning whether an economic model so reliant on foreign capital is benefiting citizens in the way it once did.\n\nThere is also the delicate matter of deteriorating Sino-US relations. As more mainland Chinese cash and influence seeps out of China and into Singapore, the country’s high-wire balancing act between Beijing and Washington becomes even more precarious. All 10 accused in the money-laundering sting share one thing in common: possession of a passport believed to be issued in China.\n\nThe test for Singapore’s ruling People’s Action party, analysts say, will be its ability to keep citizens convinced of the merits of remaining pro-globalisation and welcoming of foreign capital. Navigating the US-China split will depend on it.\n\n“All foreign policy is domestic policy,” says Donald Low, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a former civil servant in Singapore. “What will shape how Singapore manages its international agenda is how they can manage these domestic tensions.”\n\nUnder the iron leadership of Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore who died in 2015, the city-state was propelled after independence from Malaysia in 1965 from a south-east Asian backwater into one of the world’s most successful economies.\n\nLee understood that encouraging foreign investment, the immigration of skilled workers and swift adoption of new technology was part of nation-building. At a time when many countries were suspicious of global multinational corporations, Lee welcomed them with low taxes and subsidies, marrying capitalism with a welfare state that protected citizens and provided housing, medical care and education.\n\nSingapore benefited from a period of rapid industrialisation and globalisation worldwide, its strategic location making it an ideal hub for trade and commerce. In 1965, per capita gross domestic product was a mere $516 compared with $91,000 today — higher than the US, Australia, France and the UK, and not far behind Switzerland.\n\nThe economic boom continued under Lee’s successors, first Goh Chok Tong and then Lee’s son, Lee Hsien Loong, who came to power in 2004.\n\nEven the US-China decoupling and other global shocks, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have not derailed its progress. Stable Singapore has even benefited from the external disorder.\n\n“There is a paradox that smaller open economies benefit from worsening bilateral relations,” says David Bach, a professor at the International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland. “As a result of recent dynamics Singapore has become a lot safer for investors and multinationals to conduct business.”\n\nSingapore’s “safe hub” reputation — coupled with its low taxes — has helped the city-state to compete with the massive industry subsidies on offer across large developed economies in the US and Europe, such as the US’s Inflation Reduction Act or the EU’s Green Deal.\n\nSingapore receives a bigger percentage of US foreign direct investment into Asia-Pacific than China and Hong Kong combined. Overall foreign direct investment inflows surged to S$195bn last year, its highest level ever and a 10 per cent increase from S$176bn in 2021. Singapore attracted a record S$22.5bn in fixed asset investments in 2022 despite the global headwinds.\n\nMany think the money-laundering scandal will have little long-lasting impact on Singapore’s reputation overseas.\n\n“The money is pouring in,” says Parag Khanna, founder and managing partner of FutureMap, a global strategic advisory firm. Investors want somewhere “genuinely open, home to everyone and that isn’t dominated by one power. Hong Kong has long since ceased to be that pan-Asian hub.”\n\nAmong the multinationals that call Singapore home is German conglomerate Siemens. Roland Busch, chief executive, said in June that the company chose Singapore over places with cheaper labour and property costs such as India and Indonesia to build a new high-tech factory. Globally connected Singapore, Busch said, was a “lighthouse of stability”.\n\nEven with slowing global growth and weak local demand, Singapore has avoided a recession. Core inflation slowed for a third straight month in July to a year-on-year rate of 3.8 per cent. Unemployment was 1.9 per cent in the second quarter of this year. By comparison, in the same quarter Hong Kong recorded a rate of 2.9 per cent, London was at 5.1 per cent and, in June, New York’s rate was 5.4 per cent.\n\nYet while it thrives as a global power, Singapore has domestic concerns. The long-ruling People’s Action party is grappling with only its third change in leadership since independence, with finance minister and deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong — the so-called 4G or fourth generation leader — likely to take the reins.\n\nWong will take over at a time when the PAP’s share of the popular vote is at historic lows. The timing of the handover remains unknown and whether Lee or Wong will lead the PAP through the next general election — due to be held by November 23, 2025 — is unclear. While the PAP’s grasp on power in the quasi-authoritarian democracy remains firm, the opposition Workers’ party won a record 10 out of 93 contested seats in the 2020 general election for Singapore’s parliament.\n\nFor Singaporeans preparing for this next era, the opacity of the succession plan adds to an underlying sense of unease about the city-state’s identity. “Philosophically and emotionally, it’s the sense that the ‘Switzerland of the east’ is actually designed more for global plutocrats than ordinary Singaporeans,” says Sudhir Vadaketh, editor of Jom, a Singaporean weekly magazine.\n\nSome see Singapore as a way station, others a nation home, others a bit of both, Vadaketh adds. “There’s an inherent existential tension between the two that expresses itself in different ways, and requires perpetual management from politicians and bureaucrats. [August’s] money-laundering case, for many people, reminds us that we may be leaning too much towards ‘global city’.”\n\nSingapore, whose own population is ageing, has become a favoured home for Asia’s millionaires, prompting local pushback to foreign workers and immigration. House prices and rents have skyrocketed, with the median price of a private home hitting $1.2mn in 2022, the highest among cities in the Asia-Pacific, according to data from the Urban Land Institute Asia Pacific Centre for Housing. Rents for private homes outpaced even New York City at the end of last year.\n\nMany Singaporeans are somewhat shielded thanks to a government housing scheme. Close to 80 per cent live in state flats and the majority own their home via long-term leases from the government. But even here higher costs are trickling through.\n\n“I am moving back in with my parents because the landlord at the Housing Development Board flat I was renting with a friend lifted the rent from $3,000 per month to $5,000. That is crazy for a two-bedroom apartment,” says Nicole, a Singaporean living in Tiong Bahru who did not want to give her full name.\n\nFuelling a large part of this spike in housing costs, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, has been the movement of rich Chinese, not just tycoons but also talented citizens with specific skills. Many are fleeing a “common prosperity” campaign — aimed at redistributing more of China’s wealth — and a crackdown on multiple industries including property, healthcare, technology and education.\n\n“Singapore-washing”, where mainland Chinese companies redomicile and rebrand as Singapore-based international businesses as a hedge against geopolitical risk, has increased. Of 63,801 new corporate entities formed in Singapore last year, 29 per cent had majority foreign ownership, according to analytics group Handshakes. Of those 7,312 were from China, up from 4,951 in 2021. Even HongShan, formerly known as Sequoia China, a mainland investment juggernaut which has long focused its financial firepower on Chinese technology start-ups, opened a Singapore office this year.\n\n“It used to be they all fled to Hong Kong but now Singapore has unintentionally become a favoured destination for rich Chinese but also Chinese professionals,” says Low, the former civil servant. “Of course there is a reaction to that [in Singapore]. They raise prices all around and fuel the politics of envy.”\n\nThe city-state drew in more money than ever before in 2021, with S$448bn in new funds, according to the most recent data available from its central bank, a number expected to be even higher for 2022.\n\nBut the S$1.8bn money-laundering scandal will reinforce some critics’ view that Singapore acts as a bolt-hole for less-than-respectable money or flight capital. Since the pandemic, Singapore has seen an explosion of activity in its decentralised financial market: family offices, private banking and new discreet, lightly taxed funds. These are harder to regulate and to justify as benefiting the mainstream Singaporean economy, for instance there has not been a parallel jump in stock market listings.\n\n“I think the money-laundering probe barely scratches the surface of the illicit activity that has gone on here for years,” says the Singaporean head of a large international investment bank in the city, referring to wealthy Indonesians and other rich south-east Asian individuals who have used the city-state to keep their wealth. “It is something the government must manage better or risk the rise of populism and xenophobia that has swept through so many other countries.”\n\nThe flow of money into Singapore is not only from China, nor is it the only country affected by the way elite Chinese people are shifting money overseas. But it does provide a colourful, timely example of how Singapore’s neutrality could eventually be affected.\n\nKenneth Jeyaretnam, the secretary-general of the opposition Reform party, on his Facebook page noted the money-laundering raids took place days after a visit by China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, and suggested there was “foreign pressure”.\n\nThe PAP has rejected this assertion and issued Jeyaretnam with a correction order under its online falsehoods or so-called fake news law. The financial regulator said that suspicious fund flows and other inconsistencies with documentation prompted banks in the city state to file reports to the authorities.\n\nOne Washington-based policymaker tells the Financial Times that the Biden administration is “watching more closely than ever before” the Chinese companies and people moving to Singapore. “The more the volumes of money and people that come in, the more Beijing might start to feel it can intervene in Singaporean affairs,” they say.\n\nThe Chinese Communist party is often accused of using its soft power machine to influence Singaporeans — the majority of whom are ethnic Chinese — and the mainland Chinese who have emigrated there.\n\nA recent Washington Post report suggested Beijing was using the Singaporean Chinese Lianhe Zaobao newspaper to sway opinions in the city-state. When asked about the report, Singapore’s ambassador-at-large Chan Heng Chee in August said the government was “well aware of these activities” and was “vigilant against agents of influence of all countries”.\n\nThe Singapore newspaper said in a statement that the Washington Post’s article “made biased comments and unfair statements about Lianhe Zaobao”. The media organisation added it “takes its mission of delivering information seriously and remains committed to neutrality”.\n\nThe PAP formally upgraded its relationship with Beijing this year in areas including technology as well as supply chains. The two launched a new bilateral defence hotline in June and restarted military drills after a pandemic-related pause. Singapore has at the same time maintained its close relations with the US military.\n\nBut the party admits Singapore’s position is tricky. Wong, the prime minister-in-waiting, this year said the rift between Beijing and Washington “appears insurmountable”.\n\nSingapore has “one foot firmly in each canoe, gaining benefits from both [the US and China],” says Drew Thomson, a visiting senior research fellow at National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. “But those canoes are drifting apart, can you really play both sides forever?”\n\nData visualisation by Andy Lin and Keith Fray",

    "body": "Singapore authorities have requested documents from at least 10 banks as they extend a S$1bn (US$737mn) money laundering investigation.\n\nPublic prosecutors told a court on Wednesday that they were seeking documents from financial institutions used by 10 people who were arrested last week and charged in one of the city-state’s biggest-ever money laundering and fraud cases.\n\nProsecutors asked the court to extend the remand for those arrested for a further eight days.\n\nThe suspects were detained in an operation that spanned the city-state and led to the seizure of luxury homes, cars, designer handbags and wads of cash and gold bars.\n\nThe names of two banks — Citigroup’s Singapore subsidiary and Malaysia’s CIMB — emerged when charges against those arrested were published last week. Other banks have not been named and none of the financial institutions have been charged.\n\nCitigroup said in a statement it was “committed to the fight against money laundering and ensuring the highest standard of governance controls”. CIMB did not respond to a request for comment. Singapore police declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe investigation of the alleged money laundering ring, which authorities said was still at an early stage, has cast uncomfortable scrutiny on the Asian business hub’s embrace of foreign wealth and put pressure on Singapore’s clean reputation.\n\nThe 10 individuals, who were detained in simultaneous raids involving 400 officers, are suspected of laundering the proceeds of overseas criminal activities, including scams and online gambling, as well as forging documents.\n\nAuthorities descended on apartments and mansions and seized assets including wine, jewellery and Bentley and Rolls-Royce cars that were collectively valued at S$1bn.\n\nThe group, which included nationals from China, Cyprus, Turkey and Vanuatu, were all in possession of China-issued passports, according to police.\n\nSingapore’s political opposition has seized on the probe to accuse the government of being too open to foreign money and overseas entities.\n\n“If we provide a warm welcome to very dirty businesses . . . then we can’t expect to escape without a stain on our ‘squeaky clean’ reputation,” said Kenneth Jeyaretnam, secretary-general of the opposition Reform party.\n\nHe added that money laundering activity “pushes up asset prices and makes property unaffordable for Singaporeans”, and accused the ruling People’s Action party government of undertaking the probe only foreign pressure, noting that the raid followed a visit by China’s foreign minister Wang Yi days earlier.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore said that suspicious fund flows and other inconsistencies with documentation had prompted banks to alert authorities, which led to the investigation.\n\n“MAS takes this case seriously and has been in touch with the financial institutions where the potentially tainted funds have been identified. Supervisory engagements with these financial institutions are ongoing,” the authority said in a statement last week.\n\nSingapore has welcomed a rapid influx of money and wealthy individuals from China, many of them fleeing President Xi Jinping’s strict coronavirus regime and crackdown on multiple sectors of the economy including real estate and technology.",

    "body": "Singapore has long prided itself on its government’s stability and predictability. But that reputation has been shaken by a series of recent scandals that have put the ruling party on the back foot.\n\nA senior minister has been ensnared in a corruption probe alongside a billionaire property tycoon. The speaker of the house was caught swearing on a hot mic, an incident that undermined his impartiality — and was closely followed by the public disclosure of his extramarital affair with another ruling party lawmaker, leading both to resign.\n\nTwo other MPs were questioned in parliament after online criticism prompted a corruption investigation into their renting of state-owned mansions. Both were exonerated.\n\nBy the standards of most democracies, these might seem minor breaches that would not jeopardise public confidence in the government. But in Singapore, where the government has justified its decades-long rule — and tight social controls — by maintaining an image of competence and reliability, they represented a threatening rupture for the city-state of five million people.\n\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last week stepped in to reassure citizens that his People’s Action party, which was founded by his father Lee Kuan Yew and has governed uninterrupted since before Singapore became a republic in 1965, was as strong and reliable as ever.\n\nVisibly frustrated with criticism of the country’s anti-graft body, which reports to the prime minister, Lee declared the organisation “has to answer to somebody. It cannot answer to God.”\n\nWhile Lee promised to “protect the integrity” of the government in a National Day address on Wednesday, last month’s events underscored the perceived opacity in the decision-making of the long-ruling party, just as it is preparing for its first leadership change in nearly two decades.\n\n“There are a lot of conspiracy theories because nobody can really tell what is going on within the PAP and with the internal workings or decision-making,” said Chong Ja Ian, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. “The accumulation of these events does create a sense of bewilderment and unease on the direction of travel and as Singapore faces new leadership in a more contentious world.”\n\nFor critics, the turmoil last month also called into question the PAP’s ability to effectively manage domestic politics at a crucial juncture for the city-state. Singapore is juggling growing challenges at home including a backlash against foreign workers, rising costs and inequality, tensions between the US and China and a shift away from the globalising forces that boosted its open, trade-reliant economy and made it a global financial centre.\n\nOne of the main issues undercutting public confidence has been the lack of visibility of the next generation of leadership, critics said. The PAP last year picked Lawrence Wong to succeed Lee, who has led Singapore since 2004.\n\nCritics say the 4G leaders, so called because Wong would be only the fourth prime minister in Singapore’s history, have not offered a vision for the city-state’s future at a time when the drivers of its past growth are expected to face mounting headwinds. The timing of Lee’s handover also remains unclear.\n\n“Where are the 4G leaders? By rights, Wong should be prime minister by now but I think Lee will now hold on until the next election,” which must be held by 2025, said Michael Barr, associate professor of international relations at Flinders University in Adelaide and author of The Ruling Elite of Singapore.\n\nLee postponed a plan to step aside before he turned 70 in 2022 so he could hand over Singapore “intact” after the pandemic. In the 2020 election, the PAP earned one of the lowest shares of the popular vote in the country’s history.\n\nAdding to the intrigue around inner party workings, many regard the PAP as becoming more, not less, sensitive to criticism. Politicians have wielded the country’s fake news law to silence online criticism, experts said.\n\nIn July, authorities invoked the Protection Against Online Falsehoods Act against the prime minister’s estranged younger brother Lee Hsien Yang, who resides overseas, over a Facebook post criticising the government’s handling of the spate of recent scandals.\n\n“This does not help the PAP in navigating a complex and turbulent global environment. The last thing Singapore needs are these sorts of issues which erode trust in government and fuel the impression that the rich and powerful look after themselves,” said Donald Low, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a former civil servant in Singapore.\n\n“When people can’t criticise, they channel that unhappiness and resentment into the kind of areas that have driven Brexit and the rise of Trump,” he added.\n\nThe events have raised the stakes for the presidential elections in September. The role is largely ceremonial, but experts said the poll would provide a gauge of public sentiment. While the PAP’s grasp on power in the quasi-authoritarian democracy remains firm, the opposition Workers’ party won a record 10 out of 93 contested seats in the 2020 general election for Singapore’s parliament.\n\n“None of these scandals, even in aggregate, are a body blow for the party,” said one Singapore official with knowledge of PAP thinking. “But I would say September is definitely being closely watched as a dry run for the general election” in 2025.\n\nThe PAP has put forward one of its most prominent figures, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, a statesman and former deputy leader whose popularity outstrips that of Lee.\n\n“The PAP will not want to obviously draw a link between the scandals and the election,” said Flinders University’s Barr, suggesting that “anything less than 65 per cent of the vote” would be a disappointment given Tharman’s qualifications and popularity.\n\n“They will pay a lot of attention to the results.”\n\n​Letter in response to this article:\n\nTransparency is ‘hallmark’ of Singapore’s government / From TK Lim, Singapore High Commissioner, London SW1, UK",

    "body": "Singapore’s prime minister has defended its reputation for clean governance after a corruption investigation and an “inappropriate” parliamentary relationship tarnished the city-state’s image just as it prepares for a leadership transition.\n\nLee Hsien Loong addressed Singapore’s episodes of rare political drama in parliament on Wednesday after they made international headlines.\n\nIn the most serious case, transport minister S Iswaran was arrested last month as part of a high-profile corruption investigation that also ensnared billionaire Ong Beng Seng. Both men, who were important figures in Singapore’s successful pitch to be part of the Formula One circuit, have been released on bail.\n\nNeither Ong nor Iswaran have commented publicly on their arrests. Hotel Properties Limited, of which Ong is managing director, said in July he had not been charged with any offence and was providing information to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau about his dealings with the minister.\n\nIn another high-profile case, the Speaker of Singapore’s parliament and a fellow member of the ruling People’s Action party quit as lawmakers last month after revelations that they had an affair.\n\n“With the investigation into minister Iswaran and the resignations of the house Speaker and an MP, the PAP has taken a hit,” Lee said.\n\nAsked about the independence of the anti-corruption bureau, which sought the prime minister’s permission before launching its probe into Iswaran, Lee said the body had to report to somebody. “It can’t report to God,” he said.\n\nThe prime minister separately in May asked the bureau to conduct a review after questions were asked in parliament and on social media about the government’s renting of colonial-era homes to two of his cabinet ministers.\n\nFor Singapore, which has traded on its reputation as a clean, stable place to do business throughout its rise to becoming a global finance centre, the episodes are unusually public examples of alleged corruption and unsavoury behaviour within the PAP. The ruling party has governed uninterrupted since independence in 1965 and Singapore’s politicians are among the most highly paid in the world to discourage graft.\n\nThe scandals also come as Lee, son of the founder of modern Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, prepares to hand over power to his deputy Lawrence Wong in what will be only the fourth change of leadership in its history.\n\nLee, who has not said when he will step down, defended the integrity of Singapore’s governance.\n\n“The way we have handled these incidents shows how seriously the PAP takes our responsibility of governing Singapore, and being accountable to parliament and to Singaporeans.”\n\nHe added that he had asked Iswaran to take a leave of absence and cut the minister’s pay, insisting that corruption cases had occurred in the past and had been dealt with thoroughly and transparently.\n\n“That is still how the PAP government deals with such cases. It has not changed under my charge; and it won’t under my successor either,” the prime minister said.\n\nBut Lee, who said he first knew of what he has called the “inappropriate” affair between parliamentary Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin and MP Cheng Li Hui in 2020, admitted he should have asked them to step down earlier.\n\nTan was asked to resign over the affair after a recording in which he referred in parliament to an opposition politician as a “fucking populist” circulated online. The Speaker’s role is meant to be impartial.\n\n“I should have forced the issue sooner,” Lee said of the affair, saying the Speaker’s role meant it raised questions of propriety, but that he had been concerned about the families of the two MPs.\n\nOpposition leader Pritam Singh of the Workers’ party said in response that the PAP had been less than upfront with “potentially embarrassing issues” and suggested it hire an ethics adviser.\n\nSingapore will next month hold an election for the largely ceremonial role of president, a vote that is being closely watched as a dry run for the general election that must be called by 2025.\n\n“I think the PAP is definitely watching public reactions and sentiment around the presidential race,” said one Singapore-based public policy expert, who asked to remain anonymous. “But are these scandals going to somehow sink the party at the next election? I really doubt it.”",

    "blurb": "Sovereign fund says high valuations, lower leverage costs and low interest rates are ‘not coming back any time soon’",
    "date": "2023-07-2500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s GIC, one of the world’s largest institutional investors, has warned that the golden age for private equity firms has “come to an end”.\n\nThe sovereign wealth fund, which has estimated assets of more than $700bn and is one of the largest backers of buyout funds, said a new era of higher interest rates and volatility had created challenges.\n\n“Many of the things that were tailwinds for the private equity industry have come to an end . . . and I don’t think they are coming back any time soon,” said chief investment officer Jeffrey Jaensubhakij, citing the lucrative mix of high valuations, lower leverage costs and low interest rates of the past few years.\n\n“Today, unfortunately, there’s both a supply and demand problem,” he added, referring to the number of assets available at a reasonable price and the number of investors wanting to put money into the asset class.\n\nSpeaking ahead of its annual results on Wednesday, GIC told the Financial Times that opportunities were available in the private market and it was allocating money towards logistics, infrastructure and other inflation-insulated assets.\n\nWednesday’s annual report showed GIC delivered an average annual return above inflation over the past 20 years — its main performance metric — of 4.6 per cent for 2023, up from 4.2 per cent a year earlier and is its highest level since 2015.\n\nChaired by Singapore’s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, GIC does not publish its assets under management but has increased its allocation to private equity to 17 per cent of its portfolio from 9 per cent in 2017, becoming a global investment force in everything from start-ups to toll roads.\n\nMarket volatility, higher interest rates and falling valuations have left the private equity industry struggling to raise money this year. Fundraising across private markets is on track this year to fall almost 30 per cent compared with 2022, according to a report released this month by Bain & Co.\n\nGIC said it could increase its private market exposure over the year ahead should the right investments emerge. “The private market does play to the advantage of a long-term investor like ourselves,” said chief executive Lim Chow Kiat. “If the market offers more opportunities, certainly we will direct our capital accordingly.”\n\nGIC said the fundraising drought in private markets was an area of opportunity. Many global private equity firms are facing pressure from their investors — who cannot allocate to new funds until they get some cash back — to sell parts of their portfolio “at reasonable prices”, Jaensubhakij said.\n\nSome investors have also “overcommitted” to private markets and are trying to offload stakes with up to 20 per cent discounts, he added. “We’ve had a couple of transactions recently of a reasonably large size.”\n\nGIC said the overall outlook over the next 12 months continued to be challenging, with global interest rates remaining elevated, the chances of a recession relatively high, and “chronic geopolitical risks”.\n\nOver the past year the Singapore state fund’s allocation to the US and Europe increased 1 percentage point each to 38 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, while decreasing to 23 per cent from 25 per cent in Asia excluding Japan. GIC has also pulled back on its investments in China in recent years as the mainland economy ground to a halt during the pandemic and was hit by property market turmoil and regulatory crackdowns.\n\nGIC said China’s economy was unlikely to receive the level of stimulus seen in previous downturns. “Even post-Covid deal flow has been extremely low. We would expect to participate when it normalises . . . we have to wait,” said Lim.\n\nThe state fund said it saw opportunities in other parts of Asia as multinational companies diversified their supply chains to cut their reliance on China. “India is a great example where we think more modern logistics will have to be built,” said Jaensubhakij, adding that “south-east Asia should also be a beneficiary of some of these supply-chain moves”.\n\nThis article has been republished to correct the Singapore state fund’s allocation to the US and Europe",

    "blurb": "The rivalry between the two cities has been sharpened by the US singer’s international tour plans",
    "date": "2023-07-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Two topics prompt impassioned discussion over inflation at expat dinner parties in Singapore at the moment: how much your rent has increased and Taylor Swift.\n\nThe first is met with a round of commiseration or begrudging congratulations, depending on whether you are closer to 100 per cent (most people) or a mere 20 per cent (a lucky few). The second sets off fierce debate on a favourite subject: the merits of Singapore versus Hong Kong.\n\nSwift, like Harry Styles and Coldplay, is performing in Singapore but skipping Hong Kong for next year’s international tour. The American pop star — who performed in the Chinese special administrative region on a 2011 tour — is holding six concerts in Singapore, a city-state of over 5mn people. This is more than for Sydney, Tokyo or Mexico City.\n\nThe reasons for Hong Kong’s snub are unclear. Social media is blaming everything from the national security law to the lack of suitable venues. Whatever the reason, these musical choices and rising rents are both indicative of the diverging fortunes of the two cities — at least in the short term.\n\nHong Kong and Singapore have for years competed for leading financial hub status. But strict pandemic lockdowns, draconian national security legalisation and worsening US-China relations have dulled Hong Kong’s appeal, while Singapore’s low taxes, stable rule of law, and neutrality has made it more enticing for businesses and tourists. Singapore’s total employment numbers now outstrip those in Hong Kong, despite the latter’s larger population.\n\nBut Singapore is dealing with the flip side of that boon: spiralling costs and a limited ability to manage them. “If two Beyoncé concerts apparently caused high inflation in Sweden, what will six Taylor Swift concerts do to Singapore?” grumbled one investment banker based in the city-state to me this week. He has two daughters desperate for VIP tickets.\n\nEven before tickets went on sale, prices for hotels and flights to Singapore were already soaring for March 2 to March 9 2024, when Swift is due to perform. Some three- and four-star hotels are 20 per cent more expensive compared with the week before, while flights from other cities in south-east Asia to Singapore are almost triple the normal price range.\n\nFacing demands for ad hoc school holidays while Swift is in town, Singapore’s education minister, Chan Chun Sing, said on Facebook that granting time off “may further fuel inflation”.\n\nWhile Hong Kong outpaced Singapore on inflation for most of the 1980s and 1990s, the roles have been reversed. Over the past two years, Singapore’s inflation has been consistently higher than that of its rival. An influx of new residents coupled with delays on new building during the pandemic have pushed rents to record levels. Singapore usurped New York as the city with the highest rental growth at the end of last year, according to Knight Frank, a real estate group.\n\nTiny Singapore can’t compete with other parts of south-east Asia for natural tourist attractions such as beaches or mountains, so it relies heavily on its appeal as a gastronomic hub. But even its lively restaurant scene is grappling with high commercial property rents that are defying a slowdown in other capitals. The manager of my favourite local Italian restaurant is moving to a different, more distant neighbourhood after the landlord doubled his rent.\n\nWhatever the downsides for residents, the healthy rivalry with Hong Kong is a good thing. Competition keeps both cities innovating, launching new financial products and tax incentives to lure business and capital. Hong Kong, determined to recover some of what it has lost, is already attempting to coax back companies, professionals and family offices.\n\nSome friends who moved over from Hong Kong during the pandemic are moving back, though Taylor Swift may make them regret that decision. One, a lawyer with two kids, said she made the decision after her rent was raised by 120 per cent. But she left last week with one request: “I might need a place to stay if I get Taylor Swift tickets. The hotels are too expensive.”\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com",

    "body": "Singapore’s corruption watchdog said it had arrested one of the city-state’s most high-profile property tycoons, expanding a rare operation that has embroiled a minister and dented its reputation as a clean place to do business.\n\nThe Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau confirmed on Friday that both hotelier Ong Beng Seng and transport minister S Iswaran had been arrested on Wednesday before being released on bail. Both had their passports impounded as a condition of their release, though the CPIB has allowed Ong to travel overseas and surrender his passport on his return.\n\nHotel Properties Limited, of which Ong is managing director, earlier said he was providing information to the CPIB about his interactions with Iswaran. No charges had been filed against Ong, whose bail was set at S$100,000 ($75,500), the company added.\n\nThe CPIB on Wednesday said Iswaran was assisting its investigation into a case, without giving further details. The probe is Singapore’s most serious involving a cabinet minister in more than three decades.\n\nSingapore’s officials are some of the best paid in the world and the government touts its reputation for a zero-tolerance approach to graft. The country is ranked the fifth-least corrupt country in Transparency International’s latest Corruption Perception index.\n\n“The ruling PAP [People’s Action party], which has governed Singapore since 1959 have always prided themselves on good governance and incorruptibility, among other virtues,” said Eugene Tan, associate professor of law and political commentator at Singapore Management University.\n\n“Domestically [the probe] has certainly got many tongues wagging.”\n\nOng, who founded Hotel Properties in 1980, is known for his role in helping to strike a deal with Formula One mogul Bernie Ecclestone to bring a grand prix to the country in 2007. The tycoon and his wife Christina’s net worth was valued at $1.75bn last year, according to Forbes.\n\nShares in Hotel Properties, which has interests in hotels and properties in 15 countries under brands including the Four Seasons and Intercontinental, shed as much as 7 per cent on Friday morning, hitting their lowest level in about a month before closing 2.6 per cent lower.\n\nSingaporean prime minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Wednesday that he had asked transport minister Iswaran to take a leave of absence until the investigation was concluded. Lawrence Wong, deputy prime minister, added on Thursday that Singapore had “always upheld a clean and incorrupt system of government”.\n\nThe investigation comes ahead of an expected handover of power between Lee and Wong and elections that must be held no later than November 2025.\n\nAn email sent to Iswaran’s government account returned with a message that he was on leave. The transport ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHotel Properties said Ong was “co-operating fully with CPIB and has provided the information requested”. It added that the company’s nominating committee had assessed that Ong could continue in his role as managing director while the investigation was under way, but would “continue to reassess [his] suitability”.\n\nA spokesperson for Ong declined to provide further information.",

    "date": "2023-07-1100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singaporean state-owned investor Temasek Holdings has reported its worst returns since 2016 and warned it has slowed investment amid recession risks, higher interest rates and geopolitical tensions.\n\nTemasek, one of the biggest and most active investors globally, said the net value of its portfolio had shrunk to S$382bn (US$285bn) in the financial year to March, as public and private equity capital markets fell and the technology sector was hit particularly hard. That compared with it being worth a record S$403bn in 2022. A S$7bn loss was driven by mark-to-market accounting.\n\nThe Asian investor, which has two-thirds of its portfolio in the region and has backed some of the world’s biggest start-ups from Jack Ma’s Ant Group in China to San Francisco and Dublin-based payments processing group Stripe, reported a 5.07 per cent drop in total shareholder returns. This compared with a 5.8 per cent increase the previous year and was far below the 24.5 per cent increase in 2021. The group slowed its investment pace for the period, calling it “the most challenging year for markets over the last decade”.\n\nThe results underline the struggle of global investors to adapt to a new era of higher interest rates. Temasek’s cost of capital rose from 7 per cent to 9 per cent. Its total returns over a 10-year and 20-year period were 6 per cent and 9 per cent respectively.\n\nThe drop in returns was the poorest annual performance since 2016. Investment returns from Temasek and sovereign wealth fund GIC, as well as the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the central bank, are the biggest contributors to Singapore’s budget.\n\n“The global economy is still quite fragile. Geopolitical tensions are high, showing no signs of easing. Inflation is elevated in most developed markets . . . we do believe that to get inflation under control, we probably will need to see a recession,” said chief investment officer Rohit Sipahimalani.\n\nTemasek, whose unlisted holdings have grown substantially over the past decade to more than 50 per cent of its portfolio, had some high-profile setbacks over the year. It was forced to write down its $275mn investment in the collapsed crypto exchange FTX. Chief executive Dilhan Pillay acknowledged the high reputational damage the investment had caused but described it as an “aberration”.\n\nSipahimalani said Temasek was moderating the pace of its investments and applying a “geopolitical lens” to its deals. “We won’t invest in areas that are in the crosshairs of US-China tensions. We’ll prefer to invest in companies that have access to large domestic markets.”\n\nManagement said it still saw opportunities in China over the long term in sectors linked to domestic consumption and electric vehicles, but its growth outlook was uncertain. “We expect that [government] stimulus will be much lower and much more modest than what we’ve historically seen,” Sipahimalani said.\n\nThe proportion of Temasek’s portfolio allocated to China has remained flat over the past decade. It made up 23 per cent of the portfolio in 2013 compared to 22 per cent in 2023, whereas the Americas has gone from 10 per cent to 21 per cent. Its largest exposure, at 28 per cent, is to Singapore.\n\nTemasek said it would look to boost investments in India and south-east Asia. It sees opportunities there owing to supply chain diversification away from China — dubbed China+1 — and the digital economy.",

    "body": "Sequoia Capital’s China unit is drawing up plans to expand into Singapore, putting it in competition with another arm of the venture capital group as the firm divides into three amid rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nHongShan, the Chinese arm of the Silicon Valley group, has set up an office in the city-state and is working on plans to use it as a base for investing in south-east Asia, multiple people with knowledge of the situation said.\n\nThat would pit the Chinese investment juggernaut, which manages $56bn in assets, against Peak XV Partners, Sequoia’s India and south-east Asia business, which already has an office in Singapore.\n\nBoth units, along with Sequoia’s US-based business, will split into separate companies by 2024, the group said last month.\n\nHongShan is “meeting lots of private capital investors and talking about doing deals and other opportunities here”, said a director at a rival venture capital fund in Singapore. “[They] have asked to keep [it] quiet for now . . . There are sensitivities involved with Peak XV.”\n\nSequoia denied last month that concerns about the rising tensions between the US and China were behind the firm’s uncoupling. It said its shared brand was creating “growing market confusion” and “portfolio conflicts”. The split means the US, China and India units will no longer use joint branding and back-office services and will stop sharing profits.\n\nWhile they are not barred from competing after the break-up, HongShan’s under-the-radar expansion in Singapore is an early sign of how the former colleagues are now entering each other’s turf as rivals. Peak XV is also planning to open a US office, the company said.\n\nA number of executives from HongShan have travelled to Singapore in the past six months, the rival fund director added. The new office will accommodate at least two members of its investment team.\n\nThe China unit, which is managed by renowned investor Neil Shen, who led early investments in Alibaba and TikTok owner ByteDance, has told people in Singapore meetings that it would initially look to support its existing Chinese founders who had international businesses in the city-state. However, it also expressed interest in investing in start-ups.\n\nOne person who had spoken to HongShan executives in Singapore said it could tap into growing demand from Chinese founders to set up operations there and rebrand themselves as Singapore-based, a move that has been dubbed “Singapore-washing”. The city-state’s neutrality is appealing as the US steps up its scrutiny of outbound capital to China.\n\nHongShan’s interest in south-east Asia comes at a time when some of Peak XV’s portfolio companies are facing difficulties.\n\nThe ecommerce group Zilingo went into liquidation in January after complaints of financial irregularities and the high-profile firing of its co-founder and chief executive.\n\nEducational technology provider Byju’s, once India’s most valuable start-up, lost that position after investors wrote down the value of their stakes. Last month, its auditor resigned over a lack of information provided for its accounts, and the company suffered a series of high-profile board departures, including Peak XV’s representative.\n\nHongShan told the Financial Times it had a “strong foundation of trust” with PeakXV and there would be opportunities for both teams to collaborate. “HongShan’s focus continues to be partnering with Chinese founders and supporting them on their globalisation journeys,” it said.\n\nPeak XV said: “The opportunities for collaboration [with HongShan] are far greater than the scope for competition.”",

They all use the same build of WordPress and they all rely on Woocommerce, an open-source plugin for small merchants.\n\nAnother repeated theme among these ecommerce sites is unlikely-sounding operating addresses. The head office of Sene, for example, is the site of what was once The Square restaurant in Mayfair:\n\n. . . and Kena appears to operate out of some super-prime real estate:\n\nHaving a bogus business address on an ecommerce website is not allowed, at least in the UK. The Advertising Standards Authority requires ads targeting UK consumers to be accurate and not contain any misleading information, including about where the operator is based. For example, in 2019 the ASA banned an ad for Wandsworth Plumbers after finding no evidence that it had a permanent base in Wandsworth.\n\nAn ASA spokesman said that without an investigation he couldn’t say whether any of the Twitter ads would be subject to its regulation.\n\nSo who’s really behind the sites? Our test orders through different shopfronts all resolved to the same company, a Singapore-registered dropshipping agent called Poxdo.\n\nMuch of the text on Poxdo’s website is identical to other, seemingly unrelated websites so it’s tricky to know what to trust. The contact page lists an address in downtown Singapore, within the Bugis Cube shopping centre, and mentions a warehouse in Yiwu, in the Zhejiang province of China.\n\nYiwu, “the world’s largest wholesale market for small manufactured goods”, was recently profiled by our colleagues on MainFT:\n\nPublic documents filed at Singapore’s corporate registry show Poxdo PTE Ltd was established in May 2020 and name two directors: Lee Ming Chung, a citizen of Singapore, and Nguyen Dac Manh of Ha Noi, Vietnam.\n\nOur efforts over several weeks to contact either director proved unsuccessful. Emails direct to Poxdo also went unanswered. Company secretary Thung Sai Fun of Ace Global Accountants and Auditors, when contacted on LinkedIn, did not respond to our requests for information about Poxdo and has since switched her profile to private.\n\nUnder Singapore law, a company must have at least one resident director on its board at all times. Foreigners setting up Singapore companies often recruit a local resident to be a passive, nominee director. Lee Ming Sung is a director of more than 60 disparate Singapore-incorporated companies and a shareholder of none, his registry record shows. (We’re including the original documents here because while all filings are public, the Singapore government’s BizFile service charges up to $50 per download request.)\n\nThe given address on the registration form for Nguyen Dac Manh, Poxdo’s other director and 100 per cent shareholder, is for an area of Hanoi rather than a residence or a specific street. Over the past two weeks we have reached out to numerous people with that name — there’s a Nguyen Dac Manh who promotes Vietnam real estate, for example, and a Nguyen Dac Manh who appears in promotional videos for Lazada, the Singapore-based ecommerce group. So far, none has responded.\n\nAn odd, possibly irrelevant tangent can be found buried on Poxdo’s website. As well as the visible pages detailing the company’s operations, there’s the unused framework of a WordPress- and WooCommerce-based storefront lying dormant in the background. Among its public but unlisted sections are template “author” and “blog” pages with holder posts credited to “Maximus Brainsby”. (The same framework appears elsewhere on the ecommerce web, such as for the Beeco storefront.)\n\nMaximus Brainsby Ltd was the name of a company incorporated in the UK in 2019 by a Vietnamese resident, Tuan Hoang Anh, and struck off in 2021. The name also appears on a messageboard for users of Shopify, in a thread complaining about traffic received from a product research tool called Pexgle. One poster quotes an email they say was signed “Maximus Brainsby, Co-Founder, Pexgle.”\n\nVietnam-based Pexgle advertises itself as an “all-in-one hunt winning products and ads toolkit for dropshippers and ecommerce entrepreneurs”. We’ve asked Pexgle and everyone we could find named Tuan Hoang Anh about dropshipping and Twitter ads; none has yet responded. If anyone ever wants to speak to us about anything, we’ll update this post accordingly.\n\nAsked to comment on the account suspensions, Twitter’s press office gave its standard automated response:",

    "body": "Singapore’s financial watchdog has fined financial institutions including DBS and Citigroup over breaches related to the Wirecard scandal, one of Europe’s biggest accounting frauds.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore said on Wednesday that DBS, OCBC, Citibank Singapore and Swiss Life Singapore had been fined a total of S$3.8mn ($2.8mn).\n\nThe regulator said the four financial institutions had “inadequate anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism controls in place when they dealt with persons who were involved in transactions with, or had links to, Wirecard AG or its related parties”. However, it said it had not found evidence of wilful misconduct in its investigation.\n\nOnce the darling of Germany’s fintech sector, Wirecard collapsed in 2020 after admitting that about €1.9bn in cash was missing from its accounts.\n\nThree of Wirecard’s most senior former executives have been on trial in Munich since December on charges of fraud, embezzlement and accounting and market manipulation. They include ex-chief executive Markus Braun, who denies wrongdoing.\n\nSingapore was central to the fraud, with many central figures in the scandal based in the Asian financial hub. On Tuesday, a state court handed down prison sentences to two former senior Wirecard finance executives, the first criminal convictions related to the collapse of the German payments group.\n\nDBS, Singapore’s biggest bank, received the largest fine on Wednesday of S$2.6mn (US$1.9mn). The company said it accepted the MAS decision on lapses.\n\n“While we detected and acted upon some of [the] activities through transaction monitoring and customer due diligence — and ultimately exited all relevant entities — we were unable to unravel the scheme in its entirety,” it said in a statement. “We acknowledge that we could have done better.”\n\nCiti, which was handed a S$400,000 penalty, said: “The case dates back to before June 2020 and since then we have taken steps to strengthen our know your customer process.”\n\nSwiss Life, which was given a S$200,000 fine, said it had co-operated with authorities and that it had since implemented additional measures to “detect client misconduct more effectively”.\n\nOCBC, which received a fine of S$600,000, said one of its business banking customers was implicated in the Wirecard case. The bank had “enhanced” its transaction monitoring, due diligence and know-your-customer processes in the past few years, it added.\n\nThe fines come ahead of the Singapore trial scheduled to start next month of James Henry O’Sullivan, another figure alleged to have played a central role in the Wirecard scandal. While O’Sullivan has not been charged in Germany, prosecutors in the Munich trial claim that companies the Englishman controlled extracted hundreds of millions of euros from the payments company before it crashed into insolvency.\n\nIn Singapore, O’Sullivan faces charges of abetting the falsification of documents, including papers that helped persuade Wirecard’s auditors at EY that the company had extensive cash reserves until it was forced to announce that €1.9bn recorded in its accounts did not exist. If convicted, he faces up to a decade in prison.\n\nAdditional reporting by Donato Mancini in London",

    "date": "2023-06-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC has accelerated dealmaking in the US, investing in venture capital funds and technology companies as it searches for growth beyond China.\n\nGIC, whose assets are estimated by analysts to exceed $700bn, has told private equity and venture capital executives this year that it wants to increase exposure to US-focused funds, said three people familiar with the investor’s thinking.\n\n“We cannot suggest opportunities fast enough,” said a partner at one global venture fund with a San Francisco office. “They are eager for what we have from San Francisco to Orlando.”\n\nThe focus on the US by one of Asia’s biggest sovereign wealth funds reflects optimism in the resilience of the country’s top technology companies despite last year’s heavy sell-off. The US is also prime hunting ground for artificial intelligence companies as the industry rapidly expands.\n\nIt also comes despite a collapse in funding for venture capital groups in the US and falling valuations for private companies. That slowdown could impact GIC’s investment levels over 2023, though interest in the US has remained high this year, the partner said.\n\nBut the US remains one of the biggest destinations for capital, especially in tech, as global investors rethink their strategy in China over concerns including geopolitical tensions with the US, an economic slowdown and a crackdown on business.\n\nGIC struck 63 deals involving US-based private companies including in technology, healthcare and property in 2022 and 2021, compared with 39 in 2019 and 2018, according to data by Refinitiv.\n\nBy comparison, ITjuzi, a data provider that monitors inflows to China, recorded two direct investments in Chinese companies by GIC last year, down from 16 in 2021.\n\nGIC declined to comment but has previously said it maintains significant exposure to large markets including China.\n\nA venture capitalist with offices in Silicon Valley said the company had held talks with GIC about raising its commitments to US funds, including in the secondary market. The latter is where private stakes in start-ups and VC funds change hands.\n\nGIC “indicated they were looking to ramp up hiring of investment specialists”, the person added. GIC is advertising 18 jobs in the US, according to LinkedIn. One post is for a specialist in the private equity secondary market as well as other senior roles in equities, fixed-income and portfolio management.\n\nGlobal investors who have relied on growth in China face a challenge finding alternatives. India and other emerging markets including Indonesia have not been able to match the mainland market in size and sophistication, even though their economic growth is higher than in developed markets including the US.\n\n“But there are only so many bets you can make in places like India and Indonesia. The US has much to offer across biotech, utilities, consumer companies and real estate,” said one Asia-based asset manager and adviser who spoke to GIC about its strategy. “However, there has been some question over tech valuations more recently which could affect the strategy.”\n\nThe US is GIC’s biggest market, making up 37 per cent of its portfolio according to its 2022 report, compared with 34 per cent in 2021. It does not break down its Asian portfolio, which represented 25 per cent of its holdings in 2022, excluding Japan. Its private market exposure has grown to 17 per cent from 12 per cent between 2022 and 2019.\n\nGIC, which has offices in San Francisco and New York, in April increased its stake in Nasdaq-listed US-Israeli fintech Pagaya, which uses AI to manage assets for financial institutions.\n\nGIC and Singapore’s other state investor Temasek became investors in Stripe, the San Francisco- and Dublin-based payments processing group, in March. Other recent deals include buying out software company Zendesk, an investment in blockchain data platform Chainalysis and joining a consortium to take cyber security platform McAfee private.\n\nAdditional reporting by George Hammond in San Francisco",

    "body": "Singaporean and other foreign investors are stepping up purchases of foreclosed properties in China, as Beijing’s crackdown on speculation and a slowing economy lead to a wave of defaults by developers.\n\nSales of Chinese distressed properties, including office buildings and factories, hit a quarterly record of $1.93bn in the last three months of 2022, according to MSCI, up 14 per cent from the same period a year earlier and 73 per cent higher than in 2019, the first year it tracked such data.\n\nBenjamin Chow, head of Asia real assets research at MSCI, said foreign buying had been more pronounced during this property downturn than in past ones in China. He linked the wave of developer defaults to a series of policies begun in 2021 to bring down leverage in the financial system.\n\nSingapore government-backed CapitaLand Investment highlighted the foreign interest in distressed Chinese properties in February when it raised a 1.1bn Singapore dollar ($820mn) fund to hunt for bargains in the Chinese commercial property sector.\n\n“The uncertainties in the market in the last two years have brought forth many opportunities, particularly in the special situations space, as developers continue to face [a] credit crunch,” Simon Treacy, chief executive of private equity real estate at CapitaLand, told Nikkei Asia in May.\n\nOne of the biggest distressed deals on the mainland came in October when CapitaLand agreed to pay Rmb2.04bn ($290mn) for a Beijing office building sold at auction after a default by Te Er Te, a property management company owned by Dalian-based developer Yongjia Group, court records show. The price represented a 30 per cent discount from its 2021 valuation.\n\nIn January, a Singapore-headquartered private equity manager with about $7bn of assets under management signed a deal with a Taiwanese manufacturer to buy a bankrupt logistics facility in China, said an executive with the buyer who asked not be named because he is not authorised to speak with the media.\n\n“We go after these manufacturers who have been hurting,” the executive said. “So if we look at where most of the pain is, we will continue to see select opportunities to refurbish [and] take over . . . underutilised or even bankrupt manufacturers.”\n\nSome western investors, including Brookfield Asset Management and Pictet Wealth Management, have also shown interest in such deals. Alexandre Tavazzi, Pictet’s managing director, said in Hong Kong last month that distressed properties in China have “become quite attractive”.\n\n“I do think there should be good opportunities to buy assets at good valuations over the next five years,” said Ronald Thompson, Hong Kong-based managing director of Alvarez & Marsal, which specialises in restructuring.\n\nHowever, MSCI’s Chow said other global investors have been more reluctant to invest in Chinese properties because of “concerns about long-term returns, particularly with China’s lower trajectory as it moves away from a reliance on the real estate sector to bolster GDP growth”.\n\nAdditional reporting by Pak Yiu.\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on June 13, 2023. ©2023 Nikkei Inc.

    "body": "Singapore has handed down prison sentences to two former senior Wirecard finance executives, the first criminal convictions related to the collapse of the once high-flying German payments group.\n\nJames Wardhana was sentenced to 21 months and Chai Ai Lim to 10 months by Singapore’s state court on Tuesday with immediate effect for conspiring to misappropriate funds. Both pleaded guilty after being charged in 2022 alongside two other people in connection with the case.\n\nThe rulings mark the first convictions for one of Europe’s biggest accounting frauds.\n\nWirecard, once worth €24bn and hailed as one of Europe’s most successful tech start-ups, collapsed in June 2020 after disclosing that half of its €2bn in annual revenue did not exist. The company’s implosion sent shockwaves through Germany’s financial and political establishment, and its Singaporean unit stopped payment activities in 2020.\n\nWardhana, a 40-year-old Indonesian citizen and permanent resident of Singapore, was the international finance process manager of Wirecard Asia. Chai, a 44-year-old Singaporean citizen, was the head of finance at Wirecard Asia. Both admitted to conspiring with their superior to embezzle funds from Wirecard Asia’s bank account. The prosecution noted that the two were active participants in the conspiracy.\n\nTheir superior, Edo Kurniawan, is still at large, with a warrant for his arrest and an Interpol red notice issued against him. Wirecard “lost contact” with Kurniawan, who led the group’s accounting in the Asia-Pacific region, 10 days after the Financial Times published its first report on suspected accounting irregularities at Wirecard and Kurniawan’s alleged central role in the affair.\n\nWirecard executives have been on trial in Munich since December last year. Three former senior managers of the disgraced German payments company, including chief executive Markus Braun, face charges of fraud, embezzlement and accounting and market manipulation in a trial that is expected to continue into at least 2024. He denies the charges.\n\nAttention will next month swing back to Singapore when the trial of James Henry O’Sullivan is scheduled to begin. The Englishman is not being charged in Germany but is alleged to be central to the Wirecard fraud.\n\nO’Sullivan faces charges of abetting the falsification of documents, including papers that helped persuade Wirecard’s auditors at EY that the company had extensive cash reserves until it was forced to announce that €1.9bn recorded in its accounts did not exist. If convicted, he faces up to a decade in prison.\n\nCompanies controlled by O’Sullivan received hundreds of millions of euros from Wirecard in loans and payments for assets in transactions spanning several years, according to whistleblowers and documents seen by the Financial Times. He has never commented publicly on the events.\n\nJan Marsalek, Markus Braun’s protégé and Wirecard’s former chief operating officer, remains at large, with some reports placing him in Moscow.",

    "blurb": "The city-state wants to become Asia’s go-to destination for emissions trading",
    "date": "2023-06-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "To businesses struggling to hit their emissions targets, they are a lifeline; to climate campaigners, they are a vehicle for greenwashing. But to Singapore, carbon markets are above all an opportunity: the Asian city-state is betting big on an area of finance that it thinks can only grow as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy.\n\nIn its race with Tokyo and Hong Kong to be the region’s premier business hub, Singapore wants to become the preferred financial centre for governments and businesses that inevitably need to interact with the global carbon market to cut their emissions.\n\nIts ambitions encompass both the largely unregulated international voluntary carbon market as well as the compliance carbon market — which is seen by governments as crucial to achieving carbon reduction targets.\n\nIn 2019, Singapore became the first country in south-east Asia to put a price on carbon — which companies will next year be able to offset by buying carbon credits. Last year, it went on to become the first in the region to launch a carbon exchange. It has also signed a string of deals with developing countries on carbon credit collaboration.\n\nMuch of Singapore’s ambition is born of necessity. With its 5.5mn population and tiny size, it has no natural resources of its own. But its central position in Asia allows it to serve as a bridge between established carbon markets in the west and emerging markets in the region. It can facilitate the flow of carbon credits and investments and, thereby, potentially accelerate its own emissions reduction plans.\n\n“For a number of years now, Singapore has had ambitions in relation to hosting financial markets but, in particular, carbon markets,” says Pedro Barata, associate vice-president of carbon markets for the Environmental Defense Fund, a US non-profit organisation. “It wants to play a central role in terms of carbon trading in the region. Nobody else in Asia, to my knowledge, is trying to create similar infrastructure like Singapore.”\n\nA large part of that ambition is focused on voluntary carbon trading — a system that allows the buying and selling of carbon credits internationally to incentivise and regulate emissions reductions.\n\nIf Singapore can harness the opportunity, it stands to benefit enormously from a market that could be worth $50bn by 2030, according to the consultancy McKinsey.\n\nBut it is a system that has been beset by controversies in recent months. Critics say it allows companies to continue polluting without materially contributing to reducing their emissions.\n\nCarbon offsets were even described as an “oxymoron” by the independent Carbon Market Watch group, given the example of tree planting in China to offset the emissions generated by Shell in producing gas that was marketed as “carbon neutral” — as first reported in the FT.\n\nIn the past 18 months, such schemes have proliferated, many unverified. The pledges for carbon removal through tree planting, for example, would require a land area the size of the US, scientific studies have concluded. Furthermore, forests in the US that generated offsets bought by companies including BP and Microsoft were burnt in summer fires, calling into question their value.\n\n“It is an interesting time to be going all in on carbon trading, but their reputation is good and you would probably trust an exchange in Singapore over say, Malaysia, Thailand or even Hong Kong,” says one Singapore-based carbon trader, who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nSingapore’s government has acknowledged the challenge of ensuring that carbon credits uphold high environmental integrity standards. In February, it said that this year it would publish a “white list” of credits that would be acceptable for offsetting Singapore companies’ taxable carbon emissions. This list will include approved host countries, programmes and methodologies.\n\n“We know this market is missing trust . . . Singapore has the right pedigree,” says Mikkel Larsen, chief executive of Climate Impact X, a global exchange and marketplace for carbon credits based in Singapore. “It has the basic infrastructure and experience with creating new markets.”\n\nJointly established by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered and state investor Temasek, CIX launched its first nature-based standardised contract this month. The credits covered by the contract are generated through schemes that protect forests that would otherwise be destroyed or degraded, it says. Eligible projects include rainforests and biodiversity reserves in Asia, Africa and South America.\n\n“Singapore’s emissions are large for a country of its size and it has no real means of getting to net zero,” says Vidur Nayar, head of Asia-Pacific environmental trading at Hartree Partners, a global energy and commodities trading group. “But the commodity traders are all here and so, naturally, you are seeing growth in carbon trading, too.”\n\nGiving added heft to Singapore’s push is some good old-fashioned incentivising. The city-state will allow companies to use high-quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable greenhouse gas emissions from 2024. While relatively low now, at S$5 per tonne, the tax will rise to S$25 per tonne in 2024, and S$45 from 2026.\n\nVoluntary markets are only part of Singapore’s strategy, however. The country also has its sights set on compliance markets, which are established by governments as a means of cutting national emissions through mandatory cap and trade schemes. These are mechanisms where carbon emitters buy or sell credits based on whether they exceed or undershoot emissions limits set by the government.\n\nAsia is one of the biggest growth areas for compliance markets: both South Korea and, more recently, China have established emissions trading schemes, and Indonesia and India will soon follow.\n\nUnder Article 6 of the 2015 Paris climate accord — the UN agreement to limit global warming to 2C, and preferably 1.5C, above pre-industrial levels — countries can also co-operate to share the benefits of emissions reduction schemes, in order to hit their national decarbonisation targets.\n\nIn May, Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding with Bhutan to co-operate on carbon credits under the terms of Article 6.\n\nThis deal was the 10th such MoU: other nations that have signed up with Singapore include Colombia, Kenya, Peru and Vietnam.\n\nExperts say that companies operating in multiple countries will prefer a central, trusted venue for trading the credits that compliance schemes create — and Singapore wants to be that venue.\n\n“It is Singapore saying . . . we will be your outlet, we will be your go-to financial centre for trading these, we will assist you with those trades, including getting the recognition of international standards,” says Barata from the Environmental Defense Fund.",

    "blurb": "As key customers of Digital Core REIT have stumbled, questions over disclosure have arisen",
    "date": "2023-06-1300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore is thriving as an Asian finance hub. Record amounts of capital are flowing into the city-state from China, south-east Asia, the US and elsewhere. Not only did Singapore gain from the closure of rival Hong Kong during the pandemic but the nation has benefited from a more neutral approach in a world marked by geopolitical polarisation.\n\nBut it has struggled with its ambitions for a key part of its finance hub strategy — to develop a thriving stock market with a pipeline of new equity listings. Monthly delistings often outnumber new companies and the number of quoted companies has fallen from 720 at the start of 2020 to 645 as of April. The Straits Times index for the market has essentially flatlined over the past five years, excluding a Covid-related dip and recovery.\n\nAnd the market has been delivered a fresh blow by the dismal performance of a high-profile listing of a foreign business, Digital Core REIT. It is not just a matter of a steep share price decline. The circumstances of the real estate investment trust’s problems raise questions over the level of disclosure required on the market.\n\nThe owner of data centres in the US, Toronto and Frankfurt was spun out of US property group Digital Realty and was Singapore’s biggest equity listing by funds raised of the past five years and the fourth largest over the past decade, according to Dealogic. The company’s shares have dropped 35 per cent from the offer price and 60 per cent from an early 2022 high.\n\nA key factor in that slide has been problems with two major tenants. Earlier this month, data centre operator Cyxtera, reported to be Digital Core REIT’s second-biggest customer, went bankrupt. The company has accounted for about 22 per cent of the trust’s rental revenue income.\n\nCyxtera’s troubles have been documented by the media since at least the beginning of this year. But until recently investors would have not known about them by reading only the disclosures by Digital Core REIT, or even that it was a very big customer of the trust. According to management, the Singapore-listed group is typically bound by confidentiality provisions in lease agreements.\n\nNor was the identity of the trust’s reportedly fifth-largest customer, Sungard, disclosed at the time of the IPO. Sungard went bankrupt for a second time in April 2022 — just four months after Digital Core REIT’s IPO. The trust informed investors of the bankruptcy of its fifth-biggest tenant 10 days after Sungard had filed in the US. It did not mention Sungard, which had accounted for about 7 per cent of the trust’s rental revenue, by name.\n\nIt was not until April that there was any mention of the troubles facing Cyxtera, when the trust released responses to shareholder questions. Cyxtera filed for bankruptcy protection two months later on June 4. This time the failure was disclosed the next day, though Cyxtera was still not mentioned by name.\n\nUnder Singapore’s continuous disclosure rules, companies have to disclose information that would be likely to materially affect the price or value of their securities. The exception is if the information is confidential, prepared for internal management purposes or concerns an incomplete negotiation. The Singapore Exchange says: “We have been assessing the information flow and promptness of disclosures bearing in mind the impact on the Reit’s financials.”\n\nMak Yuen Teen, a professor at the National University of Singapore, says if Digital Core REIT had been listed in the US, some of its “tardy disclosures” might have seen investors “come after them”.\n\nA Digital Core REIT spokesperson said: “Upon learning that its second-largest customer had filed for bankruptcy, Digital Core REIT immediately requested a trading halt and promptly provided robust and timely disclosures . . . In general, we believe it is inappropriate to speculate or comment on any customer’s financial condition or course of action.” The company earlier told shareholders it expected “minimal impact” from the bankruptcy.\n\nBut the poor performance of Digital Core REIT’s share price speaks to the reduced confidence in the company’s prospects and the assets chosen for its portfolio. In seeking to attract more listings, it seems fair to ask: did Singapore get a poor deal with Digital Core REIT? The city-state has developed into something of a hub for Reits but as a centre for stock exchange listings, it has not matched its business achievements elsewhere. The woes of Digital Core REIT underline the importance of quality in listing candidates and strong regulation to ensure market integrity if it wants to do better.\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com",

    "body": "CSOP Asset Management is gearing up to launch what it claims will be Singapore’s first exchange traded fund focusing on the technology industry across south-east Asia and India.\n\nThe fund firm is aiming to raise up to $30mn by June 20, when the ETF will officially list on the Singapore bourse, with a longer-term goal of hitting $100mn in assets within the first year.\n\nThe CSOP iEdge Southeast Asia+ TECH Index ETF will be listed on the Singapore Exchange on June 20. The fund will track the iEdge Southeast Asia+ TECH Index, which provides exposure to 30 tech firms across six south-east Asian markets and India across information technology, software, retail, car manufacturing, and electronic components and manufacturing.\n\nJust under 28 per cent of the portfolio is in electronics components and manufacturing, followed by a 19 per cent allocation to software and consulting companies and 16 per cent to miscellaneous retail.\n\nUS-listed companies with origins in south-east Asia and India make up the largest portion by market with a weighting of 43 per cent, followed by 18 per cent for Thailand, 15 per cent for Indonesia, 12 per cent for Singapore and 11 per cent for Malaysia.\n\nWang Yi, Hong Kong-based head of quantitative investment at CSOP AM, said a key factor behind the creation of the ETF was growing client demand for allocations to south-east Asia.\n\nThe challenge for investors in accessing the region is the fact that it is “a little fragmented” and there is no “aggregate portfolio they can easily access”, Wang argued.\n\nThe ETF invests in both locally listed companies, as well as the US stocks of local companies via American depositary receipts, which is how the ETF gets exposure to Indian companies, he explained.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based asset manager, which entered the Singapore market in 2019, believes the local tech sector is set to benefit from a combination of strong regional economic growth, a growing middle class, and a shift in industrial manufacturing capabilities away from China and into south-east and south Asia.\n\nExports from south-east Asia rose from $474bn in 2003 to $1.713tn in 2021, the firm noted, citing research from the Observatory of Economic Complexity, with much of this growth coming from the tech sector.\n\nThe firm said that south-east Asia was also expected to have 140mn new consumers by 2030, with the middle-classes expected to account for just under 70 per cent of the total regional population in the same period, citing World Economic Forum data.\n\nThe digital economy sector in the region grew at a compound annual growth rate of 24 per cent between 2019 and 2022 as well, with India seeing a compound annual growth rate of 16 per cent in the same period, according to research from Google, Temasek and Bain & Company.\n\nThe region should also benefit from what the firm refers to as the “fifth round of industrial relocation”, where manufacturing capabilities are now shifting from China to south-east Asia, after earlier shifts from the UK to the US, the US to Japan, Japan to the so-called four tigers of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, and from the four tigers to China.\n\nAs more manufacturing and industrial facilities relocate to the region, CSOP AM anticipates income to grow, leading to more growth opportunities for regional tech companies and service providers, who should benefit as local consumers spend more on tech and tech services such as ride-sharing applications, Wang said.\n\nLocally listed ETF assets in Singapore shrunk slightly in the first four months of this year, however, falling from $8.17bn at the end of 2022 to $8.03bn by the end of April, according to Singapore Exchange data — far below the $9.19bn figure at the end of 2021.\n\nThis latest ETF could also potentially be on the table to be cross-listed into the Chinese market via the recently announced ETF scheme between the Singapore Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange, Wang said.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

    "date": "2023-06-0800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s new carbon exchange traded 12,000 tonnes of emissions on its first trading day as the city-state bets on the growth of an industry that has been slammed for corporate greenwashing.\n\nChevron, Vitol, Standard Chartered and China’s CICC on Wednesday traded credits on Climate Impact X, which is hoping to challenge other global exchanges run by US-based CME Group and Xpansiv in establishing a benchmark price for voluntary carbon trading.\n\nSingapore is trying to leverage its status as a business hub in Asia to be the main carbon trading platform in the region. By winning enough liquidity from international carbon traders, it hopes to become a global price setter for carbon credits and lay the groundwork for an eventual futures market.\n\nCIX, a joint venture among Singapore Exchange, state investor Temasek and banks DBS and Standard Chartered, said the initial price established for its physical carbon credits was $5.36 per tonne, about four times that for a similar nature-based contract at CBL, the world’s leading carbon exchange. Volumes on Wednesday were small as expected.\n\nVoluntary carbon trading is a system that directs financing to climate-related projects. In buying carbon credits — certificates that represent quantities of greenhouse gases kept out of the air or removed from it — companies can offset their own emissions. The credits come from projects around the world that protect and support nature.\n\nThe industry is expected to grow as countries transition to low-carbon economies. A key challenge in carbon offsetting is how to price the credits, which is behind the efforts to launch spot and futures markets.\n\nBut a series of scandals related to credits linked to projects of questionable quality has dented enthusiasm among traders and hit volumes.\n\nThis has led to low prices on established exchanges, with CBL’s credits trading at about $1.15 on the exchange. That value is much less than the $5-$10 price range companies believe is their fair value, discouraging trade.\n\nCIX’s experiment has been to provide a contract with fewer but higher-quality projects to compete with CBL and CME. It hopes to eventually establish stable trading volumes.\n\n“It would be wrong to say [the scandals] have not put a dent in the market. Right now the market is a little bit more choppy than it was before” said Mikkel Larsen, chief executive at CIX.\n\n“We could have waited for better times, but we decided not to. Building a carbon hub is not something you do overnight. If Singapore stopped and started every time something pushes against this, they will never get there.”\n\nThe credits covered by the contract are generated through schemes that protect forests which would otherwise be destroyed or degraded, according to CIX. The basket of 11 projects include rainforests and biodiversity reserves in Asia, Africa and South America.\n\n“By excluding projects traders don’t like or trust, CIX are basically trying to create the Brent or similar index for carbon that sets a better benchmark,” said one carbon trader based in Singapore. Brent is the world’s most important crude oil benchmark.\n\nSingapore has another carbon exchange called AirCarbon, a blockchain-based platform, but it has not had much traction with traders.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nAirCarbon ‘sees strong interest from traders’ / From Thomas McMahon and William Pazos, Co-Founders, ACX, Singapore",

    "blurb": "Post-pandemic success comes as Hong Kong carrier struggles to recover",
    "date": "2023-05-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Just as Singapore Airlines was giving employees an eight-month salary bonus after record profits, Hong Kong was giving away more than 4,400 free tickets for regional rival Cathay Pacific as the city sought to encourage visitors to return.\n\nShares of Singapore Airlines have soared to their highest levels in more than three years after the national carrier made clear the strength of its post-coronavirus pandemic recovery with an annual profit of S$2.16bn ($1.6bn) for the year ending in March.\n\nIn stark contrast, shares in Hong Kong-listed Cathay Pacific have dropped nearly 40 per cent from a high in April 2019. In March, the airline unveiled a HK$6.5bn ($830mn) loss for 2022 and shares have remained flat since.\n\nTheir financial divergence reflects the rise of Singapore, one of the first countries in Asia to reopen its borders after the pandemic, and the burnishing of its status as a business hub. Hong Kong, on the other hand, remained largely closed off to travel until late last year, losing its status as the region’s busiest airport to Singapore in 2022. Its slow reopening has affected Cathay Pacific, which is also reeling from labour shortages.\n\n“Singapore was ahead of everyone last year in Asia-Pacific [with the reopening],” said Brendan Sobie, an independent aviation analyst based in Singapore. “They benefited from that tremendously.\n\n“I don’t think Cathay’s first financial year after reopening will look like Singapore’s,” he added. “That honeymoon period caused by supply and demand imbalance is waning — they’ve largely missed out on those market conditions.”\n\nHong Kong tourism is still very early in its recovery, which is reflected in the carrier numbers. Singapore Airlines has reached nearly 80 per cent of pre-pandemic passenger capacity, while Cathay Pacific is still at less than 50 per cent.\n\nSingapore Airlines and its wholly owned budget airline Scoot carried 2.7mn passengers in April, an 85 per cent year-on-year increase and just under the 3.1mn passengers they flew in the same month in 2019. Cathay Pacific carried 1.4mn passengers in April 2023, about 44 per cent of the number in April 2019.\n\nAt its annual meeting this month, Cathay’s chief executive Ronald Lam said the airline was unlikely to exceed 70 per cent of pre-Covid passenger capacity before the end of this year, citing labour constraints.\n\nAn average of 10 to 15 senior pilots have quit Cathay Pacific each month this year, said the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association, down from about 30 to 50 each month in the second half of last year.\n\nThe airline — which had a crew of 3,800 pilots in late 2019 — lost more than 1,800 pilots over the past three years, according to union chair Paul Weatherilt, but has only recruited about 400 new pilots. After seeing wage cuts of up to 40 per cent in 2020, pilots remain disgruntled, the union said.\n\nCathay Pacific said the “attrition rate has normalised across all staff groups” including pilots, adding that crew base pay has risen by 3.3 per cent from the beginning of this year.\n\n“Besides Hong Kong having a later reopening timeline than other aviation hubs, Cathay’s slower recovery pace reflects [its] ongoing challenges with supply constraints across the aviation ecosystem . . . [such as] availability of certified manpower,” JPMorgan analyst Karen Li wrote in a note in March.\n\nWith wages now calculated by flight time, Hong Kong aviation officials have advised Cathay that some of their pilots have been taxiing on the runway at “considerably slower speeds”, according to an internal Cathay memo seen by the Financial Times.\n\nIn a further sign of crisis, Cathay fired three cabin crew after a clip accusing them of joking about a Mandarin Chinese-speaking customer’s English language ability went viral. Chief executive Lam said it had caused “significant damage to the image of Hong Kong and Cathay”. But Cathay’s flight attendants’ union hit back, complaining of low morale, increased workload and lower salaries.\n\nSingapore Airlines, on the other hand, told local media it had brought back most of the 3,000-plus pilots — many of whom had been furloughed — by the middle of last year. Only a “very small number” left during the pandemic, management said at the time.\n\nSingapore Airlines historically does not provide much detail on its staff, citing commercial reasons. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince the pandemic, Singapore has gained more transit traffic that traditionally went through Hong Kong.\n\n“Singapore Airlines [did] well last year because they functioned as the only realistic transit hub in all of Asia,” a senior Asian airline executive said. Cathay reported a 68 per cent drop in sales originating from the Americas to $572mn in 2022 compared with 2019. Singapore Airlines had a 46 per cent increase in sales originating from the Americas to $1.1bn in the 12 months to the end of March this year, compared with the 12 months to the end of March 2020.\n\nThe booming market conditions that boosted Singapore Airlines’ bottom line are not expected to last. And Hong Kong is throwing billions of dollars towards luring back international business and tourists, such as with its recent Cathay campaign.\n\n“We are still in a dynamic period, and many of us believe most of the benefits have been temporary,” said one Singapore Airlines executive. “I’m not sure we will see a profit like that again. Calling a winner seems too early.”",

    "body": "Singaporean state investor Temasek cut the pay of staff responsible for its failed $275mn investment in FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed last year.\n\nTemasek, one of the world’s largest investors, said it was “disappointed” with the investment and the “negative impact on our reputation”, after it was criticised for backing the start-up. The investment constituted 0.09 per cent of its S$403bn (US$298bn) portfolio.\n\n“Although there was no misconduct by the investment team in reaching their investment recommendation, the investment team and senior management, who are ultimately responsible for investment decisions made, took collective accountability and had their compensation reduced,” Temasek said on Monday.\n\nThe statement concluded Temasek’s review of the deal, which was launched in November 2022, the same month FTX filed for bankruptcy. The Singaporean investor was hit by a rare public backlash after details behind its failed bet became public.\n\nTemasek defended its “eight-month due diligence” process but critics questioned whether even basic checks were done into the start-up, which at one point was valued at $40bn when Bankman-Fried was in effect serving as the face of the crypto industry. Temasek described its trust in former chief executive Bankman-Fried as “misplaced”.\n\nLawrence Wong, Singapore’s deputy prime minister, told parliament last year that Temasek’s losses were “disappointing” and had caused reputational damage for the city-state. Ho Ching, the former Temasek chief who is the wife of Singapore’s leader, Lee Hsien Loong, called the fund’s loss “egg on our face”.\n\nTemasek’s failed bet further compromised confidence in Singapore’s ability to regulate the digital assets industry. Singapore had encouraged crypto companies to set up operations locally and allowed both retail and institutional investors to trade in the risky asset class.\n\nBut a series of crypto failures connected to the city-state in 2022, including the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto platform Hodlnaut, put the city-state under scrutiny.\n\nExperts warned that the report may fuel more criticism because it did not offer many details about the FTX investment and the due diligence process.\n\n“It remains to be seen but there is a risk that such a cursory report may — rightly or wrongly — fuel public dissatisfaction rather than assuage them,” said Kelvin Low, a law professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nTemasek, whose funds are largely sourced from the return on its own investments, has doubled the value of its portfolio to S$403bn over the past decade according to the latest public information, largely thanks to its big bets on China and tech. It has made a number of investments into crypto and blockchain companies globally but maintains that its overall exposure to the sector is minimal.",

    "body": "The Cayman Islands has launched a fightback against attempts by Singapore and Hong Kong to rival it as a favourite destination for Asia’s hedge funds and super-rich to park assets.\n\nCayman Islands financial services minister André Ebanks visited Singapore and Hong Kong this month to advance plans to set up an office in one of the two Asian cities. It would be the Cayman Islands’ first base in Asia, and its officials would help investors to set up and manage funds based in the Caribbean territory.\n\nThe move comes after Singapore and Hong Kong approved new fund structures that offer international investors a way to shelter money in lightly taxed vehicles, with government subsidies to cover some set-up costs.\n\nUse of Singapore’s new “variable capital companies” has exploded since they were introduced in 2020, with 889 set up so far — a pace investors say has taken even regulators by surprise as Chinese money floods into the city-state.\n\nUptake of Hong Kong’s “open-ended fund companies” has been slower, but 64 were set up in 2022, up from 40 a year earlier.\n\nThere are far more such vehicles in the Cayman Islands, but officials in the British overseas territory “think there’s a threat to their position”, said a Hong Kong-based funds specialist briefed on the initiative. “They haven’t had as much competition before.”\n\nThe Cayman Islands had been planning to set up an office in Asia for years, but the rapid take-up of the Singapore and Hong Kong vehicles has prompted more urgency, according to two people with knowledge of officials’ thinking.\n\n“Minister Ebanks and I . . . had meetings with a number of local officials, agencies and law firms [in Hong Kong and Singapore] on matters related to opening and operating a Cayman Islands government office,” said Gene DaCosta, the Cayman Islands’ representative for Asia, in response to questions from the Financial Times. “No decision has been taken as yet on the location.”\n\nThe Cayman Islands delegation met hedge fund executives, fund lawyers and trade bodies for the private equity, hedge fund and venture capital industries, said people with knowledge of the trip.\n\nOne financier whose firm uses Cayman funds said the officials were seeking to reaffirm their relationship in the face of what was likely to become sharper competition from Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n“It was very much a two-way process, for the [Cayman Islands] government to meet stakeholders and get feedback about the jurisdiction,” said Ann Ng, a Hong Kong-based partner at the Cayman Islands law firm Maples Group who accompanied the officials to some of their meetings.\n\nThe pitch to Asian investors considering the Hong Kong and Singapore vehicles was that “Cayman funds represent the ‘old faithful’ of the investment world — tried, tested and trusted”, said a Singapore-based adviser who had talks with the delegation.\n\nThe Cayman Islands “have one particular strength: they are far away from the long arm of the Beijing government”, said another Singapore-based financial adviser who met the Cayman Islands delegation.\n\n“Hong Kong can’t really argue that, and Singapore might have trouble, too, down the track with how things are going with mainland inflows,” the adviser said. A rush of capital from wealthy Chinese people into Singapore has become a politically sensitive issue in the city-state.\n\nSeveral of the people said Hong Kong’s deeper capital markets and longer history as a global financial centre would until recently have made it the obvious choice for the Cayman Islands office. However, large numbers of companies, funds and family offices have relocated to Singapore in recent years.",

    "blurb": "People have been anticipating the cultural renaissance of this snoozy island nation for nearly 15 years. Is it finally here?",
    "date": "2023-05-1700:00:00.0",
    "body": "It feels like déjà vu: back in Singapore, back to unpacking the topic of whether the buttoned-up country might be poised to emerge as Asia’s new capital of cool. Singapore’s presumptive rise as a destination in its own right – worth travelling for, rather than just transiting through – has been touted more than once in the past 15-odd years. In 2009, the catalyst was the city hosting an F1 night race and a concert, F1 Rocks, with Nobu Matsuhisa dispatching nigiri to VIPs in the pit and Beyoncé as a headline act. In 2013 it was a critical mass of chefs, mixologists and cultural venues with international talent behind them; in 2017, a similar set of addresses, all created by Singaporeans. Each time there was a groundswell of local enthusiasm, with creative types and Tourism Board officials labouring to lend substance to the “Singabore no more!” claim. And each time, out on the still-pretty-snoozy Singapore street, it was, if not quite failure to launch, also never quite the zeitgeist combustion everyone hoped for.\n\nNow there’s renewed speculation that this staid island nation of 5.5 million might be having a(nother?) moment; but this time spurred in part by outside forces – regional business shifts and the geopolitical machinations of Singapore’s powerful neighbour, resulting in influxes of people, and wealth, from both Hong Kong and mainland China. FT reports estimate that more than 800 family offices have been established since the end of 2021; 2022-23 saw around 500 Chinese family offices, private-equity firms and wealth managers open or redomicile. (Singapore has already long been a base for UHNW residents from neighbouring Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.) Meta, Google and Apple all have their Asia-Pacific HQs here; some Hong Kong-based banks are relocating senior staff; blockchain and tech start-ups abound. The new expats – and the scads of capital they bring, along with the odd pearl-pink Bentley – are a favourite topic of conversation. (Likewise the city’s skyrocketing rents: friends talk of being pushed out of central neighbourhoods by rent hikes, while newly arrived mainlanders sign $100,000-a-month leases on penthouse flats and the city’s sought-after black-and-white colonial houses. In April, the government announced it would double its tax on private property purchases by foreigners to 60 per cent, in a move to cool a housing boom that has in part been driven by buyers from mainland China.)\n\nDo the decoupling and diversification up there really account for cultural shifts down here? Culture in general, whether grassroots or institutional, is still one of Singapore’s more persistent challenges. The two factors collided in January at the inauguration of ART SG, the contemporary fair created by The Art Assembly, the team behind Art HK (now Art Basel Hong Kong). More than 160 galleries – both big names (Gagosian, Lehmann Maupin, White Cube, David Zwirner) and boutique stars such as the Paris-founded Almine Rech and Belgian-based Xavier Hufkens – convened at Marina Bay Sands Expo & Convention Centre, with an estimated 43,000 international art enthusiasts and powerhouse regional collectors. “You had some heavy-hitting galleries, which is a good indication of their belief in the market,” says Singaporean art adviser Talenia Phua Gajardo, whose company, The Artling, has both corporate and private clients across the Asia-Pacific region. “They’re not unrealistic; they know it’s not ‘do a booth and they will come’ – they need time to build networks. The goal was to position Singapore as a hub for connecting with regional collectors, and [those collectors] were all here. And the stuff in the peripheral programming was high-quality, which was gratifying to see.”\n\nArt-world acquaintances posted on social media from SEA Focus, the south-east Asian contemporary art‑curation platform spearheaded by STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery (one of the city’s few internationally renowned arts venues), and from SAM, the Singapore Art Museum. This year, both of them were at Tanjong Pagar Distripark, a multistorey complex at the edge of the water that has in the past two years been emerging as a new arts cluster in its own right: SAM moved into new premises here in 2022, and the site already houses a handful of galleries.\n\nThere were also party shots from off-fair venues, exhibiting degrees of glamour and even a bit of raucousness that looked downright un-Singaporean. “I just felt there was something different,” says Alan Lo, the Hong Kong-born restaurateur, food-tech investor and philanthropist – he’s the co-founder of Duddell’s in his home city – of the energy during the event. Lo moved his family to Singapore during the pandemic, trading Hong Kong’s bristle of towers and peaks for Singapore’s fewer, and newer, ones, their sides sometimes furred with vertical greenery; the weaving shophouse-lined streets of Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar, incense still floating from the odd TCM purveyor lodged between two cocktail bars; and its justifiably world-famous 200-acre Botanic Gardens, where wizened qi gong practitioners trace arcane shapes in the air next to tabard-clad bootcampers from Melbourne or Leeds, amid broad-leaf mahogany and tembusu trees.\n\nLo intends to divide his time going forward: “Maybe it has to do with the fact that we’ve seen an influx of new people, whether from the mainland, or all the crypto guys, the tech and VC scenes that have also obviously been growing too. Whatever it was, it’s no longer the sleepy island state that it used to be – it’s more diverse, and dynamic. The pace is still slower than Hong Kong, but you don’t need that intensity all the time.\n\n“And of course, the food scene.” Yes, that. Eating, drinking and nightlife (albeit a tame interpretation thereof) are where the city hit its stride some years ago. Ask a cocktail impresario anywhere in the world which Asian capital is on their radar, and Singapore is likely to be it. Breweries and distilleries now operate alongside homegrown bar concepts, many of them gorgeously designed: from classics such as 28 HongKong Street and Jigger & Pony to Atlas (with its 26ft gin “tower”), Junior The Pocket Bar (named for the teeny-weeny dimensions of its space on Ann Siang Hill), and buzzy newcomers Underdog Inn and Sago House. Singaporeans and the expats who call the city home love a tipple, and they love the new. Not for nothing did exclusive London wine club 67 Pall Mall choose Singapore as the site of its third location last year (and what a location: the 27th-floor flat overlooking Orchard Road formerly belonging to legendary film producer Runme Shaw; the room that was allegedly his bedroom is now known as the “Naughty Corner”).\n\nIn the restaurant world, “you’re seeing that ‘adding to the local tapestry’ thing a lot in food and drink”, says Wee Teng Wen, founder of The Lo & Behold Group. Wee has helped to create some of the city’s favourite addresses: Odette, the modern fine-dining venue, took home the “number-one in Asia” kudos at the 2019 San Pellegrino World’s Best awards. (His wife, Dawn Ng, is one of Singapore’s few internationally collected and represented artists; a large installation of her work graced the National Gallery Singapore’s atrium during the Fair.)\n\n“Chefs are reviving old histories, old recipes,” he continues – and doing innovative new things with them. He and Alan Lo both cite Malcolm Lee, a young local who made his name reinterpreting the homey Straits-Chinese dishes of his childhood at a restaurant called Candlenut. Last year Candlenut’s business partner, Christina Ong (she of COMO hotels fame), also backed Lee’s new venture, Pangium, in a stunning space overlooking the city’s Botanic Gardens. “It’s Straits fine degustation – tasting menus done in a way no one else has,” says Wee.\n\nSingaporeans have COMO’s Ong to thank in part for the evolution of Dempsey Hill, the leafy colonial army barracks-turned-lifestyle destination off Holland Road. Not that Singapore’s urban critical mass is ever especially overwhelming, the clingy humidity notwithstanding; but Dempsey has always been a shady, sedate reprieve atop its hill off Holland Road. Plane trees, their trunks covered in ferns, spread wide, dappled shade over green lawns between the barracks buildings, whose red-tiled roofs and whitewashed colonnades cast a faint bygone-era energetic shadow. Its cafés, shops and restaurants have historically been of varying quality but enduringly popular with the city’s Anglo-Euro expat community (for every wagyu burger or margarita joint, a fancy kids’ clobber boutique). Since about 2012, however, Ong has been upgrading in calculated increments. She partnered with Jean-Georges Vongerichten on The Dempsey Cookhouse & Bar, in the same barracks that holds Candlenut; London’s Dover Street Market is now in the one across from it. Culina, her cushy bistro-traiteur – already a Dempsey stalwart for some years – was fitted into larger, slicker premises alongside her other venues. Grandiflora, Sydney’s famous floral designers, now has a kiosk. The whole is known as COMO Dempsey, and has become a destination in its own right.\n\nThe halo effect has drawn other names. Australian chef Dave Pynt’s unique carnivore-centric take on modern American barbecue at his restaurant, Burnt Ends, has a diehard following in Singapore and beyond (and earned him a Michelin star). Last year he moved the restaurant’s Chinatown digs to a spectacular – and 10 times larger – space in Dempsey: all wood cladding, bold hanging lights, gleaming copper details and a long, long dining bar. “So much money has poured into Singapore,” Pynt says. “The volume of people who come through your door… they’re quite casual here, you know, but they’ve got budgets.”\n\nImportant multinational lifestyle hotel brands are betting on these budgets. The Standard and Edition Hotels groups have planted flags in the vicinity of mall-lined Orchard Road; both will open by early 2024. Talk on the ground has it that Ennismore’s The Hoxton has been in talks about a site in Jalan Besar, east of the CBD (a neighbourhood described by one local friend as “the Shoreditch of Singapore, such as that is”). Raffles reopened in late 2019 after a two-year, multimillion-pound renovation, and has never been better: all its verandas, spinning fans and four-poster-bed charms intact, but with showcase-y new bars and restaurants, a huge spa and glittering public spaces. A second Raffles, this one a resort, is being developed amid the yacht clubs and tony apartment complexes of Sentosa Island, off Singapore’s south coast.\n\nThe Artling’s Gajardo, meanwhile, is busy installing the art collection she was commissioned to create for the Mondrian Singapore Duxton. The new-build tower rises 13 storeys above Tanjong Pagar, a Chinatown-adjacent neighbourhood of weaving, shophouse-lined streets, small parks and fragrant temples that is historically one of Singapore’s primary nightlife hubs; an ace location, in other words. When it opens next month – with 302 rooms and suites, multiple restaurants and bars, a rooftop pool, and art by the likes of Ian Davenport and Andre Wee adorning its walls – the Mondrian will offer experiences that tie guests into the culture of the surrounding streets: hawker centre deep-dives, cult cocktail bars and small museums.\n\nLo & Behold’s Wee is already a hotelier; the Group opened the 37-room Warehouse Hotel, in a listed former go-down (local vernacular for a shipping warehouse) that was once a discothèque, in 2017, and it remains one of the city’s cooler stays. These days, he’s contending with co-living spaces, which are part of the company’s most ambitious project to date: the redevelopment of a former girls’ school, a full 230,000sq ft of empty space near Robertson Quay, a street or so away from the Singapore River. “The scale is kind of scary,” he admits with a smile. “But it goes back to what we do as a group, which is always about filling the gaps in the lifestyle ecosystem.” When it’s finished – some time next year, Wee reckons – the site will include boutiques with local designers and makers as tenants, a few curated eating and drinking outlets (of course), and an art exhibition and education space in the old hall. Lo & Behold will operate a couple of these restaurants; the rest are tendered out. “There are so many great local creatives and entrepreneurs – in retail, wellness, design – who are just completely off the radar,” Wee says. “Most don’t fit into the mall thing, which is still the primary retail platform, so they’re dislocated all over the city. The idea is to bring them together.\n\n“I’m excited about this neighbourhood,” he says earnestly, warming to a topic he knows more about than most Singaporeans. “It’s a good expat mix; it’s equidistant between Orchard Road and the CBD. But it’s very under-served. Because most of the F&B runs along the quay, there’s no nucleus; we want to create that nucleus.” Worth revisiting the city in a year’s time again, then – déjà vu or no.",

    "body": "Hello everyone, this is Akito in Singapore.\n\nAs the impact of US-China decoupling spreads, the presence of leading companies from both countries has grown exceptionally here in Singapore. The city-state is home to the Asia-Pacific headquarters of many American tech giants, while their Chinese counterparts have significant operations here, too.\n\nFor global companies, Singapore seems to have it all: English and Chinese are both widely used as official languages here, the crime rate is one of the lowest in the world, and Changi Airport, one of the most efficient and connected in Asia, is less than 30 minutes from the city centre. And most importantly, Singapore has a highly educated talent pool.\n\nAs tensions between the world’s two biggest economies worsen, Singapore provides a space where companies from both sides can launch their Asia-Pacific and global expansions.\n\nBut geopolitical concerns are never far away. That can be seen in the case of Chinese fast fashion brand Shein, which has an operating company based in Singapore but is facing increasing pressure in the US.\n\nShein, the fast-growing and low-priced apparel brand popular among young shoppers, is eyeing an initial public offering in the US. However, a bipartisan group of American lawmakers has sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission urging it to block the IPO until the company can prove it is not using forced labour in China’s Xinjiang region, write Nikkei’s Rintaro Tobita and Tomoko Wakasugi.\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which took effect in the US last June, essentially bans imports of products made in Xinjiang.\n\nAlthough Shein has said it requires suppliers to buy cotton from approved regions to comply with the legislation, the bipartisan US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) recently released a report detailing allegations about forced labour as well as violation of intellectual property rights.\n\nTemu, an ecommerce platform run by PDD Holdings, operator of China’s popular Pinduoduo, has also come under American scrutiny. The company announced in a recent filing that PDD has relocated its headquarters from Shanghai to Dublin as it plans to ramp up its expansion outside China.\n\nBut regardless of where their headquarters may be located, US scrutiny of Chinese companies is unlikely to let up anytime soon.\n\nA top Chinese memory chipmaker is going forward with a listing in Shanghai that will fund significant expansion, after receiving confirmation from US chip toolmakers they can supply its new production lines, write the Financial Times’ Qianer Liu, Cheng Leng, Eleanor Olcott and Demetri Sevastopulo.\n\nMonths after Washington imposed a sweeping export ban over advanced chipmaking tools, ChangXin Memory Technologies has been told the equipment it needs will not be subject to US controls, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nCXMT, one of China’s biggest makers of DRam memory chips, has resumed expansion plans for foundries that it previously put on hold due to the US export controls. The new plants will manufacture less sophisticated chips for phones, servers and electric vehicles, bypassing the tightened restrictions over procuring advanced chip tools.\n\nTo fund this expansion, it plans an IPO on Shanghai’s tech-focused Star board and is in consultation with at least two possible underwriters for the listing, including Chinese bank CICC, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. CXMT and CICC did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDrivers in China have been quick to embrace electric vehicles, helped along by government incentives and plenty of models to choose from. But a crowded market has set the stage for a brutal price war, writes Nikkei Asia’s CK Tan.\n\nFrom around 200 EV makers today, some in the industry predict that less than a dozen will be left in a few years’ time as intense price pressure forces smaller players and those without deep-pocketed backers out of business.\n\nConsumer expectations of further price cuts risk exacerbating the pain for automakers. Shenzhen property agent Amy Liu, who is looking to trade in her five-year-old electric SUV, says she will shop around for a bit longer. “I will wait it out for the best deal.”\n\nWarren Buffett, chair and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, was full of enthusiasm for Japan at his investment company’s recent annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, writes Nikkei Asia chief business news correspondent Kenji Kawase.\n\nAt the event, Buffett was joined on stage by his longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, for a five-hour discussion covering investing, economics and geopolitics. The 92-year-old billionaire, known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” also touched on the move that surprised many observers late last year: selling the bulk of Berkshire’s stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world’s largest contract chipmaker.\n\nTSMC is “one of the best managed and most important companies in the world,” Buffett said, but the abrupt about-face was made “in light of the situation”, likely a reference to tensions across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nBuffett had much more to say about Berkshire’s holdings in Japan’s five trading houses: Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Mitsui and Co, Itochu and Marubeni. He lauded all five companies “really wonderful partners”, pointing to their “very, very substantial” operations, handsome dividend payments and share buybacks.\n\nHis appetite for Japan, it appears, is not yet sated. “We’re not done,” he told his audience in Omaha.\n\nWhile Buffett talked up Japan, the 99-year-old Munger had strong words for the world’s two biggest economies, saying he blames both the US and China for the current economic tensions. The situation was “wrongly created on both sides”, he said. “We are equally guilty of being stupid.”\n\n#techAsia is co-ordinated by Nikkei Asia’s Katherine Creel in Tokyo, with assistance from the FT tech desk in London.\n\nSign up here at Nikkei Asia to receive #techAsia each week.

    "body": "Singapore banks have reported falling wealth management fees despite posting record inflows of money and earnings, as a recent influx of wealthy individuals including Chinese family offices hold back from investing in capital markets.\n\nIncome from managing billions of dollars owned by rich clients has fallen among Singapore’s biggest lenders DBS, OCBC and UOB in the past year. While wealth management fees have fallen, the banks have posted higher than expected profits off the back of rising interest rates.\n\nOCBC, the city’s second-biggest lender, reported on Wednesday that non-interest income was down 11 per cent year on year to S$1bn ($753mn) owing to a drop in wealth management fees. That was even as the bank reported a 39 per cent rise in net profit year on year to deliver a record first quarter result of S$1.88bn.\n\nSingapore, known for its stability and low taxes, has been a haven for the ultra-wealthy during rising global geopolitical and financial uncertainty. Individuals from mainland China and Hong Kong and Taiwan have contributed to record capital inflows into the city-state in the past two years.\n\n“The wealthy Chinese and others that have come to Singapore since the pandemic are spending their money on Rolls-Royces or a luxury waterfront apartment — not with us,” said one investment manager based in the city-state.\n\nFund managers, private banks and other money managers say the boom in family offices and growth in the number of wealthy individuals parking their cash in Singapore have not translated into investment activity in private equity, hedge funds and equities.\n\n“A lot of wealth management fees come through trades that clients place with banks. In times of volatility they are a lot more cautious. Many are not increasing leverage and are instead paying down the amount they borrowed,” said Pramod Shenoi, head of financial research for Asia Pacific at CreditSights.\n\n“There was initially an expectation of double-digit fee income growth led by wealth management . . . But a lot of the money coming in is not going to the banks. Many family offices have their own infrastructure and hire their own investment advisers,” he added.\n\nUOB, one of Singapore’s top three banks, said in April that net fee and commission income slipped 4 per cent to S$552mn compared with a year earlier as a result of softer loan-related and wealth management fees.\n\nDBS last week said its wealth management fees, the largest component of fee income, plunged 11 per cent in the first three months of year.\n\nDBS also posted a record first-quarter profit of S$2.6bn thanks to high interest rates. Chief executive Piyush Gupta said there had been strong inflows of new money.\n\n“We delivered a record performance and benefited from safe-haven deposit inflows during a quarter marked by increased market volatility,” he said in a statement last week.\n\nUOB reported a record S$1.6bn in core net profit for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 74 per cent over the same period.\n\nBoth DBS and UOB said at their results presentation in April that wealth management fees were starting to rebound as investor sentiment improved.",

    "body": "Singapore’s big lenders have been breaking record after record. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation is the latest to join the trend for earnings leaps, reporting its best-ever quarterly profits. Billionaires are seeking a haven in the city-state amid geopolitical uncertainty. That will be a lasting trend.\n\nWith Hong Kong on the wane, Singapore is strengthening its credentials as an offshore centre. That means plentiful inflows for Singapore banks. Property is the preferred investment for incomers.\n\nSingapore has long been a favourite for wealthy mainland Chinese, who accounted for 31 per cent of all property purchases by foreigners last year. They like the city-state’s independence, the widespread use of Mandarin Chinese and the strong record of capital appreciation of local real estate.\n\nIn recent years, Singapore has also lured more investors from the US, Malaysia and India. Nearly 30 per cent of Singapore’s population are foreigners without permanent residency.\n\nOCBC, which is south-east Asia’s second-biggest bank, lifted profits 39 per cent to S$1.9bn ($1.4bn), beating expectations. Net interest income jumped 56 per cent. The net interest margin was an impressive 2.3 per cent, up from 1.55 per cent the previous year. OCBC has upgraded NIM guidance. Return on equity rose more than 4 percentage points to 14.7 per cent.\n\nLast week, larger rival DBS Group reported a 43 per cent jump in first-quarter profits. Last month, smaller peer United Overseas Bank posted a 74 per cent earnings surge.\n\nRents have risen nearly a third last year at the fastest rate in 15 years. The government recently increased the tax foreigners pay on residential purchases from 30 per cent to 60 per cent in an attempt to check rising prices.\n\nInflows of new money should benefit wealth management services which sprawl from the banks into niche funds and family offices. Local lenders already trade above tangible book value. They have scope to go higher, given Singapore’s financial momentum.\n\nThe Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

    "blurb": "The city-state draws both people and capital from Beijing, but looks to Washington for regional security",
    "date": "2023-04-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong recently managed what few other global leaders would be able or willing to do: travel to China and publicly praise a US-led Asian initiative.\n\n“Asia should always remain an open region,” Lee said at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan. “As Asian countries develop co-operation among ourselves, we should also cultivate our relations with the US, Europe and other parts of the world.”\n\nThat Lee commended the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework — a trade initiative intended to reassert US engagement in the region with an alternative to Beijing’s economic statecraft — at one of China’s largest annual international conferences pleased many American policymakers, said one US official based in Singapore who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nThe event underscored the level of comfort that Singapore, one of Washington’s most important non-treaty allies in Asia, has attained with its long-term partner in a new phase of heightened Sino-US competition. The city-state carefully balances its economic relationship with China and its reliance on the US for security.\n\nBut Singapore has become more active in deepening its defence ties with the US over the past several years, one of the only south-east Asian countries to do so aside from the Philippines, despite its friendly relations with Beijing and a recent influx of people and wealth from mainland China, risking tensions with its largest trading partner.\n\nIn March, the US Air Force-operated RQ-4 Global Hawk, a stealth aircraft known for its surveillance capabilities and capacity to transmit time-sensitive targeting details, was revealed to have been deployed on a short-term basis from Singapore’s Changi airport.\n\nThe previous month, Singapore announced that it would exercise an option to acquire eight more F-35 fighter jets from the US, increasing its order to 12.\n\n“Both of these actions sent a strong signal about how Singapore feels right now about its strong relationship with the US,” said a former diplomat in Singapore familiar with the government’s thinking. “Deploying Global Hawk in the backyard of the South China Sea? The optics of that send a message.”\n\nFor Singapore, which allows US forces to access its air and naval facilities on a rotational basis as part of a 1990 agreement, the strategic logic is straightforward. It believes an American presence in Asia — especially its military presence — is beneficial to its own interests and regional security.\n\nThe F-35 deal was particularly important, said experts, because other US allies in the region, including Japan, South Korea and Australia, had also purchased the stealth fighters. This would enable interoperability — where one country’s air force flies missions with partners that are similarly equipped.\n\n“By 2035, there will be an estimated 300 F-35s in the Indo-Pacific region, with the majority in Australia, Japan and South Korea,” said Nicholas Fang, director of security and global affairs at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. “In the event of a conflict, there is the possibility of a unified network of such aircraft from US allies operating in concert, and Singapore could potentially be a part of that.”\n\nJa Ian Chong, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said the strengthened ties meant that Singapore would be dependent on US military equipment and technology. “This is Singapore investing in the US system for a good decade or two,” he added. “It really locks [them] into that defence relationship.”\n\nResearch published this month by Australia’s Lowy Institute think-tank traced how the US-Singapore defence partnership has been upgraded since 2019, with increased arms procurements, more joint training and deployments of personnel and equipment.\n\nThe US Indo-Pacific Command boosted its personnel in Singapore by 12 per cent between 2018 and 2021, according to the report’s authors, while the city-state buys more arms equipment from the US than any other country in south-east Asia.\n\nLast year, Singapore, along with Japan and Australia, for the first time took part in Garuda Shield, an annual joint exercise between the US and Indonesia. In June, the US will send its largest delegation to attend the annual Shangri-La Dialogue — billed as Asia’s leading defence summit — since before the pandemic.\n\n“Unlike the rest of south-east Asia, Singapore is more active in its balancing,” said Susannah Patton, director of the south-east Asia programme for the Lowy Institute. “Rather than withholding its support or endorsement from a partner, it looks to actively make itself indispensable.”\n\nFor now, China has not challenged Singapore’s delicate balancing act. But Beijing is also seeking to boost its security relationship with Singapore and south-east Asia, including greater military engagement, raising the prospect of another front for tensions, according to policymakers and officials. This week, China held its first military drills with Singapore since 2021.\n\n“This potentially creates problems down the track if you rely heavily on US systems and equipment,” said one defence expert who has advised several Asian governments.\n\nSingapore is also grappling with ever-closer cultural ties to China. The city-state’s resident population is more than 70 per cent ethnic Chinese. These connections have grown with inflows of people and capital, with the financial hub a top destination for mainland citizens fleeing restrictive Covid-19 policies and President Xi Jinping’s regulatory crackdown on business.\n\nSingapore’s position has become more difficult as hostility between the US and China escalates, particularly over Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\n“There are several points of stress approaching . . . especially as [Singapore’s] economic dependence and cultural ties to China have grown considerably in the past few years,” said Chong.\n\n“The neutral approach works until it doesn’t. It is unclear what Singapore’s fallback position is when it doesn’t.”",

    "blurb": "City-state takes action to cool housing boom partly driven by mainland Chinese buyers",
    "date": "2023-04-2700:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore has doubled its tax on private property purchases by foreigners to 60 per cent in an unexpected move to cool a housing boom that has in part been driven by buyers from mainland China.\n\nForeigners who have secured permanent residency in Singapore will only pay a stamp duty of 5 per cent, but they will pay 30 per cent — up from 25 per cent — if they buy a second residential property. Entities or trusts purchasing any residential property will now pay a rate of 65 per cent, up from 35 per cent.\n\nSingapore’s minister for national development Desmond Lee called the increases “pre-emptive measures” to damp local and foreign investment demand during a renewed spike in interest. Singaporean citizens, who pay minimal stamp duty on house purchases, will now be prioritised, he said.\n\nForeign buyers account for a small proportion of overall property sales. Thursday’s move is the latest attempt by Singapore’s government to rein in property prices amid growing concern that locals are being priced out of the housing market and high prices could make Singapore less attractive as an international financial centre.\n\nThe demand for property in the Asian city-state, which attracts investors for its stability and low taxes, has made it an outlier compared with other global cities including London and New York, where house prices have fallen on the back of rising interest rates.\n\nThe government’s move comes ahead of first-quarter property data due to be released on Friday. Early estimates forecast foreign buyers comprised 7 per cent of purchases in the first three months of this year, up from 4.7 per cent in 2022.\n\nPrices of private homes in Singapore increased by 3.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, up from a 0.4 per cent increase in the previous quarter, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s flash estimates released this month. Last year, prices rose 8.6 per cent, on top of a 10.6 per cent rise in 2021.\n\nChinese buyers accounted for 25 per cent of foreign purchases of condos in Singapore in 2022, according to government data. People from mainland China have been the biggest group of foreign buyers in Singapore for more than a decade, though they still make up a small fraction of total private property sales.\n\nShares in Singapore property developers, including City Developments and UOL, were set for their worst trading day in more than two years on Thursday. Citigroup in a note called the latest measures “draconian” and said there would be a temporary “knee-jerk negative impact on residential developers”.\n\nProperty experts said the move might not have an immediate effect on the very wealthy.\n\n“I am not sure even this will affect the very top end of buyers, especially those that have become permanent residents from places like mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan,” said one luxury real estate agent with clients from China, who asked to remain anonymous because of sensitivities involved.\n\n“I was definitely caught off guard,” said Christine Sun, head of research and consultancy for real estate group OrangeTee & Tie, adding it felt like “more a freezing than a cooling” measure.\n\nAdditional reporting by William Langley in Hong Kong\n\nLetter in response to this report:\n\nSingapore doubles property stamp duty for foreigners to 60% / From Khaw Wei Kang, Macau",

    "body": "At least 80 Credit Suisse investors in Singapore are in talks to sue the Swiss government over its decision to write down $17bn of Credit Suisse bonds on the grounds it violated a free trade agreement.\n\nThe bondholders are preparing to argue that the move breached protections against unfair state actions under the Singapore-European Free Trade Association signed with Switzerland in 2003, according to law firm Wilmer Hale, which is in talks with investors.\n\nThe potential lawsuit in Singapore would open a new front in the legal battles against Switzerland for its decision to wipe out the bonds as part of the bank’s state-sponsored takeover by UBS.\n\nLaw firms WilmerHale and Engelin Teh Practice are in talks with a group of family offices and wealthy retail investors in the Asian city state whose additional tier 1 or AT1 bonds were written off as part of the deal.\n\nRisky AT1 debt is popular in the region among retail investors. AT1s are a class of debt designed to take losses when institutions run into trouble but are generally believed to rank ahead of equity on the balance sheet.\n\nThe investors so far had collectively invested close to $70mn in AT1s, enough to attract the interest of four global litigation funds, said two people familiar with the discussions, adding that the number of investors was likely to grow.\n\nThe Singapore discussions could also lead to similar actions by investors in other parts of Asia, where a large number of wealth managers, private banks and rich individuals had bought the Credit Suisse debt instruments.\n\nAt least $750mn of the bonds were denominated in Singapore dollars, 91 per cent of which came from Singapore and another 7 per cent from elsewhere in Asia.\n\nSwitzerland angered bond investors when the government used an emergency ordinance to write down the bonds to zero, even as it orchestrated a deal where UBS will pay $3.25bn to shareholders. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Pallas Partners are among the law firms representing US bondholders who intend to fight the decision.\n\nUnlike the US, Asian countries including Singapore, China, India, South Korea and Japan have unique protections under multilateral treaties designed to protect foreign investment, according to WilmerHale.\n\n“There are arguments that the Swiss government breached these protections by acting contrary to the investors’ legitimate expectations regarding the hierarchy of claims — that bond holders will rank higher than shareholders,” said Jonathan Lim, a partner at WilmerHale focusing on international arbitration.\n\nIn contrast with the US, where big funds such as Pimco and Legg Mason were long-term holders of AT1s, Asian investors are typically smaller individuals and enterprises. The Singapore investors’ holdings ranged from $200,000 to $12mn for some of the family offices.\n\nOther lawyers cautioned that a Singapore lawsuit was an “uphill battle” and played down the chances of the investors getting their money back.\n\n“I haven’t closely assessed the merits of this approach but I would say it will be a difficult argument to win,” said one international arbitration expert.\n\nOne investor, who runs a family healthcare business in Singapore, invested $500,000 of his savings in Credit Suisse AT1 bonds at the beginning of the year.\n\nHe wants the lawsuit to go ahead. “I’m not optimistic but it is better than doing nothing. I want a front-row seat to this debacle and hopefully I can learn something,” he said.\n\nA retired entrepreneur in Singapore said they wanted to participate in the potential legal action because they felt “completely misled” over the bonds after investing $700,000 in the AT1s.\n\n“I invested because this was a household brand name. Now I have nothing.”",

    "body": "One thing to start: Rupert Murdoch’s Fox has agreed to pay $787.5mn to settle a landmark defamation case in which it was accused of broadcasting false accusations of US election fraud, according to a lawyer for voting machine maker Dominion.\n\nIn today’s newsletter:\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve increased interest rates from 0 per cent to nearly 5 per cent, the move began to eat up the cash that leveraged companies and commercial property groups loaded up with floating rate debt generated.\n\nBut for many on Wall Street, the big surprise of 2023 is that higher base rates have caused a slow-motion banking crisis well before an expected wave of corporate distress emerged.\n\nBig banks have been steadily losing deposits for the past year as customers rerouted their cash to higher-yielding products such as money market funds. It has led to an existential issue for some large US regional lenders.\n\nAfter the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank exposed the pressure banks face as rates normalise, billions more in deposits fled smaller lenders, kicking off a high-stakes race on Wall Street to hoover up the extra liquidity. JPMorgan Chase led the pack with $37bn in new deposits in the first quarter, bringing total deposits to $2.38tn.\n\n“The number one, two or three things to watch this quarter are deposits, deposits, deposits,” Jason Goldberg, a research analyst at Barclays, told the FT earlier this month.\n\nIt’s not just regional lenders that have bled deposits. America’s largest brokerage Charles Schwab has been hit by a strategy of investing customer deposits in secure, long-dated bonds and mortgage-backed securities that have since lost billions in value.\n\nGQG, one of Schwab’s biggest investors disclosed this week that it had sold its entire $1.4bn stake as concerns over paper losses on its bond portfolios spiked last month.\n\nThough JPMorgan is pulling in cash during yet another crisis, its longtime boss Jamie Dimon isn’t getting too comfortable, warning investors on Friday that potential “storm clouds” are gathering as inflation threatens to tip the US into a recession.\n\nStill, he has more to celebrate than his Wall Street counterpart David Solomon, head of Goldman Sachs, who must unwind strategic mistakes and navigate the economic turmoil.\n\nSolomon has followed up an aggressive cost-cutting campaign with lacklustre earnings punctuated by an 18 per cent slump in the bank’s first-quarter profits because of poor fixed-income trading results.\n\nSolomon has also slapped a “for sale” sign on home improvement lender GreenSky just 13 months after he steered its purchase for $2.2bn. It’s another step in paring back Goldman’s consumer banking ambitions.\n\nGoldman’s latest collaboration with Apple has come at an opportune time, though, as US depositors explore greener pastures. On Monday, the duo launched a new savings account yielding 4.15 per cent a year, more than 10 times the national average rate.\n\nGoldman has a chance to succeed in its newest push for deposits, but it will be a zero sum outcome. The money will have fled a bank or brokerage elsewhere in the financial system, underscoring that the havoc of rising rates still hasn’t fully filtered through Wall Street.\n\nIn the latest sign that the pharmaceutical market is warming up, GSK has agreed to buy Canadian biotech Bellus Health for $2bn.\n\nBankers have been hoping that the diving valuations in the biotech sector, after a sell-off that started in 2021, would lead to a boom in M&A. Tempted by good deals, Big Pharma would seek drugs to restock pipelines.\n\nBut the past few months have shown that large drugmakers aren’t looking to scoop up undervalued assets. Rather, they are happy to pay a premium for companies with drugs that are in late-stage trials or already on the market.\n\nGSK paid a more than 100 per cent premium for Bellus. And earlier this week, New Jersey pharma titan Merck paid a 75 per cent premium on its $10.8bn deal to buy Prometheus Biosciences.\n\nThere’s a method to Merck’s madness. The company could lose exclusivity over its best-selling cancer drug five years from now, and making expensive dealmaking bets has become a critical survival mechanism for industry heavyweights, Lex notes.\n\nThe deal comes just a few weeks after Pfizer spent $43bn on SeaGen, a cancer treatments maker previously pursued by Merck.\n\nAnd while Pfizer only paid a 35 per cent premium to SeaGen’s previous Friday closing price, that’s just because the oncology-focused biotech had been in talks with buyers for several months. Pfizer’s price of $229 a share was far higher than Merck’s offer of $200 a share last summer, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nFlush with cash, pharma’s internal business development teams may be less interested in nabbing a bargain than ensuring their own job security, people familiar with the matter tell the FT’s Hannah Kuchler.\n\nSo instead of following the money, follow the clinical data: as assets get derisked, more bidding wars could ignite.\n\nThree times a year, executives from some of the world’s biggest private banks — including JPMorgan, UBS and Citigroup — sit down with regulators in Singapore to discuss the city-state’s booming industry of private wealth management.\n\nThe forum, known as the Private Banking Industry Group, has been meeting for more than a decade. But the context has changed significantly in recent years as the super-wealthy — many of them from China — have poured larger and larger sums into Singapore.\n\nThe city-state has been trying hard to establish itself as a hub for private wealth. One banker based in Singapore said inflows from China “are probably overrunning” the “best expectations of what was going to happen”, DD’s Kaye Wiggins and the FT’s Mercedes Ruehl and Leo Lewis report.\n\nThat growth has brought difficulties. Singapore is trying to tread a careful path as a neutral financial centre at a time of rising tension between Washington and Beijing. An influx of Chinese money risks sparking a domestic pushback, widening the income gap as rents soar.\n\nMultiple people who attended the meeting or were briefed on its contents told the FT that the Monetary Authority of Singapore gave a clear message: it wanted banks to avoid public discussion of the origins of the cash that has been flooding in.\n\nThat Singapore would send this message to private bankers, a group not known for high levels of transparency and disclosure about their work, is a sign of just how sensitive the issue has become.\n\nAfter the FT’s story came out, the MAS published a statement on its website saying it “has not issued any directive to banks — tacit or otherwise — to avoid discussing the origins of wealth inflows into Singapore”. Which means, presumably, we can look forward to detailed disclosures from now on.\n\nWealth for the win Andy Saperstein was a long-shot to replace Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman. But the wealth boss is a safer bet in a market that has humbled Wall Street’s risk-takers, Bloomberg reports.\n\nBalancing act Since George Osborne’s “twin peaks” regulation overhaul in 2013, the UK’s financial regulators have walked a political tightrope between risk and forging a post-Brexit future, the FT’s Laura Noonan writes.\n\nOld habits die hard Despite a clampdown on betting sponsorships, UK football’s gambling ties will be hard to shake, the FT reports.\n\nJamie Dimon to be questioned by Jes Staley’s counsel in Epstein case (FT)\n\nTHG boss says company will ‘double down’ on profits focus after annual loss widens (FT)\n\nHSBC accused by top investor of ‘exaggerating’ break-up risks (FT)\n\nShipping group CMA CGM in talks to buy Bolloré Logistics (FT)\n\nLiontrust among suitors for Zurich-listed asset manager GAM (Sky News)\n\nTrump Spac pays $15,000 a month for office in Caribbean home (FT)\n\nPension fund Calstrs braced for writedowns in $50bn property portfolio (FT)\n\nFormer NFL player to acquire $7bn ETF shop (FT)\n\n",

    "blurb": "Tacit directive from regulators comes as wealthy Chinese people funnel funds into city-state",
    "date": "2023-04-1400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore has asked the world’s biggest banks to avoid discussing the origins of the significant sums of money flowing into the city over the past year, as wealthy Chinese funnel billions into the Asian financial hub.\n\nThe tacit directive from the Monetary Authority of Singapore was given during a February 20 meeting of an industry group made up of bankers and regulators, according to multiple people who attended.\n\nThe flow from China into Singapore has become a politically sensitive issue domestically, and the MAS wants banks to keep public discussion of the phenomenon to a minimum, said three people with knowledge of the talks. China was not mentioned by name, but it was clear regulators were referring to the country, they added.\n\nThe influx of mainland Chinese money and people into Singapore comes as China’s President Xi Jinping has launched a regulatory assault on business and an anti-corruption crackdown. The city-state has plotted a careful path as a neutral financial centre at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, becoming a destination for the assets of many of China’s wealthiest families.\n\n“It was obvious that they [the MAS] were referring to China with all the press about family offices setting up here and mainlanders moving over, though they didn’t single out a particular country,” said one banker from an international bank.\n\nMembers of the Private Banking Industry Group include HSBC, Standard Chartered, UBS, BNP Paribas, JPMorgan and Citigroup, as well as local banks DBS and Bank of Singapore. It is jointly chaired by representatives of the MAS and UBS and meets three times a year.\n\nThe MAS, Singapore’s central bank, said that when banks reported the sources of their inflows, they should not single out any particular markets, according to another senior banker briefed on the discussion.\n\nThis banker summarised the MAS’s message as being that private banks should “just quietly do your job” because “you don’t want to antagonise”.\n\nThe MAS said the meeting in February noted that growth in fund flows into Singapore “has been driven by high net worth individuals from different regions”. The meeting also discussed “robust risk management controls to safeguard against money laundering and terrorism financing risks”, it added.\n\nOne banker said it was not the first time the MAS has used the forum to address large capital inflows from a particular market. In the past, booming Indonesian wealth — and the local scrutiny it attracted — concerned regulators.\n\n“They desperately want to be the regional hub of private banking, and the situation has kind of granted them that wish,” said the banker. “[The Chinese flows] are probably overrunning their best expectations of what was going to happen.”\n\nLawyers and industry groups estimate Singapore had 1,500 family offices by the end of last year, with a large chunk of them from China. The MAS said there were 700 family offices at the end of 2021, up from a handful in 2018.\n\nSingapore has been eager to use financial regulation and government policy to maximise the appeal of its financial services industry and attract wealth, said one private banker briefed by a colleague on the February 20 meeting.\n\nHowever, it is acutely aware of the potential for domestic pushback against the influx of Chinese money and how it could widen Singapore’s income gap, already a political pressure point given the rising cost of living and soaring rents.\n\n“The Chinese presence is being felt everywhere,” said one industry group executive in the asset management industry. “It is not just super yachts and luxury cars anymore, it is being percolated down to everyday people and it is a topic of conversation across all layers of Singapore society.\n\n“We haven’t been told explicitly not to talk about” China, the executive added, “but there is a sense in the financial services industry that talking about it publicly will not be welcomed”.",

    "body": "Good morning from New York.\n\nSadly, today’s Moral Money is the last issue I write as a contributor from Nikkei. It has been such an honour to cover the transformation of ESG investing in the Asia-Pacific region as it transitioned from being a latecomer in the field to a global growth engine. From next week, my New York-based Nikkei colleague, Kaori Yoshida, will be stepping into my shoes.\n\nBefore I sign off, I would like to share the top three things which surprised me during my stint with Moral Money:\n\nFirst, the speed at which the field of ESG investing has taken off has been astounding. The industry has evolved from a group of minor financial products to a $40tn behemoth.\n\nBut the backlash ballooned with equal pace. The word ESG leapt from presentations on Wall Street to people’s living rooms as commentators such as Fox News’ Tucker Carlson argued that ESG was a tool to spread liberal values and erase conservative ideals. During the US 2024 presidential campaign, I won’t be surprised if we observe some of the Republican candidates sparring over “anti-ESG” or “anti-woke” credentials.\n\nLastly, it’s worth noting how robust the sustainability movement remains despite this strong headwind. Many of my sources have told me that they’re continuing their efforts to decarbonise, even though they may speak less about ESG in public. Some companies said they would keep working on cleaning up their supply chains because it is what investors — as well as clients and consumers want. As one source in the finance industry told me: “Unfortunately, we have to live in the post-ESG era now. But it doesn’t mean our priority has changed.”\n\nThank you for sharing this amazing journey with me. I won’t say sayonara as I will keep covering the field for Nikkei. So, please stay in touch! You can reach me at shimizuishi_ny@nikkei.com.\n\nThe idea of unleashing the power of Asian investment to guide society to decarbonise was in its infancy when I started covering the region for the inaugural Moral Money in June 2019.\n\nBack then, the term “ESG” was still rare in Japan. Yet I thought that the nation’s capital was a strong contender to become a green finance hub. Historically, Japan is environmentally conscious as a small island country without massive natural resources. Corporations have a tradition of taking into account the interests of customers and the local community — rather than just shareholder returns.\n\nBack in 2019, many executives of large corporations were wearing rainbow-coloured badges, which celebrated the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, like a hot fashion item. And the country’s pension fund “whale” GPIF had Hiromichi Mizuno — one of the most influential figures for the global ESG movement at the time — as its chief investment officer.\n\nFour years later, however, Tokyo seems to be losing its pole position in the race to become the Asian capital of ESG investing.\n\nAs Hong Kong residents left their city en masse following the implementation of Beijing’s national security law and its zero-Covid policy, there was a chance for Tokyo to grab financial talent from one of its main rivals. But they didn’t head to Tokyo. Instead, Singapore became the preferred destination.\n\nA Hong Kong-based Japanese fund manager — who has seen many former colleagues relocate in the past three years — said that many people leaving Hong Kong disregarded Tokyo because the city lacks “the fundamental infrastructure that high-skilled global financial talents would like to keep”.\n\nForeigners can find Japanese culture difficult to integrate into seamlessly. English is not a common language, which can make things difficult if you don’t speak Japanese. Plus, tax codes are relatively unfavourable for high earners and financial businesses. The Japanese tax on financial gains hovers at about 20 per cent, while Singapore has no such levy. And while many expats enjoy having a nanny for their kids or maids at home in other Asian cities, such services are harder to afford in Japan.\n\nMichael Sheren, former adviser at the Bank of England and longtime advocate of sustainable finance, highlighted to Moral Money a few reasons why Singapore has emerged as a winner in green finance over other big financial service hubs such as Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai. For one, in Singapore there were clear efforts taking place between the domestic private and public sectors, said Sheren, who acts as president and chief strategy officer of Singapore-based fintech company, MetaVerse Green Exchange.\n\nFor example, Climate Impact X, a global exchange in high-quality carbon credits, was jointly established by financial institutions such as Singapore’s DBS Bank and Standard Chartered as well as Singapore Exchange and Temasek, the country’s state investor. Singapore’s government has also implemented clear guidelines around voluntary carbon markets — which would help to drive green finance activity, Sheren said.\n\nHe also noted that Ravi Menon, the managing director of Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state’s central bank, concurrently serves as chair of the Network for Greening the Financial System, which brings together more than 120 central banks to develop recommendations for central banks’ role in climate action. Last year, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero selected Singapore as a location for its Asian headquarters.\n\nBut some still believe that Tokyo has an advantage over Singapore.\n\nKeiichi Aritomo — executive director of FinCity.Tokyo, a partnership between the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and financial institutions to promote Tokyo as a global financial city — noted that it is not just a financial trade centre like Singapore, but a gateway to the world’s third-largest economy.\n\nAritomo argued that ESG investors in Tokyo have a chance to make a larger impact on green transformation — and collect bigger returns — compared to those in other Asian cities due to Japan’s extensive industry coverage, from high-tech manufacturing to agriculture. Aritomo also emphasised that Japan is fully democratic and politically stable.\n\nYet he acknowledged that Tokyo has some quirks that push foreign businesses away.\n\nDespite its reputation for high-tech gadgets, many business transactions in the country are still conducted in an analogue fashion rather than by digital tools. As a result, documents are often required to be submitted by mail — or by fax (do you remember that?).\n\n“We need to get rid of fax,” Aritomo told me. Trade transactions in Japan also involve too much paperwork and were unnecessarily complex, spanning a multitude of different regulators, he added.\n\nAsia is home to the world’s largest emitters, so intensifying competition among cities to become a green financial hub in the region is welcome news — even though the winner may not be my hometown. (Tamami Shimizuishi, Nikkei)\n\nYou might remember activist investor Carl Icahn’s high-profile but unsuccessful bid to stop McDonald’s use of gestation crates for female pigs last year.\n\nThe latest shareholder challenge to McDonald’s is about human health, rather than animal welfare, as scientists warn that eating burgers from cows fed a cocktail of antibiotics to promote rapid growth can build our resistance to life-saving drugs.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the fast-food giant will announce whether the ballot at its annual general meeting in May will include a proposal for it to comply with World Health Organization guidelines on reducing antibiotic use. Asset managers Amundi and LGIM, as well as Hesta, one of Australia’s largest pension funds, are behind the proposal.\n\nThere is a strong business case for tackling antibiotic and antiviral resistance. Drug-resistant illnesses could compromise the profitability of some healthcare business models, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services warned in a blog in March. “Humanity is in an arms race with pathogens that are increasingly outsmarting our current stock of weapons,” it wrote.\n\nAs the world’s largest buyer of beef, McDonald’s could lead the way in mitigating these risks, Kim Farrant, head of responsible investments at Hesta, told me. “When the efficacy of life-saving drugs [is] compromised, the entire economy suffers,” she said. “It’s important for our portfolio but also for our members.”\n\nMost of Hesta’s pension fund members work in healthcare. It says it now puts antibiotic resistance on a par with climate change and biodiversity loss as a systemic risk to strong and stable markets.\n\nBut two similar proposals it co-filed earlier this year at US food processing companies Hormel Foods and Tyson Foods failed to get majority support from shareholders. And despite ISS’s warning in March, the world’s largest proxy adviser recommended that shareholders vote against these two resolutions.\n\nISS’s own research points to a lack of focus of the issue — just 4 per cent of pharmaceutical companies to which it gives an ESG rating are developing antibiotic or antifungal treatments.\n\nAs activist shareholders experiment with new types of health-related proposals, Simon Rawson, deputy chief executive of ShareAction, told me the responsible investment charity focuses its health-related investor engagement on issues such as obesity, tobacco and alcohol use and air pollution, because these disproportionately affect lower-income communities.\n\nFrom antibiotic resistance to animal welfare and air pollution — it seems likely that health will stay a part of the ESG debate.

    "date": "2023-04-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Chinese businesses have had to face political tensions with the west, US sanctions that hit their revenues, and severe disruptions from mainland Covid lockdowns. But many have found a simple way to cope with all of this: set up a new home in Singapore.\n\nAs a city state of 5.5mn people in the heart of south-east Asia, with a majority ethnic Chinese population, Singapore has long been a popular destination for mainland investment. However, the flows of money, talent and expertise from China have accelerated since 2018, as geopolitics, decoupling supply chains and the pandemic forced a need for diversification.\n\nWhile its own market is small, neutral Singapore is regarded as a key hub from which to deploy capital into the rest of south-east Asia, home to 675mn people.\n\nThis has led about 500 Chinese companies to set up or redomicile in the city in the last calendar year, according to estimates by business groups. The influx has included family office funds, private equity firms and wealth managers. They have all brought expertise and talent from the world’s second-largest economy, ex­perts note, and an eagerness to invest in Singapore’s technology and start-up scene.\n\nSingapore is a “gateway” to south-east Asia and, as such, where many regional start-ups have their holding companies, says Nick Xiao, chief executive of Hywin International, the Hong Kong-based unit of China’s Hywin Wealth.\n\nChinese investors see massive potential in a region with a young, growing middle class where successful innovation and products from China can be replicated, he adds.\n\n“The financial infrastructure of Singapore has come together to make it the perfect launch pad for Chinese investors wanting to tap into this market,” Xiao says, referring to recent reforms to encourage more investment funds and family offices.\n\nThe benefits to the region’s technology scene are not only financial. Chinese exports include entrepreneurs and expertise — many of whom have gone on to start their own technology companies in south-east Asia.\n\nBut some start-ups and experts doubt whether Singapore can produce enough talent and sophisticated innovation to put it in the same league as tech-savvy countries, such as Israel.\n\n“There are a few hurdles for Singapore to be a world-class technology hub,” says the head of one private equity group with a presence in the city, who asks to remain anonymous because of the sensitivities involved. “The government needs to make it easier for companies to employ foreign tech talent because there is a tech skills and talent gap here,” the private equity chief explains. “I know a number of start-ups that are employing tech roles outside of Singapore because government rules around foreign visas have become so tight. That has a flow-on effect to the level of cutting edge technology that can be developed here.”\n\nSingapore has, however, climbed to second place in the city rankings for the FT/Statista survey of Asia-Pacific High-Growth Companies in 2023. Tokyo leads the city placings with 82 companies, followed by Singapore with 75, and Seoul with 60 groups on the list.\n\nChinese capital has helped foster a generation of start-ups in the region. Singapore-based Grab, the super app offering ride-hailing, delivery and financial services, has received backing from Chinese ride-hailing group Didi Chuxing, Hillhouse Capital, and China Investment Corporation. Both Indonesia’s Gojek and Singapore-based Sea, the parent of online commerce platform Shopee, had Tencent as a major backer.\n\nMany mainland investors have also backed Singapore-based venture capital funds, most of which invest across south-east Asia. Insignia Ventures Partners has a number of wealthy individuals and Chinese tech companies invested across its funds.\n\n“As much as south-east Asia start-ups take inspiration from China, there are many layers to the region that cannot be fully understood without a local ‘guide’ or partners,” says Yinglan Tan, Insignia founding managing partner. “This is where a lot of local investors or GPs [general partners] can step in.”\n\nA number of Chinese funds are expanding their Singapore presence as they scout for investment opportunities. Shunwei Capital, which is part owned by Xiaomi founder Lei Jun, is growing its Singapore presence, according to Linked­In. Shunwei did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSource Code Capital, another major Chinese venture player that was an early backer of TikTok owner ByteDance, now has a Singapore-based venture partner, LinkedIn also reveals.\n\nWealth managers are fuelling the growth. Hywin’s Xiao says the company is looking at investing in venture capital funds that invest in south-east Asia, or co-investing alongside the local group and paying them a fee for finding the opportunity.\n\nOthers argue that the far greater and long-lasting impact on Singapore comes from the export of business leaders from China.\n\nAccording to research by Asia Partners, a south-east Asia focused investment group, there are more than 13,000 people who graduated from Chinese universities working in south-east Asia tech, of which 557 are founders, co-founders or chief executives. Most — 68 per cent — live in Singapore.\n\nSCI Ecommerce, a Singapore-based group ranked number 29 on this year’s list, was founded in 2014 by two former employees of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba.\n\nSCI — short for Singapore, China, Indonesia — helps multi­national companies, such as Unilever or Nestlé, set up and manage online stores in south-east Asia and China.\n\nGeopolitical tensions and the decoupling of China from the west has made south-east Asia more crucial for investors seeking diversification. As the US and Europe grow increasingly hostile to Chinese companies and money, south-east Asia is one of the few regionals globally that welcomes investment from the mainland.\n\nBut others question whether the capital inflows and expertise have been enough to put Singapore on the global map, with many investors still focused on short-term returns.\n\n“Creating world-leading technology and exporting or selling that as a product, globally, takes time and Singapore has not got to that point yet,” says Ravi Chidambaram, chief executive and co-founder of Rimm, a Singapore-based software as a service (SaaS) platform for sustainability management.\n\n“There are two ways for a tech company to scale: leverage the size of the market or build world-class intellectual property. As a Singapore tech company, yes, you do benefit from proximity to south-east Asia, but not from the massive tech and data science expertise needed to create that world-class IP. To build that type of ecosystem, you need more patient capital and a more liberal labour regime.”",

    "body": "In 2020, the pandemic halted travel and shut borders. But at the same time, two of Asia’s biggest financial hubs saw an opportunity to shift the global centre of gravity for hedge funds and the world’s wealthiest families.\n\nSingapore established the “variable capital company”, a fund structure that allows a wide range of potential users to shelter large pools of capital in discreet, lightly taxed wrappers domiciled in a well-regulated financial centre. Hong Kong made enhancements to the “open-ended fund company”, a similar structure it had established two years earlier.\n\nThe vehicles are a direct challenge to existing offshore centres such as the British Virgin Islands, Mauritius and the Cayman Islands, and their advocates predict they could herald big changes in the way money is managed.\n\n“We see this as the start of a massive shake-up of asset management, of family offices and the whole flow of capital,” says a Singapore-based partner of one UK law firm involved in setting up the new structures in both cities. “This sets the path for [HK and Singapore] to be the heart of a new hybrid between family offices and hedge funds.”\n\nInvestor take-up, particularly in Singapore, has been rapid. The bankers, fund managers and lawyers involved in setting them up say their impact could be far more widespread and disruptive than previously imagined, drawing assets and expertise into the region. To them, the innovations represent exactly the kind of regulatory boldness Asia needs.\n\n“Singapore has always been the poorer cousin compared with the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands and even places like Mauritius,” says Ryan Lin, a lawyer at Bayfront Law, who describes the new structure as “a game changer”.\n\n“[The VCC] came just as Singapore became increasingly popular as a wealth and fund management hub . . . it was extremely well-timed”.\n\nThe new vehicles represent a direct challenge to traditional offshore finance centres whose success has been built on privacy and low taxes and whose economies are heavily dependent on the revenue generated by financial services.\n\nOthers fear they will create a fertile space for money laundering and tax avoidance. Maíra Martini, a research and policy expert at campaign group Transparency International, says the risk with vehicles such as OFCs and VCCs is that they “usually function like a black box” and “can be very attractive to the corrupt and other criminals”.\n\nHong Kong spotted its opportunity in the wake of the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers leaks, which in 2016 and 2017 sparked hundreds of news stories worldwide about the use, and abuse, of offshore funds in the Caribbean.\n\nThe stories made some institutions, especially public pension funds, more cautious about the reputational risks of investing in private equity and hedge funds domiciled in places such as the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. Investors were looking for alternatives because the public had started to “think that people only put money into the Caymans to hide something”, says a Hong Kong-based financial adviser.\n\nIn 2018, the territory’s regulators introduced its alternative, the OFC, which aimed to “enrich the choice of investment vehicles and facilitate the distribution of Hong Kong funds internationally”.\n\nOFCs are corporate fund vehicles that are domiciled in Hong Kong and whose units can be offered to the public or held privately. The investments within them must be managed by an entity licensed as an asset manager in Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to the adviser, who has worked on OFCs, the territory “was trying to capitalise on this trend” as well as attract lucrative business and help solidify its position as a global financial hub.\n\nSingaporean authorities, frustrated at the tendency of local fund managers to register investment vehicles offshore rather than in Singapore itself, launched the rival VCC in 2020. The city-state made it easier for overseas and domestic entities to register an investment vehicle in Singapore provided they had a local entity to manage it.\n\nDespite the “variable” moniker, VCCs can also have fixed capital, allowing them to cater to a diverse range of potential users including mutual fund groups, hedge funds, private equity, real estate firms and managers of family wealth.\n\nThe single locally incorporated structure can hold a pool of assets and multiple sub-funds, cutting down on costs. It is also covered by more than 70 double taxation agreements, making it less likely that the assets within it will be taxed twice over.\n\nAccording to one lawyer who has established the vehicles, a “big differentiator” of VCCs compared with traditional structures is that they allow for easy dividend payouts to shareholders. “In a conventional entity, if you start paying dividends out of capital not out of profits, the regulators will be all over you.”\n\nIn both Hong Kong and Singapore, privacy is another, perhaps even bigger, draw: the names of shareholders are not made public. “That’s very important because if I was a shareholder and had money in multiple VCCs, I wouldn’t want people to know where I’d invested”, the lawyer adds.\n\nMatthias Feldmann, a senior investment management partner at Clifford Chance based in Hong Kong and Singapore, points out that running costs are relatively modest. “A VCC is less expensive to operate once set up than an offshore fund vehicle . . . that is one of the key revenue streams of the government.”\n\nFor both financial centres, longstanding rivals within Asia, there were clear motivations for establishing the vehicles.\n\nHong Kong had an obvious target market: mainland Chinese investors and institutions, some of whom are drawn to the territory for its “familiarity and proximity”, says Sally Wong, chief executive of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association.\n\nOFCs can also use so-called connect schemes that allow mainland and Hong Kong investors to buy into exchange traded funds and wealth management products in each other’s markets.\n\nSingapore’s ambition was more subtly aggressive: to comprehensively shed its reputation for sleepiness and to position itself, through regulatory innovation and reputational risk-taking, as the region’s new alpha predator.\n\nThe speedier take-up of VCCs in the city-state is a sign, say lawyers, of how successfully Singapore has managed to position itself as the “not China” option for both Chinese money — whether held inside or outside the People’s Republic — and other cash. Its safe-haven credentials have strengthened as relations between the US and China have deteriorated.\n\nBoth Hong Kong and Singapore introduced generous incentives to encourage registration of the new vehicles, cementing in the minds of investors the idea that it is now government policy to encourage their proliferation.\n\n“The government is committed to developing Hong Kong not only as a fund distribution hub, but a fund domicile hub. This vehicle [OFC] is part of that package. It’s a strategic objective,” says Wong.\n\nHong Kong’s response to the launch — and rapid early take-up — of VCCs was to tweak the structure of the OFC to align it more closely with its south-east Asian rival. In 2021, the Securities and Futures Commission announced the government would pay 70 per cent of all fees to lawyers, accountants and other professional advisers engaged to establish OFC structures up to a value of HK$1mn (US$128,000).\n\nThat is more generous than Singapore’s subsidy of S$30,000 (US$23,000), but the Lion City also offers employment passes to senior managers and owners of the funds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the managers of more than a dozen funds say they either recently completed or were in the middle of establishing an OFC.\n\n“It’s not that we have a fixed idea yet of what might be coming under this umbrella,” says one fund manager who set up an OFC in January. “We just want to be ready to say ‘yes’ if, say, a Chinese tycoon calls us and says they want to put some capital into this kind of structure.”\n\nBut Hong Kong still lags behind its rival: 40 OFCs were set up in 2021 and 64 in 2022, a leap from just eight registered in the first two years but still far below Singapore’s numbers.\n\nPart of the reason for this is the long shadow cast by an increasingly autocratic China. Professionals advising on the structure in Hong Kong say privately that one thing limiting the scheme’s take-up is that many Chinese investors prefer to put their money in Singapore, which they regard as being further from Beijing’s reach.\n\n“That’s the problem we [Hong Kong] face: it’s not seen as being truly offshore,” says one adviser.\n\nFor Singapore, the rush to establish the new structures has been especially pronounced. “Prior to 2020, the vast majority of Singaporean managers had their funds in offshore jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands, Mauritius or Luxembourg. Now the tables have turned,” says Mahip Gupta, a partner at Singapore-based Dhruva Advisors.\n\n“Since the variable capital company structure was introduced, most have chosen Singapore as their fund domiciliation hub. Even new fund manager applications have significantly accelerated here.” Dhruva has set up 65 VCCs, and about a third shifted from other jurisdictions, according to Gupta. “A mass onshoring of funds is taking hold,” he adds.\n\nThere were 872 VCCs registered in the city-state as of February, according to government data. That helped drive a record S$448bn in total asset management inflows during 2021, 15.7 per cent higher than the previous year, according to the most recent data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the island nation’s central bank and financial regulator.\n\nThe number of licensed and registered fund management companies in Singapore increased 15 per cent year on year — by 146 — to 1,108 in 2021, the most recent data available.\n\n“The pace of growth surprised even the MAS,” says one hedge fund manager. “They had to add more people to meet the demand.”\n\nExperts disagree on exactly who is using the vehicles. “For large international managers or for institutional managers targeting international investors, the VCC is not yet that common,” says Feldmann.\n\nA hedge fund executive whose firm has used the structures says the incentives offered by both centres do little to attract large blue-chip investors. “The big guys don’t care about these small subsidies . . . It’s pocket change to them.”\n\nBut Anne Yeo, head of funds and investment management for Rajah & Tann, says VCCs have come a long way since their inception in 2020. “In the past 12 months, we have observed a gradual shift in terms of the VCC being invested into by worldwide global investors.\n\n“My sense of it is that VCCs serve a complementary role to Cayman or other fund structures,” she says. “We live in a complex world. There is no single fund structure that is just domiciled in one jurisdiction.”\n\nSingapore’s VCCs have also been helped by the rapid expansion of another piece of its asset management industry: family offices. Large amounts of family wealth shifted to the city-state during the pandemic, especially from mainland China, outpacing arguably even VCCs in terms of growth.\n\nBecause they do not manage third-party funds, single family offices are not regulated by the MAS in Singapore and lawyers say they have been moving into the VCC space. The effect is the creation of an ecosystem pulling in capital from other parts of the world.\n\n“The area where VCCs and family [wealth] overlap . . . is where single family offices decide there is an intention to take on external money and they start using a VCC structure,” says Vikna Rajah, a partner specialising in tax and trust for private clients at Rajah & Tann. The move requires them to become regulated fund managers, but it is adding to the boom in numbers, he adds.\n\nThe lure of the new structures, and of the capital expected to flow into them, is also beginning to trigger a movement of financial expertise. Singapore requires VCCs to have a fund manager, responsible for due diligence and anti-money laundering controls, based in the city-state. “That’s very smart,” the hedge fund executive says. “It’s going to create a lot of jobs for lawyers, accountants and auditors.”\n\nInvestment banks and long-only pension funds in Singapore and Hong Kong have reported a steady recent outflow of both junior and experienced people to family offices or firms involved with the newly established structures in preparation for a flood of new capital.\n\nAt one level, say lawyers, the similarity of the two structures, and the long rivalry between Hong Kong and Singapore for the title of prime Asian financial hub, make the VCC and OFC structures look like weapons in a battle between the two. In reality, they argue, this is about a much bigger proposition to global funds: establishing the two centres as a new and improved offshore destination.\n\nBut by positioning themselves as rivals to centres such as the Cayman Islands, both Hong Kong and Singapore are entering tricky territory. They are trying to lure away the best bits of the Caribbean islands’ lucrative business without also risking the public backlash they have faced for facilitating tax avoidance.\n\nThe two cities must also avoid attracting capital from sanctioned groups, money launderers and others who might be drawn to the lack of public disclosure about the funds’ shareholders.\n\n“Legitimate funds could be mixed with dirty money and used to invest across different sectors,” says Martini at Transparency International. That can make “it difficult for authorities to trace potentially stolen funds . . . To mitigate the risks of these structures being used for money laundering, transparency and regulation of fund managers are key”.\n\nBoth territories say they have put in place such measures. King Au, executive director of Hong Kong’s Financial Services Development Council, an advisory body set up by the Hong Kong government, acknowledges that OFCs could have investors from the US and Europe, potentially including Russia.\n\n“Therefore the fund managers or the banks who distribute the products have to, [through] the regulatory obligations, screen out these unwanted clients or money,” he says.\n\nThat task falls to executives at the groups managing the funds, both in Hong Kong and Singapore. One such individual says “reams” of paperwork and due diligence checks have been required; another points out he could be spot-checked by regulators at any time and held personally liable for any wrongdoing.\n\nSome companies may be better than others at screening their investors, says the hedge fund executive — or be more “willing to take a risk”. But he agrees that bringing the checks onshore is “the right thing”.\n\n“To me the point is they’re trying to make it a real jurisdiction from the start.”",

    "body": "Hong Kong-based asset manager Anatole is preparing to shift a key part of its business to Singapore, after telling investors it had significantly cut its exposure to China.\n\nThe firm, which made its name through outsized bets on China’s growth, is opening an office in the city-state and may move key functions and decision-making there, said three people familiar with the discussions.\n\nMany Asia-based hedge fund managers were left nursing large losses following a years-long regulatory assault by Chinese president Xi Jinping on multiple sectors from technology to property.\n\nProximity to the mainland through a Hong Kong base has become less crucial for managers such as Anatole as they diversify into fast-growing south-east Asia, home to 655mn people and featuring Singapore as a regional financial hub.\n\nAnatole may keep a smaller presence in Hong Kong, in part to try to avoid falling out of favour in China where it still has its largest exposure, said one of the people.\n\n“The nervous system is likely going to be in Singapore,” said another person briefed on the negotiations, though they added that the decision had not been finalised and the situation could change. The company registered in Singapore in February, according to the city’s accounting authority records.\n\nGary Lee, Anatole’s chief operating officer, confirmed the group was opening a Singapore office. He said the office would be an “outpost”, adding that he remained “bullish on the China recovery”.\n\nLee declined to say how staff would be split between the two locations, whether he and founding partner George Yang would move to Singapore and whether there would be lay-offs in Hong Kong.\n\n“We will maintain the resources we see fit to fully utilise the potential of the investment opportunity,” Lee told the Financial Times.\n\nSince its inception in 2016, Anatole had focused on long-term investments in Chinese companies and its fund manages about $2bn, according to Bloomberg. However, last year Yang, Anatole’s chief investment officer, said it was considering fresh “hunting grounds”.\n\nAnatole had told investors then that its flagship hedge fund had incurred large losses after misjudging the world’s second-largest economy. Chinese stocks plunged in 2022 as China’s economy ground to a halt during the coronavirus pandemic and after the central government launched a regulatory crackdown on the internet, property and education sectors.\n\nSingapore is rivalling Hong Kong as a financial centre in Asia and has benefited from the latter suffering closed borders during the height of the pandemic. Geopolitical tensions have also increased the city-state’s attraction as a neutral financial outpost and haven for global capital — including from China.\n\nWhile a number of financiers and law firms have added employees and expanded their offices in the city-state, Singapore has lagged behind in capturing more hedge fund business.\n\n“Singapore is typically where you manage money, Hong Kong is where you make money. That is slowly changing,” said one financier.",

    "body": "The world is not short of artists at work on sprawling and multifarious projects, but even in that category Shubigi Rao stands out. Since 2014, the Mumbai-born, Singapore-based artist has been pursuing Pulp: A Short Biography of the Banished Book, a constellation of films, drawings, photos and a projected five books. The project centres on the precarity of literature and language around the world — the threats to the knowledge and communities that they represent — and reflects heartening efforts towards their preservation. Rao had planned to get it all done in a decade, but the pandemic delayed that. She is now just over midway through and intends to finish in 2026.\n\nPulp is “massive because I don’t know when to stop, frankly”, Rao says from her home in Singapore. “A lot of people think I have ambition. It’s not — ” She stops, a rare pause in her rapid delivery. “My ideas are always immense. And I just, you know, I just do them.”\n\nIt is the evening of her 48th birthday, but Rao has only recently woken up. She spent the previous night working, and there is ink on her fingers from finishing a piece that will be in the Encounters section of Art Basel Hong Kong (March 23-25). Titled “The River of Ink II”, it consists of 300 books that she has written in and drawn in, and drowned in ink, and it alludes to the story that the Tigris turned black in 1258 when the invading Mongol army threw the contents of Baghdad’s library into its waters. Rao holds up a few of the midnight-coloured volumes. One has the word “confetti” on its cover. “When you burn books,” she says, “the ashes that rain down, I call it confetti at a fascist parade.” She opens another to reveal a poetic sentence in silver: “Forgetting is the inevitable result of all human experience.”\n\nYou could see Pulp as a bulwark against that process. Rao’s latest volume, Pulp III, and a related film, Talking Leaves, record her interviews with far-flung librarians, activists, archivists and cultural guardians, such as a Singaporean writer who learned the endangered Kristang language and a Bosnian firefighter who battled the devastating 1992 blaze at the National Library in Sarajevo. Representing Singapore at last year’s Venice Biennale, Rao offered free copies of the book and screened the film. The art dealer Fabio Rossi stopped by and was enchanted. She is “so full of interesting things, things that I am interested in, too”, he says. “Books, literature, censorship, destruction.” From March 18, his Rossi & Rossi gallery in Hong Kong will stage a survey of her art, an opportunity to take stock of one of today’s most freewheeling art careers.\n\nBorn in 1975 in Mumbai, Rao grew up in Darjeeling, then New Delhi, where thieves ransacked a library that her environmentalist mother and civil-servant father had assembled. In the mid-1980s, they moved with their three children to Kaladhungi, an area in the Himalayas rich with wildlife. “We were never harmed by a single thing, but we were shot at by poachers,” Rao says. “Poachers also tried to set fire to our land because my parents’ idea of an outing was to take us in the jeep and chase down poachers.” They lived in a tent, then a hut, sans running water.\n\nThe historical and the personal regularly commingle in Rao’s practice, just as art has been intertwined with her life from early on. She was bullied at school, and “it was difficult at home”, she says, but she found solace in reading. “Growing up in India as a woman is — it’s not advisable, at least not for someone like me, who didn’t have the defence mechanisms in place,” she says. When it was time for college, she opted to study English via correspondence, travelling India on a motorcycle, disguised as a boy — “a lot of adventures, instead of sitting in class”, she says.\n\nThat disguise presaged her first big project, which she began after moving to Singapore about 20 years ago and deciding to go to art school: a decade of presenting material that she attributed to a man, S Raoul. He was a satire of an obscurantist scholar and his pursuits included creating an immortal jellyfish and inventing a device to prove that contemporary art can induce mental derangement. In this feminist provocation, Rao billed herself as “his protégé, his confidante, his collaborator”. Regrettably, Rao’s first “River of Ink” (2008) installation, which had 100 books, led to his death. “He tripped over this and broke his neck,” she says cheerfully.\n\nNow operating fully under her own name, Rao has become an in-demand figure from her base in Singapore. (Asked about the city-state’s own history of censorship, she says that she addresses it in “subterranean ways”, while contending that “there are far more books banned in certain states in the USA, for instance”.) She will have a solo show at the Rockbund Art Museum in Shanghai in November and late last year she curated India’s Kochi-Muziris Biennale, which was marked by serious logistical issues and financial shortfalls, leading its president to apologise. (Rao is hesitant to comment — “I’m still too close to it, and things are still not OK” — but says she is proud of the show and moved by how artists in India rallied to assist with the beleaguered installation process.)\n\nRao has a few more years left of Pulp, but she already has an idea for another decade-long endeavour, she says. What propels her? While discussing her childhood, she says that “over the years, I accumulated an immense amount of anger. And this anger and rage is very vital and very important. I think it’s an incredibly powerful force.” Some of her S Raoul work has a darkly comic bite, but in Pulp that force yields a moral clarity that is potent yet understated. Her vision is expansive, yes, but this is fundamentally intimate art, focused on championing people who are doing crucial work or simply displaying the majesty of nature.\n\nWhen asked about what she aims to accomplish through Pulp, Rao is quick to say that it takes at least 100 or 150 years for movements to create real change. But then she offers a few thoughts. “I hope enough people understand that the softer, quieter things are really important,” she says, “and much more powerful and enduring than the bombast and spectacle and the noise. That’s my approach to art-making, as well: less spectacle, and perhaps more thoughtfulness.”\n\nMarch 18-May 15, rossirossi.com",

The local elite seems a bit too sure that Manhattan is, and always will be, the gravitational centre of the cultural universe, or that the city is better off — as a professor recently put it to me — without all the “rich douchebags migrating to Miami”.\n\nBut complacency this deep could undo even the world’s greatest city, especially now. The pandemic has shown that remote offices can work full time, making it easier for anyone to relocate and magnifying what I call the cracked mirror effect. Cracks in New York — high taxes, surging crime, simmering anti-capitalist hostility — are reflected in the flight to no taxes and a warm welcome in Miami.A similar effect is visible in Moscow, where a heavy-handed Kremlin and world reaction to the war in Ukraine are chasing rich Russians out. Instead they are opting for more hospitable options, including Dubai. Meanwhile, regulatory pressure from Beijing is driving tycoons to buy second homes in Singapore.Millionaire populations dropped by 12 per cent last year in New York, 14 per cent in Hong Kong, and 15 per cent in Moscow. Dubai, Singapore and Miami are deliberately exploiting this migration by opening their doors to capitalists. These global cities rank among the most appealing to millionaire migrants — and make up the top three among luxury property markets where prices are expected to rise fastest this year.\n\nOn recent visits, I found all of them gaining momentum as people-magnets. Easy lifestyles smoothed by warm climes and efficient governments are drawing migrants from all over; they, in turn, are attracting new restaurants, swanky malls and art festivals.Singapore is the most established of the three: the millionaire population of 250,000 is much larger than those of Dubai or Miami and therefore naturally grows more slowly. Yet here, too, the energy is palpable. Recently, Singapore opened an agency to welcome family wealth management firms. The inflow was so overwhelming that the city is getting more selective about who qualifies for tax incentives. The local joke is that $500mn is the new $100mn, the sum required to get the welcome mat. Driving around I was struck by displays of wealth new to the usually sober city — one mansion had eight red Ferraris out front.Dubai now offers “golden visas” that allow the wealthy to buy property and stay. This is drawing in migrants not only from Russia but from across South Asia and the Middle East. A real estate boom is in full swing, driven by eight-figure purchases. Eighty per cent of transactions are made in cash, making the property market more stable than in past bubbles.\n\nDubai still values Guinness World Records as much as high culture: witness the colossus of the new Atlantis the Royal, a boutique hotel but massively scaled up to nearly 800 rooms and 17 restaurants, many run by world-famous chefs. It’s easier to find a great meal there than on the Upper West Side.Miami, once a quintessentially “sunny place for shady people”, has also achieved critical mass as a richly interesting city. People move here to avoid taxes, sure, but also to meet their fellow transplants, do deals in the growing financial district, walk the white sands and shop in the new design district — the first purpose-built luxury shopping neighbourhood in America.Increasingly, unabashedly capitalist cities are finding one another. Business class on the new Miami-Dubai flight is full every day, I was told, forging a direct link between American entrepreneurs and Middle Eastern oil wealth. Many other countries want to emulate Dubai’s success, including Zimbabwe, which hopes to remake Victoria Falls as a similar hub.Manhattanites who say good riddance to the “rich douchebags” might consider the Curley Effect, named after Boston mayor James Curley. By the time his fourth term ended in 1950, Curley had deliberately driven most of the rich “Anglo-Saxons” out of his city through incendiary rhetoric and bias. The effect was to deepen its early 20th-century stagnation.New York is not Boston circa 1950, but the exodus is a bad sign. For years, the state has been bleeding migrants to Florida, where the population is now slightly larger but the state government spends half as much — and the economy grows twice as fast. In 2022, for the first time, Florida had more non-farm jobs than New York.The migration of jobs and capital are leading indicators of development and of decline. Global cities hostile to wealth will end up sabotaging their own economic prospects to the benefit of more welcoming rivals such as Miami, Dubai and Singapore.",

The idea was to secure their commitment while protecting MPs from influence peddling by the private sector. Singapore’s current prime minister Lee Hsien Loong — Lee’s son — receives S$2.2mn ($1.6mn) annually, four times what the US president earns. The benchmark level of a minister’s annual income is S$1.1mn, according to government data, much higher than what politicians earn in countries such as the UK.\n\nBut their state salary is only part of Singaporean MPs’ income — many have outside roles, including “full-time” executive jobs at companies.\n\nNow fresh questions over the transparency of such roles have been raised after one of the country’s biggest technology companies appointed an MP to an influential position before backtracking.\n\nThe New York-listed Grab is a ride-hailing, food delivery and financial services group that has grown rapidly to have a dominant presence in the city through its “super app”. Its signature green and white logo is everywhere in the Lion City.\n\nTin Pei Ling from the ruling People’s Action party was appointed as head of public policy for Grab. As chair of the Parliamentary Committee for Communications and Information, she is potentially privy to information that may benefit Grab as well as influence regulatory affairs. Grab is facing regulation that would affect its business, for instance around the rights of gig economy workers.\n\nThere is no suggestion Tin or Grab intended the company to reap benefits it might not have otherwise. And taking a second job as an MP is permitted under Singapore law. The problem was the potential for conflicts of interest to arise.\n\nThe company itself has acknowledged such risks. “Much thought and care was given to address any potential conflict of interest that may arise when Pei Ling was hired,” Grab said when, in response to a public outcry, it moved Tin to a different role at the tech company in business development.\n\n“The discourse has led us to pause and reflect on how we can create an environment where Pei Ling can serve effectively in both her roles as an MP as well as representing Grab. We acknowledge that this is difficult if the intent behind every action or position she takes in the future is doubted or called into question.”\n\nTin’s salary was not disclosed. That is not unusual in Singapore. Finding such information — even the roles MPs hold — can be challenging. Unlike in the UK or US, there is no list of politicians’ financial interests. MPs are only required to disclose to the prime minister in confidence their business and professional interests and any other fees they receive.\n\nSuch an approach seems an anomaly in transparency to some. Michael Barr, an associate professor in international relations at Flinders University, says: “One of the most extraordinary things about Singapore politicians is how thoroughly they manage to keep their business interests under wraps.”\n\nMak Yuen Teen at the National University of Singapore believes there is an unhealthy blurring of the lines between government and business in the democratic city-state. As such, a public register of financial interests for MPs would be a “good idea”.\n\nSingapore still has a strong reputation in governance. While not immune to corruption or scandals, it ranks highly globally as a clean place for business. Last year, it scored 83 out of 100 on a widely used corruption index by the global group Transparency International, beaten only by Denmark, Finland, New Zealand and Norway.\n\nThe next review of Singapore’s public sector salaries, held every five years, is set for this year. At a time of soaring costs for citizens, the salaries of MPs and their roles in the private sector may draw more attention than they have in the past. New leadership and elections are also on the horizon and the PAP is facing declining popularity, especially among younger voters.\n\nIn such an environment, some argue more transparency on MPs and their outside pay might build confidence. “I’m not sure statements like the ‘ultimate safeguard is still MPs’ own conscience and judgment’ really cut it any more,” says David Black, the founder of Blackbox, a Singapore research firm.\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com\n\nThis article has been amended to remove an incorrect reference to the size of MP salaries in the penultimate paragraph.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nAn ‘incomplete picture’ of Singapore MPs’ interests / From TK Lim, Singapore High Commissioner, London SW1, UK",

    "body": "Hong Kong has lost ground to regional rival Singapore, according to a Financial Times analysis of real estate prices, air traffic and other indicators, underlining the challenge the Chinese territory faces as it reopens to the world after years of pandemic controls.\n\nIn recent weeks, John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief executive, has launched a campaign to convince the world that despite Covid-19 and a brutal security crackdown, the Chinese territory is not only open for business but remains Asia’s premier financial centre.\n\nYet the data demonstrates Hong Kong paid a price for its tough pandemic restrictions and quarantines, while Singapore made gains.\n\n“The trajectory for Singapore to become Asia’s finance hub . . . that takes time. It won’t happen in a year. But if I was the Singapore government, I would be very happy with where things are headed,” said Michael Marquardt, Asia chief executive of IQ-EQ, an investor services firm.\n\nHong Kong’s regional importance has been entrenched by its location on mainland China’s doorstep. The city has only just reopened to tourists after three years in which many international airlines stopped their services.\n\nIn contrast, Singapore was one of the first countries in Asia to reopen its borders during the pandemic. Last year, Hong Kong lost its position as the region’s busiest airport to Singapore, according to Sobie Aviation.\n\nMore aircraft have arrived in Singapore than in Hong Kong every month since January 2022, flight statistics show. Arrivals in Singapore have now reached 70 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, while those in Hong Kong are just over half of what they were before the pandemic.\n\nDespite the reopening, severe labour shortages in Hong Kong are preventing the full return of routes. Qantas has delayed the start of their Hong Kong to Melbourne service to the middle of the year.\n\n“The airport is much busier but it’s still at a fraction [of before Covid-19],” said Kristian Odebjer, chair of the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. “There are serious bottlenecks in terms of ground staff. I think that is holding back Hong Kong.”\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping’s clampdown on technology entrepreneurs has heightened Singapore’s attraction as a destination for wealthy elites — and their funds.\n\nSince mid-2021, Singapore’s foreign currency deposits have increased by more than $100bn, an FT analysis of bank data shows, while Singaporean dollar deposits remain steady. Deposits in Hong Kong banks have dwindled since early 2022, only halting in November as the Chinese city lifted quarantine restrictions.\n\nThe number of family offices in Singapore — privately run companies that offer wealth management services — has grown from a handful in 2018 to an estimated 1,500 by the end of last year, according to Singaporean data analysis firm Handshakes. Hong Kong, eager to regain ground, will host an “invitation only” meeting for some of the world’s richest family offices next month.\n\nPerceptions that Beijing was increasingly anti-business and anti-private wealth was “the main reason for the migration of Chinese billionaires from mainland or Hong Kong to Singapore and other places”, said Zhiwu Chen, chair professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n“In the past, they might have parked it in Hong Kong but now move to Singapore,” said Kevin Au, director of the Centre for Family Business at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify how many people have moved from Hong Kong to Singapore and banks — hesitant to annoy Beijing — remain reluctant to say how many staff they moved there during the height of the pandemic.\n\nSome had been expanding in Singapore even before the pandemic, especially after the introduction of a tough new security law in Hong Kong in 2020 following protests and unrest. BlackRock doubled the size of its Singapore office in 2022, while Wells Fargo shifted its Asian hub from Hong Kong to Singapore the year before.\n\nAll of this has contributed to rental prices in Singapore surging 40 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year from the same period two years earlier. With 140,000 Hongkongers entering immigration programmes such as the one offered by the UK, rents in Hong Kong dropped 10 per cent in the fourth quarter from an all-time high in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nThis has also affected demand for office space. Grade A office vacancy levels in downtown Singapore stood at 2.3 per cent at the end of last year compared with 11.1 per cent in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong’s proximity to China remains a huge draw for investors. In terms of capital market activity, Hong Kong is still far ahead of Singapore, with stock market turnover and market capitalisation more than seven times larger than its rival.\n\nIn the asset management and advisory service industry, Singapore is fast closing its gap with Hong Kong. In 2021, Singapore’s assets under management grew 16 per cent to $4tn, while Hong Kong’s grew by only 2 per cent to $4.6tn.\n\nMore broadly, with Hong Kong open and China’s abandonment of its zero-Covid policy, the IMF has forecast Hong Kong to grow 3.9 per cent in 2023, faster than Singapore’s 2.3 per cent.\n\nSome Hongkongers could yet return. “There will be some that the political situation in Hong Kong has become intolerable [for], they want to move away and stay away, but there will be some who maybe they could change their mind and economic conditions in the UK or US might not be as good as expected,” said Stuart Gietel-Basten, a demographer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.",

    "body": "Missing Chinese investment banker Bao Fan was preparing to move some of his fortune from China and Hong Kong to Singapore in the months leading up to his disappearance, according to four people with knowledge of his plans.\n\nThe billionaire founder and chair of investment bank China Renaissance, who brokered some of China’s biggest tech deals, was establishing a family office in the city-state to manage his personal wealth in the final months of 2022, the people said.\n\nA growing number of Chinese executives have set up family offices, a privately held company that manages investments, in Singapore after Beijing launched a regulatory assault on the tech sector and an anti-corruption crackdown. They increasingly view the city-state, dubbed the “Switzerland of Asia”, as a haven to park their money.\n\n“Like many wealthy Chinese since the tech crackdown in China and during the pandemic lockdown, he was trying to diversify his wealth in Singapore,” said one of the people.\n\nBao, a veteran of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse who co-founded China Renaissance in 2005, disappeared this month and has been unreachable, his company said last week. The bank said it had not been able to contact Bao, who is its chair, chief executive and controlling shareholder.\n\nOfficials in China have not addressed Bao’s disappearance. China Renaissance executive Cong Lin was detained in September last year not long after the Shanghai branch of China’s securities regulator called in Cong for a “supervisory discussion” about alleged violations in the group’s securities unit.\n\nBao’s disappearance has sent a chill through international financial and business circles in China at a time when Beijing is trying to project a more business-friendly image since relaxing harsh pandemic curbs.\n\nBao had made China Renaissance one of China’s top financial institutions, often winning tech deals from larger Wall Street rivals.\n\nHowever, China’s president Xi Jinping has introduced policies that have hit the tech sector and wealthy tycoons including billionaire Jack Ma, whose listing of Ant Group was suspended by Beijing in 2020.\n\nThe number of family offices launched in Singapore by Chinese nationals eager to secure their family wealth has jumped and many from the mainland have relocated to the city over the same period.\n\nAn individual does not need to be physically present to set up a family office in Singapore, which offers a path to residency. The rise in demand to set up the family office funds and apply for tax incentives has led to long wait times.\n\nWhile getting capital out of mainland China is difficult, many wealthy individuals have assets in places such as Hong Kong, where it is easier to shift money.\n\nIt is unclear if Bao was successful in setting up a fund or if the process is still ongoing. A government portal search showed no family office with Bao listed as director.\n\n“It is difficult to know who is setting these single family offices up,” said one lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivities involved.\n\n“A lot of them use their children’s or spouse’s names as directors while the [Monetary Authority of Singapore] does not license or regulate them as they aren’t managing third party money.”\n\nChina Renaissance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSingapore’s government has taken steps to boost the city’s appeal as a wealth management centre. In 2019, the MAS and the Economic Development Board established a Family Office Development Team to attract more family funds.\n\nThe number of family offices has grown from a handful in 2018 to an estimated 1,500 by the end of last year, according to Singaporean data analysis firm Handshakes.\n\nAdditional reporting by Joe Leahy in Beijing",

    "body": "Two years ago, Lauren arrived in Singapore from Hong Kong wanting more living space for her growing family. Now, they intend to move back. The reason: a 61 per cent increase in the rent on their four-bedroom flat and the high and rising cost of living.\n\nA British mother of three whose husband works in finance, Lauren, who did not want to use her full name, said her experience of Asia’s two rival financial centres has been an eye opener. “Everyone thinks Hong Kong is the most expensive city,” she said.\n\nHer situation is not unusual in the cosmopolitan city-state of 5.6mn people in which a quarter of the workforce is foreign.\n\nA lack of housing supply due to construction delays during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as a wave of new arrivals from places including Hong Kong, China, Europe and Japan last year, pushed residential rents to the highest on record, according to the government’s private residential property rental index.\n\nRent per square foot in some central areas has overtaken Hong Kong for the first time, data shows. Analysts warn that prices could rise as much as 20 per cent again this year as real estate agents report bidding frenzies for desirable properties.\n\nThe situation underscores the cost of Singapore’s campaign to replace Hong Kong as the Asian destination for money and investment. Tough Covid-19 restrictions in the Chinese territory encouraged many to relocate, and the number of Employment Pass and S Pass holders — the main visas used by foreign professionals — increased 4.5 per cent to 338,000 in the 18 months until the end of June last year.\n\nBut higher rental prices could undermine Singapore’s attempts to become Asia’s dominant financial hub and attract the best talent, experts said.\n\nSingapore’s government has been reluctant to help a mostly affluent minority. In November, in response to questions from members of parliament, it said that rent was only one factor for those considering a move to the city-state.\n\nOthers “include Singapore’s standing as a global business hub, our strong external connectivity, our good trade links, our education and healthcare standards and the quality of life”, said Desmond Lee, minister for national development.\n\nStill, the high cost of living in Singapore, even with low taxes, is creating a “real crunch”, said Woo Jun Jie, a senior research fellow at Singapore’s Institute of Policy Studies. “It is something foreigners face more of the brunt of because most locals live in public housing and go to public schools.” About 80 per cent of Singaporeans live in lower-cost public housing.\n\n“Singapore had a huge influx of people and business since Covid, we were seen as a safe haven during the pandemic. But [high rents] will affect Singapore as a business hub and I think some of it [business] will inevitably flow back into other markets, especially smaller players,” he added.\n\nNicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at the ERA Realty Network, said rents could increase another 10 to 20 per cent this year. “Singapore’s small size means when you apply temperature, things boil fast. There is not a lot of spare capacity,” he said.\n\nEmma, a marketing professional, moved with her family to Singapore from Hong Kong five years ago and was living in a three-bedroom flat in the island-resort area of Sentosa. The landlord informed her in November the rent would increase from S$7,000 ($5,200) per month to S$14,000. When they tried to negotiate, they were told to look in other suburbs.\n\n“Our salaries have not gone up by 100 per cent or even 50 per cent — that is all our savings,” she added. She did not want her real name to be used for fear of jeopardising negotiations over their deposit. The family has since decided to return to Australia.\n\nShantanu Upadhuay, from India, works at a popular restaurant as front-of-house staff in the city’s Chinatown district. The 29-year-old is also moving to Australia with his fiancée after his S$500 rent more than doubled. “I can’t see myself getting ahead here, I have no savings now. In Australia, you can afford a car and have a life,” he said.\n\nReal estate agents agree there is a problem. “I witnessed a crazy incident last year with tenants outbidding each other. It lost control. People are very upset,” said Edna Liong, who liaises with tenants for Huttons Asia. “What some landlords are asking for is not reasonable.”\n\nAnother agent, Ina Sultan of ERA, this month made headlines for asking 11 Chinese tenants to vacate their overcrowded flat in a public housing unit. Sultan said: “The problem of overcrowding is not new here, but I expect to see more of this because of prices.”\n\nThe bigger picture, agents said, was that rents in Singapore were still catching up after years of decline. “Landlords suffered with low rents for many years and nobody brought this issue up,” Sultan added.\n\nIt is clear that for all its attractions, high costs in Singapore are becoming a deterrent, said Jon Goldstein, managing partner of Page Executive Singapore, an executive recruiter. “The question at the mid-level of ‘should we stay or should we go’ — you are hearing that discussion a bit more.”\n\nEven those who have found apartments are unsure about the future.\n\n“If you told me five years ago I would be paying S$6,500 for a very old three-bedroom apartment, I would have said that is insane,” said Marta, a 34-year-old working mother who also did not want her full name to be published for fear of jeopardising her visa.\n\nShe moved to the flat last year after her previous landlord asked for a 60 per cent increase in rent. “This was the best option we could find, but after this lease expires we may consider leaving.”",

    "blurb": "Standard Chartered and other incumbents take lead in push for virtual lending",

    "body": "Digital banking is accelerating in Singapore as deregulation encourages tech companies like Grab to enter the market in the hope of attracting younger customers and small businesses.\n\nWhile this is expected to foster banking competition, retail virtual banks have yet to bring their operations fully online because of lingering regulatory restrictions. Meanwhile, incumbents like Standard Chartered are digitising their services at an accelerating pace.\n\nGXS, a digital bank majority owned by Grab, operator of south-east Asia’s ubiquitous superapp, has expanded services since opening in September. GXS’s app hardly looks like a banking app. With its black and purple colour scheme, it has more of a music-streaming vibe.\n\nThe app updates GXS account holders with daily reports on how much interest their deposits have accrued. While a regular savings account offers 0.08 per cent interest, time deposits, opened for specific purposes such as travel or layaway purchases, earn 3.48 per cent. GXS hopes to increase user engagement by letting customers see the interest they earn every day.\n\n“We are a bank created by digital natives for digital natives,” CEO Charles Wong told Nikkei Asia. GXS is targeting so-called gig economy workers like those who deliver meals or give commuters rides via the Grab app. The bank also looks to lure those just starting out in their careers. There is no minimum balance or account maintenance fees.\n\nGrab owns 60 per cent of GXS, with Singapore telco Singtel holding the rest. The partners have a combined local customer base of more than 3mn and can gather reams of data that will tell them what their account holders like to eat, where they commute and how much they use their mobile phones. GXS executives believe that by analysing this data, the bank can offer timely small loans, insurance products and other financial services.\n\nDeregulation has made it possible for nonbank companies such as Grab to enter Singapore’s virtual lending market. In June 2019, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced the creation of two licences, including a digital full banking licence, which allows holders to serve individuals and other customers. It also announced a digital wholesale banking licence, with plans to issue up to five of the new licences in total.\n\nThe Singaporean central bank was responding to similar moves by other Asian countries. In South Korea, internet giant Kakao got into banking in 2017, and Hong Kong issued digital banking licences in 2019.\n\n“We must take advantage of these opportunities that digital finance brings,” MAS chair Tharman Shanmugaratnam said, “and not be overtaken by the wave of changes taking place globally.”\n\nInterests were high during the four-month filing period, when 21 companies and groups, including foreign entities such as Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, submitted applications for digital banking licences in Singapore. Another Chinese tech giant, ByteDance, owner of the TikTok video-sharing app, was reportedly among the applicants.\n\nIn the end, the Grab-Singtel consortium and Singaporean ecommerce player Sea were granted digital full banking licences. But despite high hopes, neither has made much of a splash in the nascent market. GXS provides services to selected Grab and Singtel clients, while Sea is rolling out on an invitation-only basis. Neither has disclosed precise customer numbers.\n\nLingering regulations aimed at ensuring digital banks’ financial stability are behind the slow rollout. For retail services, one regulation caps aggregate deposits at S$50mn ($37mn) during the entry phase. The government has yet to announce when full-scale services will be permitted.\n\nIn the meantime, Standard Chartered, one of the UK’s largest banks, has begun operating a digital bank called Trust Bank, which has attracted more than 400,000 users in four months. Trust Bank was founded with FairPrice Group, operator of Singapore’s biggest supermarket chain.\n\n“Banks have to transform themselves from being just a bank to becoming part of an ecosystem,” Dwaipayan Sadhu, CEO of Trust Bank, told Nikkei. Trust offers deposit accounts, credit cards and insurance policies through an app. Customers can earn loyalty points and coupons from partner brands.\n\nFreed from the expense of operating physical outlets, the digital bank can lower the cost of winning customers and share the savings with them in the form of higher interest on their deposits, Sadhu said.\n\nTrust obtained a licence that allows it to offer services similar to those of conventional banks. It developed a core banking system, which resides on a cloud platform, jointly with Thought Machine, a British unicorn that counts JPMorgan Chase as a shareholder.\n\nMeanwhile, Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Chinese tech giant Alibaba, obtained a digital wholesale licence, which allows it to conduct transactions for corporations. Ant’s digital-only Anext Bank allows companies registered in Singapore to open an online corporate account in an instant, even from overseas, a first in the city-state, the bank says.\n\n“We are clear on our mission to accelerate financial inclusion through technology-driven innovation,” Anext CEO Toh Su Mei told Nikkei, adding that the bank intends “to better serve the underserved SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises] not just in Singapore but also across the region”.\n\nThe bank’s online loan service, which will become fully available by June, does not require application forms for unsecured loans of less than S$30,000 with a cap of S$300,000. The service instead sifts through data provided by credit information organisations, with customer permission, and deposits approved loans almost immediately upon receiving an application.\n\nIn one estimate, about 80 per cent of Asia’s cross-border ecommerce services are operated by small to medium-size enterprises, many of which lack ready access to financial services. In a 2020 survey by Visa, 88 per cent of SMEs in Singapore said they planned to make at least some of their transactions digitally.\n\nBut it remains to be seen how much of a share digital banks can take. Singapore is said to be overbanked as it is, with 98 per cent of the adult population already account holders. Globally, there are about 250 digital-only banks. According to Moody’s Investors Service, their combined banking assets represent 0.4 per cent of those of traditional banks.\n\n“We can expect the retail banking market to grow” in Singapore, Jan Ondrus, associate professor of information systems at ESSEC Business School Asia-Pacific, told Nikkei. “The new digital banks will not replace the traditional ones but complement their offerings, at least in the early days.”\n\nIn the medium to long term, digital banks are expected to utilise their technology in other markets in south-east Asia, where, unlike in Singapore, many residents remain unbanked or underserved. Moves to issue digital banking licences are afoot in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Grab plans to open digital banks in Indonesia and Malaysia this year.\n\n“We have in place a regional technology architecture, including our core banking system, which our digital banks in Malaysia and Indonesia can tap or repurpose,” GXS’s Wong said, describing a set-up that will keep costs low as Grab opens banks in more countries.\n\nStill, a bumpy road lies ahead for tech companies struggling with their core businesses. Sea has cut staff, and Grab has frozen employee recruitment. Both are operating in the red and have less scope to invest heavily into new services now than when they filed for their digital banking licences in Singapore.\n\n“Most of the incumbent banks have trusted brands, large customer bases and a broad set of products and services that drive profitable business models,” Eddy Kwong, director and digital business lead for Asia Pacific at Allianz Global Investors, told Nikkei.\n\n“Digital banks have not had the time to develop these capabilities yet and face the uphill battle of tackling customer aversion to change,” he added.\n\nThis story has been amended to correct a reference to regulations governing retail deposits.\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on February 27 2023. ©2023 Nikkei Inc.

    "body": "Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC has put the brakes on private investments in China as it steps up scrutiny of risks in the world’s second-biggest economy.\n\nGIC, one of the world’s largest investors in private equity funds, has scaled back commitments to China-focused private equity and venture capital funds over the past year, five people with knowledge of the matter said. It has also significantly slowed the pace of its direct investments in private Chinese companies.\n\nAlthough GIC was an early backer of China’s economic growth story, some of the fund’s most senior figures have struck a more cautious tone on investing in the country during internal discussions over the past year, two of the people said.\n\nThe fierce debate inside one of Asia’s most powerful sovereign wealth funds reflects concern over how some of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s policies might affect investors despite the end of zero-Covid curbs that hit growth last year.\n\n“They have dramatically decreased investments,” said one executive who had sought to tap GIC for funds to invest partly in China, adding that the “pivot” came at a time when it was difficult for funds to find other places to invest on the same scale.\n\nITjuzi, a data provider that monitors investments in China, recorded just two direct investments in Chinese companies by GIC last year, down from 16 in 2021.\n\nExecutives and senior managers are uneasy about growing geopolitical risk from souring US-China relations and are concerned that Xi’s “common prosperity” drive to reduce economic inequality in the country could have unintended negative consequences, two people close to GIC’s decision-making process said.\n\nGIC, chaired by Singapore’s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, has an estimated $700bn under management and has reaped impressive financial returns from China over almost three decades.\n\nBut GIC’s investments in China, which it does not quantify, have been hit by the country’s property crisis and Beijing’s crackdown on its own tech companies. The fund has been a significant investor in Chinese real estate and owns a stake in Ant Group, whose planned $37bn initial public offering was halted by Chinese regulators in 2020.\n\nThe fund was “burnt bad” by the crackdown on Ant and has become wary of other unexpected moves from Beijing that could hit its investments or its ability to exit them, one of the people said.\n\nInvestors said GIC executives indicated they were pausing investments and slowing decision-making commitments to China but were open to future discussions.\n\n“This is consistent with what many sovereign wealth funds and pension funds are doing,” one of the people said. “Don’t be surprised if they’re among the first to come back . . . they know China much better than others.”\n\nPrivate equity and venture capital funds targeting China deals raised a total of $108bn in 2021, up from $23bn in 2010, according to Preqin data, a sign of how capital has flooded into the country as its economy has boomed.\n\nBut fundraising slowed globally last year, as investors became more cautious about locking up their cash in illiquid funds.\n\nThe size of GIC’s publicly disclosed stakes in listed Chinese companies, a more liquid investment, fell 4.4 per cent in the year to December 2022, according to Bloomberg data, though it has risen 11 per cent since. The data does not include stakes that are below disclosure thresholds.\n\nGIC, which has offices in Shanghai and Beijing, said it still had “significant exposures” to China and that it “continues to explore long-term opportunities”.\n\nA quarter of GIC’s overall portfolio was invested in Asia, excluding Japan, in the year to March 2022, according to its annual report.\n\nThe reductions in China came as GIC ramped up overall investment. It deployed $40.3bn last year, 17 per cent more than in 2021, according to industry tracker Global SWF.\n\nOther large investors have also become more wary of China as tensions with the US rise. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan has paused direct investing in private assets in the country, partly because of geopolitical risk, Bloomberg reported last month.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong and Ryan McMorrow in Beijing",

    "body": "As regional and global environmental, social and governance-related regulations evolve and proliferate, the costs for Asian fund firms of keeping up with the various requirements across markets will continue to rise, experts say.\n\nBut with enforcement action for failing to conform with anti-greenwashing rules expected to grow, experts highlight that the potential costs and reputational risks of non-compliance are rising too.\n\nXuan Sheng Ou Yong, Singapore-based green bonds and environmental social and governance (ESG) analyst at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said compliance and operational costs have continued to increase as regulators in different markets make adjustments to ESG investing and disclosure frameworks.\n\n“I don’t think we are close to a plateau — asset managers and investors will continue to spend more,” he said.\n\nGreater resources are needed not just to pay for developing in-house strategies and to communicate these to investors, he noted, but also to comply with different European and Asian regulatory requirements.\n\n“I wouldn’t expect anyone to reduce their investments in this space in the coming years,” Ou Yong added.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore introduced its first-ever guidance for disclosure and reporting for retail ESG funds last July, shortly after announcing plans to conduct climate-related stress tests on fund firms.\n\nThe MAS-backed Green Finance Industry Taskforce also rolled out a second green and transition taxonomy consultation last May, including guidelines for asset managers on how to apply the framework. This followed the release in February of green skillset guidelines, which aim to encourage firms to design new training programmes.\n\nThe moves are part of a wave of new regulatory requirements in Singapore and have been met by calls for greater clarity from financial institutions.\n\nWhile fund companies now view incorporating ESG practices as integral to their business, questions are being raised about the resources needed to keep up with all this new regulation.\n\n“How do you square increasing regulations and operational costs with ESG as a growth driver — it’s almost like a chicken and egg problem,” said Ng Sze Yoon, Singapore-based principal of distribution insight for Asia Pacific at Broadridge.\n\nESG is becoming more of an “infrastructure capability” as opposed to a standalone investment strategy, said Ng, and asset managers now needed to integrate it across the entire business, including investment products, servicing and operations.\n\nExisting ESG regulations and standards are also evolving and shifting, with many asset managers currently facing challenges complying with the European Union’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation’s level two standards, for example, which recently came into force.\n\nThe SFDR’s level two standards come with a stricter definition of what can be classified as the “darkest green” Article 9 fund, as well as an increased reporting requirement for such funds.\n\nBNPP AM’s Ou Yong said the French manager’s global sustainability team had more than tripled since 2019.\n\nDespite the rising costs of having to comply with ESG regulation, more than two-thirds of Singapore fund firms see increasing investment into ESG strategies as the top expected driver of growth over the next three years, according to an Investment Management Association of Singapore survey, with many viewing it as a means to achieve differentiation.\n\nSustainable investing remains “if not the main, it’s one of the strategic growth drivers” for BNPP AM in terms of flows and asset growth, said BNPP AM’s Ou Yong.\n\nBut for managers that are not making ESG a priority, the pace of development in ESG regulations means that time is running out, as institutional investor expectations rise.\n\n“Anybody who wants to stand out beyond the rest of the playing field has to demonstrate a lot more ESG credentials and capabilities,” Broadridge’s Ng said.\n\nGrace Chong, Singapore-based counsel and head of the Singapore financial regulatory practice at Gibson Dunn, said fund firms also had to think about the increasing risks of not complying.\n\nMany firms are also banking on the fact that Hong Kong and Singapore broadly accept SFDR standards as being locally compliant, but local regulators could add their own additional requirements at any time.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

    "body": "This article is part of a guide to Singapore from FT Globetrotter\n\nFor almost five years, I lived a commuter’s life between London and Singapore. In the Lion City I had a house to lay my head in, but work often required me to road-test hotels both new and established, and I was asked by friends often enough for recommendations that I kept my finger on the pulse of who was doing what, where. Now that I’m no longer a local, Singapore’s hotels feature more holistically in my experience of the city; based on what I’m travelling for (work, friends, a stopover I need to cram both into), I care about neighbourhood, size, vibe and service. (Ah, service in Singapore. Still occasionally a bit of a blip issue . . .)\n\nThe good news is the hotel scene seems to be evolving into something befitting the size and sophistication of Singapore. An Edition, a Mondrian and a Standard are all in the pipeline — youthful brands with high design and reputations for plugging ably into local scenes. And Raffles is set to plant a second Singapore flag on Sentosa Island later this year. So whether you’re after a deep-dive into the cocktail-bar scene or a poolside loll followed by a Michelin-starred dinner, there will soon be more choice than ever. Meanwhile, here is a selection from among the city’s very best options, for different agendas.\n\nThe USP: Its heritage. From the name (taken from Singapore’s colonial founder, Sir Stamford Raffles) to the Long Bar (welcoming peanut shell-chucking expats since the early 1900s), it’s one of south-east Asia’s most storied hostelries, a semaphore in white stucco for the Lion City’s British East Indies history. In 2017-19 it underwent a total renovation by New York-based designer Alexandra Champalimaud, and while some of the public spaces gleam almost unrecognisably with slick new finishes and crystal lights, the overall Raffles gentility is still intact.\n\nThe rooms: There are 115, and thanks to the building’s generous proportions, the most modest (about 500 sq ft) puts rooms that call themselves suites in other hotels to shame. Champalimaud’s intervention was, cleverly, minimal. A few choice furnishings have been updated from ’80s staid to 21st-century low-slung: spacious armoires gleam with polished metal and leather linings; pretty encaustic tiles adorn the bathrooms. But the original hardwood floors remain, as do the lazily spinning ceiling fans and four-poster beds. And the long, shared verandas are, blissfully, still long and shared.\n\nFood and drink: A smorgasbord of destination tables, many of which are primarily the preserve of tourists and businesspeople. You can still throw peanut shells at the now quite gussied-up Long Bar, but the Writers Bar next to the lobby, with its tryst-ready corners, is the chicer drinks venue. Take the constituents you need to impress to Anne-Sophie Pic’s stellar La Dame de Pic or to Yì, where Jereme Leung does very haute Chinese cuisine. Refined primi piatti and Super Tuscan reds are served at Alain Ducasse’s cheery Italian, Osteria BBR, formerly the hotel’s Bar & Billiards Room. But for my money, the most fun is to be had at Butcher’s Block, where Hawaiian chef Jordan Keao does brilliant, kind-of-Hawaiian, kind-of-Asian things with both meat and veg in his open kitchens.\n\nSpa: A gorgeous one in the Raffles Arcade, a three-minute meander from reception.\n\nGym: Yes — it’s not huge, but serviceable, with personal training available.\n\nRates: Double, from S$1,300 (about £795)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: Space, service and extreme family-friendliness.\n\nMore of a small citadel than a hotel, the flagship Shangri-La comprises the Tower, Garden and Valley Wings. The pool is truly enormous; the 15 acres of landscaping are mature and lovely; the Garden Wing’s terraces overflow with pink bougainvillea. There are space-, safari-, castle-, underwater-, treetop- and space-themed suites for the tots. But there are also concierges to service any and all business needs, from cars to translators — as well as an excellent Club Lounge, and some of the speediest butler service I’ve ever had.\n\nThe rooms: Besides those themed kiddie suites, design-wise things are fairly straightforward, if also comfortable. The Tower Wing rooms are spare and a bit monochrome, but well configured for work, with large desks (often set in a window, so you face out to the view), plenty of outlets and good lighting. The bathrooms are smallish but good, clad in marble and dark wood. For longer stays, the Horizon Club Junior suites are like little apartments, complete with slick kitchenettes and dining areas.\n\nFood and drink: As at Raffles, the options here cut a wide swath, from Italian at Waterfall to sashimi at Nami to a sublime version of chicken rice — that staple of hawker centres — in the patrician Lobby Lounge that earned its not-so-hawker-centre price tag. Breakfast at The Line is a thing of wonder: a United Nations of regional specialities — nasi goreng, siu mai dumplings, bagels, Cronuts and every imaginable thing in between, spread across what feels like acres of counter and cart space.\n\nSpa: One of the best in town, and a favourite of locals. Shangri-La’s Chi brand is well established, and this one is a hushed, private enclave done with low lighting and lots of warm wood and colour.\n\nGym: Yes, with row upon row of Life Fitness aerobic machines. A bonus: the hotel’s two outdoor tennis courts.\n\nRates: Double, from S$380 (about £230)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: A colonial “godown” (warehouse) that eventually became a disco, which became the first hospitality project of local restaurant impresario Wee Teng Wen (whose Lo & Behold group counts some of the city’s finest drinking and dining venues in its portfolio), The Warehouse is, for now anyway, Singapore’s design hotel par excellence. Local firms Zarch Collaboratives and Asylum recast the old spaces with clever lighting, lots of smoothed concrete and some post-industrial-vibes beams and metalwork.\n\nThe location, right across the river from Robertson Quay, is ideal for foodies (there’s a plethora of good eats within walking distance, from high-end Neapolitan pizza to old-school chilli crab), runners and walkers (the river paths, which run all the way to Marina Bay, are great for otter-spotting), and anyone who wants a change from the touristic Orchard or Beach Roads, or the CBD, Singapore’s business and financial district.\n\nThe rooms: Understated, minimal but not cold, and very clever in how they leverage space. All 37 rooms and suites have elegant freestanding units variously combining wardrobe, workspace, storage and minibars. Floors are smooth timber; bedding is soft and cozy; bathrooms have big showers and generous sink space — even the very compact Warehouse Sanctuaries, the smallest room category. The River View Mezzanine has a soaring ceiling and tons of natural light; the River View suite is a single-level loft, with a sexy open-plan bathroom.\n\nFood and drink: The Lobby Bar is also the lounge and reception in one unstructured space — but it works, with a sunken bar along one wall and long, low butterscotch-leather sofas arranged in seating areas along the room’s perimeter; it’s a great place to invite friends to start off an evening. Po, the small restaurant adjacent to the lobby, elevates heritage and home-cooking traditions — in this case, Singapore’s own. Delicious, carby Asian comfort food.\n\nSpa: No\n\nGym: No, but there is a small rooftop pool.\n\nRates: Double, from S$404 (about £250)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: Maxwell Reserve, housed in a century-old British colonial-administration building, started out in 2019 as one half of the Six Senses Singapore, which retired the management account in 2020; the other half, Duxton Reserve, now comes, like Maxwell, under Marriott’s Autograph Collection. The three-storey building sits at the border of Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar, two of Singapore’s culturally and architecturally most interesting neighbourhoods (the latter also one of its nightlife hubs — you’re in striking distance of some of the city’s buzziest cocktail bars and restaurants, as well as the Maxwell Food Centre, reliably good for all sorts of hawker specialities).\n\nThe rooms: All 138 were designed by Jacques Garcia, so are heavy on jewel tones, velvet, Persian rugs and passementerie. The 160 sq ft Petit Club rooms are compact, but perfect for a solo traveller, with alcove beds framed in a peacock-feather jacquard fabric and plenty of daylight. The Junior Club and Salon Club suites have multiple windows and generous separate seating areas. The minibars, stocked with small-batch spirits, craft aperitifs and gorgeous mixing kit, are a win.\n\nFood and drink: Several on-site options, including an Indian restaurant, Shikar, and a steak house called the Officer’s Mess Polo Bar, as well an almost outré jewel-box drinking establishment, Isabel, with a backlit pink-onyx bar and yet more red velvet (fun for the ’gram addicts, perhaps). But the fact is, in this neighbourhood you’ll probably be eating elsewhere.\n\nSpa: No, but there is an outdoor rooftop lap pool.\n\nGym: Yes, small but serviceable.\n\nRates: S$420 (about £255)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: Island-idyll feels; marquee-name architecture; serious luxury.\n\nSet on the south-west side of Sentosa Island, about a 20-minute taxi ride from the CBD (on a good-traffic day), this was the first Capella hotel to open, 14 years ago. Sentosa is home to golf courses, yacht clubs, and an integrated resort or two; there’s a Disney-esque vibe to much of the island, but there are also quite lovely parts, where dense greenery gives way to South China Sea views, imparting passable island-holiday vibes. The Capella, on a nicely landscaped hill, enjoys one of the best vantages, in two late 19th-century Tanah Merah colonial barracks joined by a sinuous extension courtesy of Foster + Partners. No wonder it’s a staycation favourite — it very much says “resort” rather than hotel.\n\nThe rooms: Capella is a five-star enterprise all the way, and this is reflected in the design. Entry-level rooms are long, large and softly contemporary, with gleaming timber floors and picture windows overlooking the water (usually dotted with supertankers, but still). The suites carry the design over into bigger spaces with separate sitting areas, while 38 villas take it into serviced private-residence dimensions, all with plunge pools and terraces. Three manor houses — two colonial, one contemporary — offer the full Monty: multiple en suite bedrooms, dining rooms, cook’s kitchens and their own pools and terraces.\n\nFood and drink: What you’d expect at a place of this calibre, ranging from Fiamma (a new Italian overseen by star chef Mauro Colagreco) and Cassia (contemporary Chinese, in a stunning room designed by Andre Fu) to Bob’s Bar, which capitalises on the resort’s prime sundowner position with outdoor seating.\n\nSpa: Yes — the Auriga spa, a multi-award-winner that offers Biologique Recherche facials and a daunting number of combination-treatment Wellness Journeys (with attendant price tags).\n\nGym: Also excellent, all Technogym aerobic equipment, full weight circuits, and personal trainers by appointment.\n\nRates: Double, from S$1,600 (about £980)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: A centre-of-the-action location on Collyer Quay; fast, polished service; proximity to the CBD.\n\nThe ace in Fullerton Bay’s pocket is arguably its situation: overlooking Raffles Place, the Singapore Flyer big wheel and the three infinity-pool-crowned towers of the Marina Bay Sands hotel-casino complex (you could stay there, but trust me — it’s better to wonder at the spectacle from these coordinates). It happens to also be a lovely hotel: modern, full of light, with elegant interiors by Andre Fu and a youthful staff who’ve always impressed during my various stays. And there are few better places to catch the nightly Spectra light and water show than from a table at Lantern, the Fullerton Bay’s rooftop bar. It’s an easy 10-minute walk to Marina Bay Sands and its gargantuan shopping mall offering (which runs the gamut from Céline to Din Tai Fung), and a further 10 minutes to the weirdly wonderful Gardens By The Bay. The CBD is an easy walk in the other direction.\n\nThe rooms: They do the job, in the best possible way. The entry-level double is more than 450 sq ft, with clever sliding partitions separating the bathroom from the bedroom, for enjoying the views while you soak in the tub. Every one of them has a well-provisioned work area and a small separate sitting area. The windows throughout the hotel are floor-to-ceiling, so light is a USP all day. A few of the Bay View rooms have terraces with Jacuzzis. Design throughout is what you might call subtle contemporary pan-Asian: glossy hardwood details, hits of bold-hued silk, lots of orchids.\n\nFood and drink: Breakfast is served in La Brasserie, a pretty double-height space at ground level that’s also open for lunch and dinner. With its more than 200 covers, The Clifford Pier, the hotel’s heritage lobby restaurant, is vast, though pretty; and there’s an equally attractive afternoon tea with views served at The Landing Point. But Lantern and its views are probably the winner here, given how easy your access is from the Fullerton Bay to many of Sing’s favourite eateries in Tanjong Pagar and Telok Ayer (another easy, if occasionally sweaty, 10 or 15-minute walk).\n\nGym: Yes, full service, and a 25m lap pool on the hotel’s roof.\n\nSpa: Not on site, but guests have booking privileges at the spa at the Fullerton Hotel, about a 10-minute walk up Fullerton Road.\n\nRates: Double, from S$901 (about £550)\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nThe USPs: A CBD-meets-Chinatown location; value for money; cool architecture creds.\n\nWOHA is one of Singapore’s most laurelled architecture firms, having designed local rapid-transit stations, luxury resorts on Bali and even a university campus in Bangladesh. And the Oasia is one of the most distinctive buildings on the Singapore skyline, thanks to its striking combination of bright-red aluminium mesh cladding and lush green vertical plantings, evidencing a full 21 different species. Three interior “verandas” — entire floors given over to outdoor space — create additional bio-havens (the green “quantum” WOHA has achieved here is tantamount to requirements for 10 whole buildings). This means two outdoor pools, plus a yoga lawn — all many storeys above the city.\n\nRooms and suites: Nice clean lines and lots of light wood, minimal frippery — the basics you need (a good bed; a wall-mounted TV with lots of channels; a small but serviceable work space; natural light; bathtubs in the Club rooms), and not much you don’t. The views-for-days from most of them are a bonus.\n\nFood and drink: There’s all-day simple dining at The Marmalade Pantry, on the hotel’s ground floor (think salads and sweet-potato fries, a handful of pastas and fancy sandwiches), which is where hotel guests eat breakfast. OSO Ristorante, while not part of the actual hotel, is a haute Italian-leaning venue on the tower’s 27th floor. Along with nice sharing plates of cheese and salumi (and caviar, if it’s your thing), there’s an extensive entrée menu that’s very carnivore-friendly.\n\nGym: Yes — like the rooms, compact and not complicated, but with what you need: treadmills, ellipticals, weights and room for stretching. Weekly yoga classes are complimentary (though first come, first served).\n\nSpa: None, but staff can recommend local day spas for treatments.\n\nRates: Double, from S$284 (about £170).\n\nWebsite; Directions\n\nTell us about your favourite place to stay in Singapore in the comments\n\nFollow FT Globetrotter on Instagram at @FTGlobetrotter",

    "body": "On a busy penultimate day at Davos yesterday, Greta Thunberg and her fellow activists didn’t disappoint. Returning to the Swiss town after three years, Thunberg delivered a blistering attack on the World Economic Forum’s claim to be building a better world for all, as she cast the assembled corporate elite as a key driver of the climate emergency. “The people who we really should be listening to are not here,” she said. “Instead we are bombarded with messages from . . . the people who are causing this crisis.”\n\nIt’s hard to argue with that. Still, for journalists covering the drive for a more sustainable world economy, this week has been a useful opportunity to gain insights from meetings with figures from around the world. We’ll be back on Monday with a final round-up of our main takeaways.\n\nIn today’s edition, Gillian highlights a possible shift in the shape of philanthropy in Asia. And Kenza updates us on the insurance sector’s continued struggles to grasp the climate nettle. Have a good weekend. (Simon Mundy)\n\nDavos devotees often argue that the main benefit of the event is that it fosters partnerships. This week, one small sign of such a partnership emerged in relation to Asia: Temasek Trust, the philanthropic arm of Singapore’s Temasek sovereign wealth fund, announced its backing for the World Economic Forum’s “Giving to Amplify Earth Action Initiative” to fight climate change.\n\nIt’s true that there are a lot of pious pledges floating in the Davos air. But this one in particular is a striking straw in the wind of a bigger shift. While the region has billions of dollars of philanthropic capital in the hands of rich families, this has hitherto been used primarily to support domestic issues, in a fairly ad hoc, fragmented way, with little channelled to climate change.\n\nBut what Temasek Trust is trying to do is position itself — and Singapore — as a hub for this philanthropy to create a more co-ordinated initiative for environmental action. The trust has already got the backing of some western charities, such as the Gates Foundation, and big individual donors such as Ray Dalio. And it’s now trying to gain further support from Asia’s richest families.\n\nIf this gains momentum, Temasek Trust hopes to use its money and expertise to not only design and lead projects, but also — perhaps most crucially — develop blended finance initiatives, using philanthropy to underwrite some of the risks of private sector investments in climate infrastructure in the region.\n\nWill it work? This is still unclear. But Temasek starts with a big advantage: it has deep (ish) pockets, a strong record of efficiency — and Singapore is arguably the most neutral hub in Asia. Moreover, as Asia rises in financial power on the world stage, there is a growing desire to get more involved in climate change diplomacy. And the younger generations of Asia’s rich families stand to inherit vast sums in the coming years, and often have a strong desire to get involved in the fight. (Gillian Tett)\n\nAxa, Allianz, Swiss Re and other major insurers laid out an industry blueprint for climate goals at Davos this week, detailing the role they intend to play in the energy transition.\n\nWhether clean or dirty, infrastructure and energy projects must obtain insurance cover before they can get credit from banks, thrusting the operations of insurers, reinsurers and brokers into the spotlight.\n\nThe Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), a climate-focused industry club whose members’ portfolios account for 15 per cent of global premiums, has given insurers until July 2024 to choose at least three climate targets to report against annually.\n\nAmong their options: expanding the number of clients who have set science-based net zero goals; doing more underwriting business for weather-related damage, carbon removal technologies or clean energy; and moving away from the most polluting clients.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum by video link on Tuesday, former Bank of England governor Mark Carney described the target-setting guidelines as “a hugely important step on the industry’s journey towards net zero, but also the world’s move to that same objective”.\n\nCarney said insurers served as “society’s early warning system”, and were on the “front lines” of climate change, given the annual disaster-related losses exceeding $100bn that they have had to cover in recent years.\n\nThe NZIA has been plagued with fears that collective action to boycott certain industries could amount to a breach of competition law, and resisted pressure last year to recommend its members stop insuring all new coal projects, citing competition law risks.\n\nIt has, to a large extent, been playing catch-up with other groupings in the umbrella body Carney founded, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Banking and asset owners issued their own target-setting guidelines in 2021 or earlier.\n\nActivists argue that what insurers have now come up with amounts to a “frustrating step backwards”, for three geeky reasons.\n\nFirstly, one of the decarbonisation targets insurers can choose from calls for them to cut emissions such as carbon and methane by at least 34 per cent by 2030 — notably lower than the minimum 43 per cent cut that the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said is aligned with the Paris agreement.\n\nSecondly, certain important types of insurance, such as construction risk, which would be needed to build oil and gas plants, are out of scope.\n\nFinally, targets do not have to include the scope 3 emissions of insurers’ clients — emissions related to their supply chains and the use of products — for many companies, the biggest part of their carbon footprint. This appears to be at odds with a UN standard laid out at COP27 for the integrity of net zero targets, as well as the UN’s Race to Zero campaign. Both stipulate carbon accounting should include mandatory disclosure of indirect emissions.\n\nThe targets follow a first attempt at drawing up global carbon accounting rules for insurers by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) at the end of last year. Its insurance industry members now have until the end of 2025 to publish a breakdown of their clients’ direct emissions — also omitting scope 3.\n\nPerhaps because it is an accounting body with a boring name, PCAF has been more successful at attracting members from the US, such as Liberty Mutual and MassMutual. Currently, the NZIA’s only North American member is Fidelis Insurance, based in Bermuda. It says a priority for the coming year is to expand further into that region. (Kenza Bryan)\n\nDon’t miss Martin Wolf’s magisterial essay on the crisis of democratic capitalism, in an age of strongman demagoguery, culture wars and severe inequality. The answer, he writes, must be “a political response rooted not in the destructive politics of identity, but of welfare for all citizens — that is, a commitment to economic opportunity and basic security for all”.",

    "body": "Shortly after opening its doors on a Tuesday morning in mid-December, the Rolls-Royce showroom in Singapore’s Redhill neighbourhood was already bustling. US-China tensions remain high, financial markets are skittish, the risk of global recession looms heavily: it is the perfect time to put down an $80,000 deposit on a hot pink Phantom.\n\nThe number of Rolls-Royce cars registered in Singapore surged in 2021 and remained at record levels in 2022 — waiting lists for the cars now stretch into years. One type of buyer dominates. For the cars that leave the forecourt, a predictable future in the city-state awaits — shuttling the short routes between the mansions and apartments of Sentosa and other pockets of extreme wealth to luxury shopping malls, the discreet offices of their family funds and the private clubs of Orchard. According to employees at the showroom, the new buyers are overwhelmingly Chinese.\n\nThe flows are part of a transformation of Singapore that is becoming a proxy for the way in which one segment of China is dealing with geopolitical tension and decoupling.\n\nChinese individuals, their families, their companies and their advisers, according to a wide range of bankers, lawyers, accountants and investors interviewed by the Financial Times, now see Singapore as the vessel that can navigate them through a series of expected storms. At the same time, they add, it is becoming an increasingly vital place for outposts of Wall Street and the global financial industry to interact with them. For many years, Singapore has liked to sell itself as the Switzerland of Asia. The new cold war, says one former top official, is finally turning that pitch into a reality. The big question, though, is how far Singapore will tolerate being Switzerland with Chinese characteristics.\n\n“This is a dramatic, epochal realignment of wealth in Asia. Capital moves as quickly as it can to the safest destinations with the highest rate of return. In Asia, that place is increasingly Singapore,” says Drew Thompson, visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.\n\nThe change on the ground in Singapore is palpable. Property deals by mainland buyers are the dominant transaction and the international schools are bursting at the seams, with hundreds of Chinese applicants for a vanishingly small number of places. Chinese Michelin-starred restaurants might — just — be able to find diners an available dinner booking next April.\n\nSingapore’s status as an Asian financial hub has been doubly enhanced by the Chinese influx. The number of Chinese family funds in Singapore has soared from a handful a few years ago to an estimated 600 today. At the same time, some 500 Chinese businesses have registered in the city in the past year, preparing to use their Singapore-based status to venture more boldly into India and other jurisdictions where they face obstacles.\n\nThere is exponentially more business for private wealth managers and other financial services and, as the scale of activity has grown, it has made sense for many of the largest US, European and Japanese investment banks to shift more of their senior staff to Singapore from Hong Kong.\n\n“I think many mainland China clients still see Singapore as a safer long-term bet than Hong Kong for a few reasons. First is political stability, second is economic stability and finally, its rising status as Asia’s financial hub,” says Kia Meng Loh, co-head of private wealth and family office practices at Dentons Rodyk, a law firm.\n\nBut for all the signals that Singapore has found itself in a prime position to thrive amid geopolitical uncertainty, the story has distinct vulnerabilities. China’s tolerance of what has been happening — the exodus of capital and individuals — will eventually have a breaking point that may come with consequences.\n\nSingaporean society could also push back, warn senior figures close to its government. The cost of living has soared in Singapore, angering locals who see danger and division in the rising rents, the bursting schools and the growing number of Rolls-Royces. Meanwhile, the inflow of so much capital so quickly also exposes Singapore to the potential for bad actors using it as a spot to hide money.\n\n“Capital is always moving. And it, and the people controlling it, can just as easily flow back out,” says one investment banker based in the city.\n\nSingapore has been a hub for Chinese migration and capital since it was first declared a freeport by Sir Stamford Raffles in the 19th century. Roughly three-quarters of Singapore’s 3.5mn citizens are ethnically Chinese, making it culturally an easy fit for the newest arrivals.\n\n“Chinese money has always had a significant role to play in Singapore’s economy, even before Singapore became the Singapore we know today,” says Yinglan Tan, head of Insignia Ventures, a Singapore-based venture capital fund with many Chinese backers.\n\nThat appeal has grown during the pandemic. As China sealed itself off from the world, employed harsh lockdown measures and cracked down on wealth as part of a “common prosperity drive”, some in mainland China looked overseas.\n\nAs many parts of the world, particularly the west, have become more wary of Chinese investment and business, Singapore’s neutrality, stability, low taxes and low corruption makes it an obvious choice.\n\nInvestment migration consultancy Henley & Partners has had a significant spike in migration inquiries from Chinese nationals in 2022, which are up 83 per cent by end of November compared to the full year 2021. In the top two positions were Greece and Portugal, which offer “golden visas” that grant residence without having to spend time there. Singapore was in third place.\n\n“Generally in pure investment migration programmes, such as Portugal, the vast majority of people don’t move. Singapore and China are different. A lot do want to move physically,” says Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley & Partners.\n\nOne of the most obvious areas where this flow of Chinese capital can be seen is in family offices, the private wealth management firms set up for rich individuals and their relatives. If they are domiciled in Singapore, family offices qualify for tax exemptions. Coupled with the city’s stability and a globally respected financial regulator, the number of funds has exploded. Approvals are taking months as the Monetary Authority of Singapore grapples with the surge.\n\nSingapore has gone from some 50 family offices in 2018 to 700 by the end of 2021 and lawyers and wealth management advisers estimate that number reached about 1,500 by the end of 2022. IQ-EQ, an investor services firm, estimates about 40 per cent of that total are mainland Chinese.\n\nWang Jue, a 35-year-old from Chengdu in China, represents one of many of the Chinese entrepreneurs venturing overseas and choosing Singapore as a business base.\n\nWang says he shifted more assets from his Hong Kong family office to a new Singapore family office set up in 2021. The art collector and investor, who lives in China but visits Singapore frequently and owns property in the city, has more than 300 pieces from Czech artist Alphonse Mucha that he wants to set up for viewing in the metaverse.\n\n“Singapore is a choice globally, not just Chinese,” he says over a Zoom interview, with work by US artist KAWS, Japanese painter Yayoi Kusama and a Ming dynasty antique in the background. “The politics are stable, the economy is stable and finally, it is a finance centre so capital can flow easily in and out.” Singapore has not had to confront the sort of mass street protests that were seen in Hong Kong, he says.\n\nMany of those family offices go on to set up other types of structures such as offshore funds. The number of investment funds launched as part of a 2020 government scheme designed to lure money from rival low-tax jurisdictions has surged to 776 at the end of 2022 (from 470 at the end of 2021), according to figures from Singapore’s accounting authority. Called a Variable Capital Company (VCC), the vehicle is meant to attract those who traditionally looked to jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands to house assets.\n\nCaroline Lee, who advises Chinese clients with a family office in Singapore, agrees with Volek of Henley & Partners that Chinese are increasingly looking to move physically to Singapore. Opening a family office opens the door to getting a visa to live and work in Singapore, she says. “Many travel to and fro. They see Singapore as cosmopolitan. They can speak Chinese or English and it is easy to adapt.”\n\nOne of the key attractions is Singapore’s education system, seen as one of the best in the world. The vice-principal at one of the city’s large international schools says anecdotally that of the last 20 families accepted at the school half had been from China.\n\n“Often we do not even deal with the parents. We deal with the manager and what they call the ‘communicator’ — basically a translator,” the vice-principal says, speaking anonymously because of sensitivities involved. “Often one or both parents are travelling in and out of China. They pay a fortune to buy or rent a luxury unit nearby and then the kids live with the maid, the manager and the communicator.”\n\nThis is borne out in real estate data, which show two strong years of property purchases in Singapore by mainland Chinese. According to government data, Chinese citizens bought 1,738 flats in 2021, which was 50 per cent higher than in 2019 and the most since 2012. Purchases were slightly lower, but still a historically high 1,314 units in 2022.\n\nPrivate residential property rents hit a record high in 2022, surpassing the previous peak in 2013, according to Urban Redevelopment Authority data — the last time Chinese mainlanders were heavily buying Singaporean residential property.\n\n“What our agents are telling me is that they are expecting more sales with the reopening of China,” says Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research from OrangeTee & Tie, a property research consultancy. “This past year a large portion have been luxury buyers. Once China relaxes we are expecting more buyers in even suburban areas.”\n\n“A lot of mainland buyers that have become Singapore citizens or permanent residents are buying units in bulk,” she adds. Singaporeans and permanent residents avoid higher stamp duty fees on property purchases — the tax for foreign buyers was lifted from 20 to 30 per cent in 2021 to cool the market.\n\nAll of this together has put Singapore in an enviable position globally as an international wealth hub. A record S$448bn ($339bn) in asset management inflows was recorded in 2021, 15.7 per cent higher than the previous year, the latest data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore show. By comparison, net fund inflows in Hong Kong for asset management for 2021 was HK$1.514tn ($194bn), compared with HK$1.379tn in 2020, according to the city’s Securities and Futures Commission.\n\nThat realignment of wealth has brought tantalisingly closer the city’s long-held ambition of being a deeper and self-sustaining financial hub.\n\n“The thing that Covid did for Singapore was that prior to the crisis it really struggled to have that community of finance professionals to the extent that it became self-sustained. Now the flow is here. The decision makers are here. Walking distance from my office I can meet lawyers, asset managers, portfolio managers, someone running a family office, someone wealthy wanting to set up a family office. Prior to the pandemic it wasn’t as deep,” says Michael Marquardt, Asia chief executive of IQ-EQ, an investor services firm that sets up family offices.\n\nAt a time of intense geopolitical rivalry between the west and China, Singapore remains open and welcoming of both.\n\n“You can be Chinese, come here and eat Chinese and do business and have a network. If you are from New York, you can come here, eat your food, do business and have a network,” Marquardt adds.\n\nSingapore has also stolen important conferences from under Hong Kong’s nose. SuperReturn Asia, Asia’s leading private capital conference, last year was held in Singapore for the first time and attracted large companies and investors from all over the world, including China.\n\n“When Singapore wants something, the whole machine gets behind it. Singapore Venture Capital Association co-hosted [the event], Singapore Tourism Board provided sponsorship, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and other agencies provided content, the sovereign [investors] were supportive and spread the word,” says Shane Chesson, a founding partner of Singapore’s Openspace Ventures who was involved in moving the conference location.\n\n“They’ve played a blinder but they also move quickly and don’t squander the opportunity,” he adds.\n\nStill, many in Singapore hesitate to say the shift is permanent. If rich Chinese feel that the current level of repression is lessening, that could reduce the number of people seeking an exit. But even more worrying, say experts, is the potential for Beijing to look at Singapore’s welcome to China’s wealthy and their accompanying flows of capital and seeing it as an opportunity to extend its influence.\n\n“You run the risk of China being covetous of Singapore as a Chinese outpost. The more Sinicised and mainland it becomes, the more it could be seen as a part of greater China,” says Thompson. “It is an existential risk.”\n\nThe other issue Singapore’s ruling party is grappling with is the impact on the city’s carefully managed societal mix. The government for instance sets ethnic quotas in public housing — where about 80 per cent of Singaporeans live — as a way of trying to ensure racial and religious harmony.\n\nCracks are emerging. The conversations among wealthy — and aspiring wealthy — Singaporeans and other parts of its establishment regularly turn to complaints about the new Chinese nationals building “enclaves” or “mini Chinatowns” in certain neighbourhoods.\n\nBut the clearest indication of unhappiness among the local population is the cost of living, and especially rising rents. According to data from the URA, rents for private homes surged 8.6 per cent in the third quarter, which was the steepest growth since 2007. Rents for private apartments, dominated by foreigners and expats, and government-subsidised housing, where most citizens live, are soaring.\n\n“The government was quite happy for people to blame Hong Kong expats. But it has become pretty clear that while that was a contributing factor, the real reason for the eye-popping prices has been the Chinese buyers, many of whom are willing to pay double the asking rent, or pay millions in cash for properties that sit empty,” says one real estate agent.\n\nThere is a concern that at some point the Singapore authorities will face ever louder complaints from the middle class, and, potentially, from the thousands of foreign professionals living and working there. If the quality of life changes, a lot of that wealthy capital might move on, experts warn.\n\nIn this respect, Hong Kong’s swift transformation under a new national security law and its loss of business and people due to Covid restrictions offers a cautionary tale for Singapore on how quickly a city’s fortunes can change.\n\nSingapore, sums up Simon Tay, chair of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, is in a sweet spot as globalisation slows.\n\n“In a world where China is looking for friends, it gets a warm reception in Singapore. At the same time, Wall Street and US companies increasingly see us as a premium alternative to other hubs,” he says.\n\n“There is much to navigate and all depends on not having to make a choice [between the west and China], because that would force Singapore to destroy value. Cold wars are all about value destruction.”",

    "date": "2023-01-1200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Sotheby’s starts 2023 with a £20mn bang, in the form of Gerhard Richter’s four metre-wide, two-part “Abstraktes Bild” (1986), which it will offer in London on March 1. The work is being sold from an American collection, which acquired it for $9.7mn in 2007 (£4.7mn), then a record for a Richter abstract.\n\nThe German artist’s prices have continued to rise, with recent records for his Colour Charts, Clouds and Seascapes paintings, though his abstracts are still the most prized internationally — eight out of 10 of Richter’s priciest works are those, like the Sotheby’s work, made with his trademark squeegee, a tool traditionally used to clean windows.\n\nThese include his top price of £30.4mn ($46.3mn), made for another 1986 work in 2015. “He is on the top of every auctioneer’s wish list,” says James Sevier, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art for Europe. The work is guaranteed to sell and starts its tour in Miami this weekend.\n\nIn April, Berlin’s Neue Nationalgalerie opens a show of 100 of Richter’s works, while David Zwirner gallery, which recently took over the commercial representation of the 90-year-old artist, promises a solo exhibition in New York in March.\n\nArt market players were surprised by the cancellation of Masterpiece, the mixed-category fair founded in 2010 that had grown to be a welcome addition to London’s summer season of smart events. The UK’s inflationary and post-Brexit environment created a “harsh commercial reality”, says chief executive Lucie Kitchener. She cites staffing struggles in the wider hospitality industry and says that, since Brexit, the fair’s European exhibitors had more than halved from 38 in 2018 to 16 last year.\n\nThe fair proved to be one too many for MCH Group, which took full ownership of Masterpiece just five months ago, up from its 67.5 per cent investment in 2017. The company also runs the four Art Basel events, its priority art brand. While MCH specifies only that the 2023 Masterpiece fair has been cancelled, there is no sense that it will come back.\n\nTo Kitchener’s credit, and in a crowded field, Masterpiece did something right. Robert Travers, founder of the 20th-century art gallery Piano Nobile, is one of many longtime exhibitors to praise the fair, particularly its 2022 edition, where “there was one billionaire after another”, he says. Perhaps for another organiser, there’s a summer opportunity ahead.\n\n“Everybody has flown in for the first time in three years,” enthused Emi Eu, director of Singapore’s STPI gallery at the opening of her city’s newest fair, Art SG, which runs until Sunday. Her international counterparts were also pleased to be among the 160 galleries testing the south-east Asian art market in the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre.\n\nMany had committed to the fair back in 2019, but first logistical and then Covid-related problems delayed its opening, during which time Singapore gained an influx of wealthy inhabitants from Asia’s more Covid-restricted countries, including China.\n\n“In some ways, Singapore was a net beneficiary of Covid,” notes Nick Simunovic, director of Gagosian in Hong Kong. His gallery’s early sales included two Ocean Chunk series works by Ashley Bickerton, who lived on the Indonesian island of Bali from 1993 until he died last year, to Jakarta’s MACAN Museum. Simunovic and others said they had brought works that were priced “invitingly”; Javier Perés, founder of Peres Projects, confirmed early sales of his more expensively priced works, at around $50,000.\n\nPatti Wong, who recently left Sotheby’s after more than three decades, latterly as its senior international chair, has set up her own art advisory business for Asia’s collectors of art and luxury items. She says the auction business has changed dramatically since the pandemic: “Overnight, Sotheby’s became a digital auction house. Automation is fantastic, but there are certain clients who need more hand-holding.”\n\nWong opens her Hong Kong-based business with Daryl Wickstrom, another Sotheby’s long-timer in Asia who left the company in 2016.\n\nWong notes the growth of Asian buyers beyond the continent in the past 10 years. “Before the pandemic, half of all the works [that Sotheby’s] offered for more than $5mn were bought or bid for by Asian collectors,” she says. This is part of the thinking behind Wong’s tie-up with the London-based Fine Art Group advisory business, an investor in Patti Wong & Associates. The Fine Art Group also provides “access to capital”, which Wong says appeals to clients looking for art loans and other forms of financing.\n\nThe Natalia Cola Foundation, set up by the Ukrainian philanthropist in 2019, is organising a charity dinner and auction at London’s Royal Academy of Arts to benefit Kyiv’s National Academy of Arts of Ukraine (NAAU). Since Russia’s devastating invasion last year, the museum has lost most of its local support, the foundation and museum say.\n\nThe fundraiser will go towards necessary repairs to the building and will directly support Ukrainian artists. “Russia’s policies and atrocities intend to eradicate Ukrainian identity and it is more important than ever to preserve Ukrainian art and culture in all its forms,” Cola says.\n\nThe live auction on January 28 will have nine works, with another 25 offered in a silent auction that opened this week. Artists who have donated work include Tracey Emin and Antony Gormley, while Juergen Teller has given a photograph taken while he was in Ukraine, “Kiev No 1” (2007), with a starting bid of £10,000.\n\nThe country’s own artists Boris Mikhailov and Pavlo Makov — the latter represented Ukraine at last year’s Venice Biennale — also feature. Kyiv-born Cola, who studied art history at a branch of the NAAU, says she hopes to raise £250,000.\n\nsaveukraineculture.com\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow @ftweekend on Twitter",

    "blurb": "Dual initial public offering expected to raise as much as $1bn as interest grows in food security investment",
    "date": "2023-01-1000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Olam Group, one of the world’s biggest agricultural commodity traders, will list its $3.5bn agricultural arm in Singapore and potentially Saudi Arabia as concerns around the war in Ukraine and climate change spur investment in food security.\n\nThe Singapore-based trader, which sold a 35 per cent stake in Olam Agri to a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund last year for $1.24bn, said on Tuesday that the dual listing of the company was designed to help expand its business outside of Asia.\n\nOlam Agri is looking to raise between $800mn and $1bn for the listing in the first half of the year, according to two people familiar with the deal. The company, which supplies global brands from Nestlé to Unilever, also counts Japan’s Mitsubishi and Singaporean state investment company Temasek as its backers.\n\nThe initial public offering comes as Saudi Arabia is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels into sectors including agriculture.\n\nClimate change and the war in Ukraine are set to keep food prices at higher levels than before the Covid-19 pandemic, even as wholesale food costs have stabilised in recent months.\n\nChief executive Sunny Verghese on Tuesday said investors were increasingly concerned about global food security. “What the Russia-Ukraine war has brought into sharp relief is that as the world balkanizes and polarises . . . global output including food and feed production, can get upended,” he said.\n\nOlam Agri is a supplier and processor that links farmers — particularly from frontier and emerging markets in Asia and Africa — with global brands.\n\nThe listing is part of a reorganisation of the Singapore-listed Olam Group to split into three new entities. Verghese said there was no change to the plan to list its food ingredients business on the London Stock Exchange with a secondary listing in Singapore. The executive said it would happen after the Olam Agri listing was completed and when market conditions improved.\n\nNirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and internet research at Aletheia Capital, said: “Efforts to spin off [the Olam Agri] business ticks boxes in a world where people [are] valuing food security and high environmental, social and governance standards.”\n\nThe company is “viewed as proxy for commodity or food prices going up,” he said, though he added that a number of global investors were not set up to trade in the Saudi stock market.\n\n“The Saudis have been investing in the business for a while, and it fits into the government’s plans to diversify and get exposure to businesses that are ESG-friendly but also serve its specific interests,” he said.\n\nIn response to questions about why it was pursuing a primary listing in Saudi Arabia as well as Singapore, Verghese said the Saudi exchange raised a lot of money in 2021 and 2022, making it an exception to other global equity markets last year.\n\n“As the first foreign company to list there, we can tap into this additional incremental discrete pool of new capital,” he said.",

    "event_name": "Alphabet’s Verily seeks to eradicate dengue in Singapore",
    "blurb": "Bid to extend tech throughout city state to wipe out disease-carrying mosquito population ",
    "date": "2023-01-0800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore could become the first dengue-free country in the tropics, according to Alphabet’s life sciences unit Verily — if the government decides to use its technology across the city state to tackle the mosquito-borne disease.\n\nDengue claims 300mn victims each year, with 90mn serious cases and tens of thousands of deaths, the majority being children. In Singapore, cases have surged this year, with the average weekly number as of early December being 20 per cent higher than normal, according to the National Environment Agency.\n\nBut in some residential neighbourhoods where the NEA and Verily have run field trials, it is a different story. Verily’s tech fights dengue-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the release of other facility-bred Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes. The NEA has reported up to 98 per cent suppression of the Aedes aegypti population and an 88 per cent reduction in dengue cases after at least one year of releases under Project Wolbachia, which Verily joined in 2018.\n\n“We could make Singapore the first dengue-free country in the tropics,” said Linus Upson, who leads Verily’s Debug Project out of California and previously worked at Google. “We are making sure our [island-wide] proposal is scientifically and economically sound . . . and will make a proposal to [the Singapore government] in the next couple of months.”\n\nProjects to sterilise insects have been around for decades and Verily has trialled the technology elsewhere, such as in California, but high density Singapore is seen as a particularly ambitious opportunity to test a whole country.\n\nCompanies, including resorts and hotels in hot, tropical locations could eventually be customers of the tech — though concerns remain about environmental impact, with the insects being pollinators that affect plant growth. There are also doubts over whether poorer governments in south-east Asia could afford to replicate wealthy Singapore’s project.\n\nAedes aegypti is the primary vector that drives dengue transmission in Singapore and can also carry the yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika viruses.\n\nThe key to eradicating it is using Wolbachia — common bacteria that occur naturally in 50 per cent of insect species — for suppression. Verily’s highly automated facility in Singapore and team of scientists, engineers and specialists rear mosquitoes, sort them according to sex and then release males to mate with wild females. Verily’s males have Wolbachia, while wild Aedes aegypti females do not, making them incompatible. The females lay eggs, but they never hatch.\n\n“The concept is quite interesting because they are adding to the overall number of mosquitoes to bring the population down. It has worked here and other places though we need to work out if the overall benefit is worth the environmental impact and the cost,” said one science professor based in the city state, asking to speak anonymously because it is a government project.\n\nOther projects that do not focus on suppression have also had success. The World Mosquito Program, working in 12 countries from Australia to Brazil and Fiji, rears and releases Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes weekly over a period of up to 20 weeks. After one year, the wild population of the target area becomes infected, with the bacteria able to block the replication of viruses including dengue.\n\n“We effectively immunise them,” said Cameron Simmons, the World Mosquito Program’s director of global implementation and director of the Institute of Vector-Borne Diseases at Monash University. There were not more or fewer mosquitoes with the WMP method, he said. It also did not need to be repeated and did not require huge industrial and automated facilities.\n\nWMP’s trial in Yogyakarta in Indonesia showed a 77 per cent reduction in dengue cases and an 86 per cent reduction in dengue hospitalisations in Wolbachia-treated areas compared with untreated areas.\n\n“High-income countries such as Singapore or states in the US can afford the male mosquito method used by Verily. But in cities such as Jakarta, Bangkok or Ho Chi Minh, both the mosquito and human population are much higher, making it more difficult and expensive. [That technology] has not been proven at scale,” Simmons added. “We don’t solve the problem of people being bitten. The mosquitoes are still there, but we solve the health problem.”\n\nProponents argue that suppression techniques are still cheaper than the public health cost over the long term. Research by the NEA put the economic impact of dengue at between $1bn to $2.2bn between 2010 and 2020.\n\nUpson agreed there was an environmental impact to any interference but said the problem of invasive species of mosquito such as aedes aegypti — which is not native to south-east Asia — had become ever more serious for governments and health systems.\n\nThe cost of Verily’s programme in Singapore “would be less than the direct healthcare costs of dengue”, he argued.",

    "date": "2023-01-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "In Singapore, the state has invested heavily in the arts. Although this has been a boon to local artists in many ways, it has mostly involved support for museum institutions and large-scale events such as fairs and biennales.\n\n“In Singapore, the state is always a participant, either as an invisible co-curator or co-commissioner or as a more active agent,” says Singaporean artist Jason Wee, founder of independent outfit Grey Projects. “What is sorely lacking are small- and medium-sized spaces, where artists, curators, and directors can develop projects and relationships under different conditions.”\n\nGrey Projects is one of a handful of spaces challenging the bureaucratic matrix of the city’s state-led art scene. “Museums aren’t the be-all space of art,” says Wee.\n\nStarch established itself in 2021 as a flexible gallery that would adapt and morph depending on artists’ needs. “When I was offered a large space,” says founder Moses Tan, “the original idea was to first commit to a one-year programme, with each month given to artists to experiment or workshop in or to put up an exhibition.” This has carried on for a second year and there are no plans to stop.\n\nTan, an artist himself, was inspired by spaces such as Supernormal in Singapore, Hidden Space in Hong Kong, Speedy Grandma in Bangkok and some artist-run initiatives in Australia. He has also collaborated with Grey Projects on programming around queer art. But instead of following the blueprint of other galleries, Tan tried to understand their ethos and the part they played in the bigger art system. “It led me to consider how I could also contribute to an organic framework with Starch, to hopefully support the arts with kindness and flexibility,” he says.\n\nOne project Tan is particularly proud of is Inheritance of Parts, a 2021 installation-based group show inspired by Kuo Pao Kun’s play Descendants of the Eunuch Admiral. He says the show was “maximalist while thoughtful in its considerations of display and performance”.\n\nThis year’s art week is a busy one. The space will host a show titled Nighthawks, curated by artist Jeremy Sharma, made up of works on the theme of “expanded cinema”, which is part of a collaboration with nearby design studio Supper House. Starch will also be participating in talks and performances.\n\nstarch.sg\n\nIndependent non-profit space Seed aims to push the boundaries of art from south-east Asia. It was founded in 2019 by Ivy Lam, Lourdes Samson and Connie Wong, all graduates of the MA course in Asian art history at the Lasalle College of the Arts in Singapore. Wong cites London-based Parasol Unit and Hong Kong’s Para Site as among the trio’s inspiration.\n\n“We are seeding new ideas, new artistic approaches and new audiences, allowing the platform to be more open to different art projects,” says Samson. An exhibition which shaped the direction of the space was Work in Progress: Video Art from Southeast Asia. “This was one of the few shows in Singapore that featured video as an important medium used by south-east Asian artists.”\n\nLocated in a gallery in the River Valley area (until February, when its lease expires and it will have to move), Seed has occasionally expanded into larger exhibition venues on a project basis, including Gillman Barracks, Tanjong Pagar Distripark and The Substation. “We realise that Seed is not specific to a location,” says Lam.\n\nFrom January 8 to February 4, Seed will present The Garden by Singapore artist Ernest Chan — who was the first artist to exhibit in the space, back in 2019 — and will feature paintings, drawings and ceramic sculptures reflecting on the connections between humans and nature.\n\nseedartspace.com\n\nOver its 15 years, the artist-run Grey Projects has grown to encompass two galleries, a library, a studio and a residency apartment. The residency programme has given Grey Projects a reputation for research-led international artistic exchanges, as well as experimental curatorship.\n\nWee, who was inspired by earlier Singaporean artist-run experiments such as Plastique Kinetic Worms and Lee Wen’s Independent Archive, founded Grey Projects as a home for nonconformist art, including queer art, when the field was ostracised in Singapore. Today it has expanded to encompass a variety of artists, including performance artist Amanda Heng, who recently had a show there exploring interpersonal communication in urban environments.\n\nDuring Singapore Art Week Grey Projects will be showing the sound and video works of Seo Hye-Soon as part of a partnership with MMCA Seoul. It is also about to launch the next edition of Walk Walk Don’t Run, its open-studio art tours.\n\nAt the end of July, Wee will take a break from public programming in Singapore, saying that “it’s time to make space for others”. He also has a multiyear project of his own to focus on. “I am an artist and a writer in the end,” he says. “But it’s not the end of Grey Projects yet, we have a few more projects down the line.”\n\ngreyprojects.org",

    "date": "2023-01-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Richard Koh emerged from the pandemic with a realisation: the world had changed and so had he. With that guiding him, the south-east Asian gallerist started making some changes in his own life. First he shook up his stable of represented artists, cutting the number from more than 20 by nearly half.\n\n“It lifted a lot of weight off. If someone claims to have not been damaged even in whatever small way during the pandemic then I don’t think they are human,” he says over tea in Singapore. “It is the same with the art world: if they haven’t changed, it is going to be tough. We are working with artists with interesting things to say.”\n\nIt is fitting then that Art SG, the biggest art fair to launch in Asia Pacific in a decade, is in Singapore. Koh says the city-state is itself transformed after the pandemic: it became a hub for summits, conferences and exhibitions as Hong Kong remained shut with crippling pandemic restrictions, to the point where there is a buzz in Singapore that did not exist before the crisis.\n\nThat buzz has flowed through to broader south-east Asia, Koh’s home and a region of 675mn with Singapore nestled in the centre. New buyers, new artists and new buying patterns are emerging. All of this, he hopes, will be on display at Art SG. His gallery, Richard Koh Fine Art, will join 150 others at the major new art fair, which was delayed for nearly four years because of the pandemic. The show was postponed in 2019 to 2020 after participants requested more time, then the pandemic struck and its debut was delayed three more times.\n\nThe 57-year-old, a longtime supporter and promoter of south-east Asian contemporary art, says another change has been a shift towards localisation. Art buyers and collectors, unable to fly to international art fairs while the pandemic raged, started looking more deeply at local artists, especially in Vietnam and Thailand, he says.\n\n“Covid, the war [in Ukraine], geopolitical tensions between the US and China . . . under the facade there is a sense now that local is better,” he says. “Younger buyers in the region are coming in. The buying pattern is different. The visual language appreciation is different. The idea of collecting is different. They are collecting their time. Many of these buyers are from a social media generation, drawn to visual work that is fast, colourful and even virtual.” For this reason, he is hopeful Art SG will steer clear of being another generic international fair and that gallerists showcase more homegrown and regional art.\n\nBut art is an expensive business and south-east Asia’s developing economies often cannot afford to build the infrastructure and programmes needed to foster and promote local art, Koh says. This is part of what has driven his new artist residency programme, scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2023 and run for three months. The course will focus on cultivating new artistic talent in south-east Asia — applicants have to have been practising for less than five years — and giving them the bonus of more practical experience in the running of a gallery so they understand how it works when dealing with their own galleries. “At the moment they don’t teach this in art school and no one talks about it because selling seems to be a bad word,” he adds.\n\nThe project is self-funded and will run for three years, after which he hopes to attract sponsors. Having fairs such as Art SG that then promote these artists’ work, and carry on the momentum, is crucial, he says. Sotheby’s first sale of Modern and contemporary art in Singapore in August 2022 made S$24.5mn (US$18mn), with “strong results”, according to the auction house, for south-east Asian art.\n\nArtists from the Indochina region — which includes Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam — will feature heavily in Koh’s selection. “Underdog” isn’t the correct word, Koh insists, but he says he does gravitate towards artists who are not considered trendy and don’t have a huge platform.\n\nOne of the regional artists Koh champions is Natee Utarit, who he has worked with for 20 years. A painter from Bangkok, Utarit’s latest body of work considers the question of what would happen if history was written by the east and not the west. “A lot of western curators when they see the work, they think this is about religion. But if you understand the Asian psyche, you see a lot of the quirky things in the painting.” One painting in the Déjà Vu series shows men in Buddhist robes in a historic Greco-Roman building.\n\nAnother artist he thinks local collectors will appreciate is Vietnamese-American Trong Gia Nguyen, who is based in Brussels. Koh, who describes his personal preference for art as “contemplative”, says Nguyen’s work is political in a “quiet way”. His work at Art SG considers the concept of displacement, using both photography and painting. “Indochina citizens are everywhere from the US to France but often never fully accepted or integrated. The work subtly considers the feeling of being displaced.”\n\nVietnam in particular has many more collectors supporting local works, more galleries opening and artists practising full time, according to Koh. Another work he will feature at Art SG is an installation by Vietnamese feminist artist Cam Xanh. The work involves a giant acrylic cross and bible with phrases sandwiched between the bonded layers, referring to the burdens put on women.\n\nKoh admits that any social commentary, even through art, can be a risk in south-east Asia, a region known for authoritarian regimes and frequent clampdowns on dissenting voices. Singapore, where people require a permit to protest and sex between men was only decriminalised in 2022, has its human rights critics.\n\nStill, he is optimistic about the change wrought by the pandemic. In some ways the crisis changed life — and art — for the better, including in south-east Asia. “The good thing from this is that people looked inwards. It was a time of self-discovery. Does it move on further, deeper? I don’t know, but we have had time to understand ourselves better.”\n\nrkfineart.com",

    "date": "2023-01-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore has long played second fiddle to Hong Kong as an art-market hub in Asia. But next week a new fair, Art SG, opens in a fresh attempt to establish a major event in Singapore and cement its rising influence in the continent’s shifting art scene.\n\nSingapore’s role as an international art market centre didn’t seem to stand a chance against Hong Kong in 2011, when Art Basel announced it was acquiring ArtHK, launched four years earlier by Magnus Renfrew, who has co-founded Art SG. The relative ease of doing business in Hong Kong and the power of the Art Basel brand limited the prospects for Singapore’s fledgling rival fair, Art Stage Singapore. This began in 2011, ran relatively well despite some internal wranglings, then ended abruptly in 2019.\n\nSingapore’s time may now be coming. It has maintained its status as a haven for private wealth, particularly drawing mainland Chinese money, and as the hub market for south-east Asia’s many growing economies, including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. The geopolitical backdrop, Renfrew says, has since enhanced Singapore’s prospects.\n\n“You could say that [Art Stage] was too early. Historically, Singapore’s distance from China and its collectors was seen as a disadvantage; now it is regarded as the only neutral territory in Asia,” Renfrew says. “Singapore has had consistently positive relations with both China and the USA and . . . has been the de facto hub where constituencies from around the region can meet on equal terms.”\n\nThe new fair’s director is Shuyin Yang, who previously ran Art Central, a Hong Kong satellite fair. Yang, a Singapore native, notes too that, since the pandemic started, the city-state, which opened its borders relatively quickly after a strict lockdown, has witnessed an influx of wealthy individuals from China and Indonesia, particularly from the technology and financial sectors. It’s helpful that Mandarin is commonly spoken in Singapore. “People thought they were sheltering temporarily during Covid, but have stayed and helped to revitalise the city,” she says.\n\nRenfrew acknowledges the growing importance of other Asian cities, notably those with strong local support, such as Seoul, where Frieze opened a fair this year, as well as Taipei and Tokyo, where he also runs fairs: Taipei Dangdai and the forthcoming Tokyo Gendai.\n\nSingapore’s cultural scene is more mature than Hong Kong’s was in 2007 — the Singapore Art Museum and the vast National Gallery Singapore are just two of its respected and well-visited institutions. The commercial sector has been more stop-start and now has less of the marked support and influence of Singapore’s government. But Yang says galleries are regaining momentum since the pandemic and are focused in two areas — Gillman Barracks and the Tanjong Pagar district around the Singapore Art Museum. In August, Sotheby’s held its first Modern and contemporary art auction in Singapore, citing a “growing collector base in the region”, making a total S$24.4mn (about US$18mn), with more sales planned for this year.\n\nThere are no official stipulations on the sort of works that can be shown, with Singapore’s authorities generally less strict than those in China when it comes to politically motivated art. “Singapore is a multicultural and multiracial society with a thriving contemporary art scene,” says Renfrew. “We have highlighted to participating galleries that it is important to keep in mind cultural sensitivities, with similar considerations to exhibiting elsewhere in Asia.” These sensitivities include nudity and profanity, according to local art-market figures.\n\nThe cultural winds might be in Singapore’s favour, but Art SG’s opening has faced turbulence. The fair’s launch was originally announced in 2018 as one of the regional fairs in a new portfolio established by MCH, the owner of Art Basel. A few months later, MCH pulled out of these events, so Renfrew stepped in to join co-owners Sandy Angus and Tim Etchells. MCH Group then reinvested in the fair (it now owns 15 per cent), seemingly hedging its bets in Asia, though its management has described its investment as “additive” to Hong Kong rather than an alternative.\n\nArt SG’s inaugural event was planned for November 2019 but participating galleries then reportedly asked for more time to prepare, so the fair was pushed back to January 2020 — then Covid struck. Such pent-up planning might partly account for the 2023 fair’s impressive roster of more than 150 galleries. Many are international — including the likes of Gagosian, White Cube and David Zwirner — while 20 galleries with spaces in Singapore are in the mix, such as homegrown heavyweights Yavuz Gallery and STPI.\n\n“It is bittersweet that so many people have moved from China to Singapore, but it has become such a hub,” says Rachel Lehmann, co-founder of Lehmann Maupin gallery, which will be showing at Art SG. While some see the government as culturally overbearing, Lehmann finds that “it is a small country with great support. They understand the power of soft culture.” The gallerist, who started her career in Geneva and Lausanne, adds that Singapore “reminds me of Switzerland” — and doesn’t disagree when I mention their similarly friendly tax regimes.\n\nAt Art SG, the gallery’s booth will include work by the British-Malaysian artist Mandy El-Sayegh, the Vietnamese-American Tammy Nguyen and the South Korea-born Lee Bul. Lehmann’s gallery has gone one step further than just showing at the fair and has appointed Ken Tan as a director based in Singapore, though she says there are currently no plans for a formal gallery.\n\nFellow international gallerist Thaddaeus Ropac also brings work by El-Sayegh, as well as new pieces by Alvaro Barrington and Oliver Beer. Showing at a Singapore fair for the first time, he cites the might of its National Gallery as well as “a handful of very well-informed collectors” he already knows there. He is keeping his expectations in check. “It is an experiment. I doubt Singapore can be the next Hong Kong, those are big shoes to fill, but it is important to build relationships in Asia,” Ropac says.\n\nAt the fair, held in the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre, there will be additional sections for younger galleries — in business for six years or fewer — including Capsule from Shanghai and Tabula Rasa (Beijing, London). Bucking the trend away from art backed by non-fungible tokens, the fair has another section, called Reframe, with eight galleries showing digital art in its many forms. “There was arguably too much euphoric excitement [about NFTs] but the baby’s been thrown out with the bathwater. There is incredible work in digital media,” Renfrew says.\n\nYang says that digital art is also part of her mission “to make sure that the fair suits different interests . . . We are expecting a new audience, many galleries and collectors are coming to Singapore for the first time, we want them all to find areas of engagement.”\n\nThe otherwise measured Renfrew predicts an art scene about to explode. “We need to be slightly ahead of the curve, a catalyst to make it happen, that’s the role we want to play.”\n\nJanuary 12-15, artsg.com\n\nSingapore Art Week, January 6-15, artweek.sg",

    "body": "When Yeo Workshop opens its booth at the Art SG fair in Singapore next week, a painting by Burmese artist and poet Maung Day will hang there, depicting a bucolic backdrop in a delicate style that is at once surrealist, whimsical and naive. But just before the rolling hills and verdant woods is a disquieting element: a dog standing next to a corpse.\n\nCalled “Dog Found the Murdered Body of His Master on the Beach”, the acrylic painting illustrates a real-life murder that shook the fishing community in Rakhine state in Myanmar, where Maung Day used to live. The murder was part of the post-coup turmoil of recent years: on February 1 2021, the military seized power, putting an end to the democratic transition started by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party. Since then, more than 2,600 people have been killed and 13,000 arrested, according to a domestic human rights organisation.\n\nLike many other murder cases in Myanmar, the culprit behind the murder in Maung Day’s picture has not been found. “The political instability and ensuing acts of violence have been an everyday reality throughout the country over the past two years,” the artist has said.\n\nPart of a presentation by curator Louis Ho for the Singaporean gallery Yeo Workshop, the artwork highlights the tensions and violence in that region of Myanmar. Singapore Art Week, which includes Art SG, is “a timely platform to reflect on the plight of the Burmese people, especially those poor, rural, minority communities, who are most vulnerable to the violence”, says Ho. And his presentation is not the only one to highlight Burmese artists.\n\nSince elections in Myanmar in 2010 and the 2012 by-election victory of the National League for Democracy party, Burmese art had been on the rise. Private galleries, such as Art Seasons and Yavuz in Singapore and Thavibu gallery in Bangkok, and public museums, notably the National Gallery Singapore, have started exhibiting the work of Burmese artists. A 2013 exhibition organised by the Guggenheim and a 2017 show in Tokyo included many works by Burmese artists and in 2021 the Centre Pompidou in Paris dedicated a large-scale exhibition to the Burmese modernist Bagyi Aung Soe.\n\nBut the coup’s leaders brought growing domestic artistic freedom to a halt, blacklisting anti-coup artists or those who had made pro-democracy work or art dealing with sexuality. This violence added to the oppression of local ethnic and religious groups, including the Rohingya people, the Muslim minority now confined to Rakhine state and victims of a genocide by the military rulers.\n\nArtists within the country never stopped working, but they are under strict censorship and the constant threat of incarceration. Art fairs and art weeks are a good chance to see their works since they have limited possibilities to show within Myanmar or are in exile abroad.\n\nHtein Lin, a prominent painter, performer and activist who has been involved in resistance movements for decades, became a cautionary tale. He was thrown in prison last August, along with his wife Vicky Bowman, the former British ambassador, charged with breaching immigration laws. They were finally released in November in an amnesty of political prisoners.\n\n“It seems as if news of Htein Lin’s arrest was what jolted the art community in Singapore and south-east Asia [into greater awareness],” says Ho, who also curated Htein Lin’s solo show Another Spring at Richard Koh Fine Art in Singapore in 2022. At Art SG, Koh’s gallery is showcasing pieces by two Myanmar artists, Aung Ko’s “The Burmese Tiger and English Hunter” and Wah Nu’s cloud paintings.\n\nFor most artists who decided to leave the country after the 2021 coup, the challenge is to highlight the condition in Myanmar and still be subtle enough not to endanger their families back home. That’s why most of the works that will be showcased in shows and on fair booths prefer to address specific issues using symbols and ancient tales.\n\nExamples of this are the pieces at the SEA Focus fair presented by Intersections, a gallery which focuses on contemporary art from Myanmar, Singapore and France founded by Marie-Pierre Mol. She will show “Lost Children 1”, a work by Maung Day revisiting the story of how the pied piper led children to disappear — a pervasive plague in Myanmar — and “Tales (The Kiss)” by Kyaw Htoo Bala, a young Yangon-based artist who studied at the Lasalle College of the Arts. “Bala recently opened an art space in Yangon,” says Mol. “I think it’s just amazing that he managed to do this at this time. It shows the resilience of Burmese people.”\n\nBala’s almost monochromatic collage is made with a traditional paper produced only in Shan state and was inspired by the stories his grandfather told him when he was a young boy. As an adult, the artist realised these drew on the history of his family, his neighbourhood and his country. “At the moment,” says Bala, “I’m creating my own stories based on the events in my life. For instance, a piece I will show in Singapore called ‘The Kiss’ . . . was inspired by lovers who seemed unaffected by the confusing, nasty and oppressive turmoil around them.”\n\nOutside the fair, there are works that indirectly address the deeper roots of the crisis. This is the case with Burmese artist Sawangwongse Yawnghwe, who presented two pieces at the Singapore Biennale in 2022, “The Opium Parallax” and “Footnotes”. These installations explore the history and conditions surrounding the opium trade in and around Myanmar. The first consists of a suspended panel: one side presents a simplified version of the history of the opium trade, the other shows a map of the complex web of relations between drug-dealing and geopolitics.\n\nYawnghwe is a descendant of the Shan royal family, and his grandfather was the first president of the Union of Burma, the party which ruled the country from 1948 to 1962 after independence from Britain. Following his death in prison after the 1962 military coup, Yawnghwe’s family formed the resistance of the Shan State Army, before being forced into exile.\n\nYawnghwe’s artistic practice can’t help but delve into the national history: “In my work there is always the desire of going back to the roots. But as a Burmese artist my roots have been completely destroyed,” he says. “Instead of being annihilated by this realisation, I look at this as a unique chance for freedom — a way of getting into new territory of how I define myself and my work as an artist.”",

Haegue Yang sprayed rice and spices on to pulp to create textured landscapes.\n\nThe artists created these works during their residencies at STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery in Singapore, a contemporary art gallery that specialises in experimentation in the mediums of print and paper. At STPI, they were supported by an in-house team of master printers and also had access to a state of the art printmaking facility and paper mill.\n\nSTPI has hosted 125 artists since 2002. “Spice paper, cement paper, copper paper . . . We’ve had all kinds,” says Emi Eu, STPI’s Korea-born executive director, who has been at the organisation since 2001. She is credited with building STPI’s critical reputation at home and abroad.\n\nSTPI began as a state-led initiative to kick-start the local arts ecosystem, with training up local master printers as its primary goal. Now it champions innovations in the field of printmaking; owns a commercial gallery that participates in top global art fairs; and runs its own boutique fair. Called SEA Focus, it features contemporary art from south-east Asia and its fifth edition (January 6-15) takes place at portside art cluster Tanjong Pagar Distripark, with offerings from 25 galleries in a flowing, boothless format.\n\nEu had a cosmopolitan upbringing. She lived with her father’s family in Seoul as a child. When she was 13, she moved to New York to live with her mother, a prominent textile historian and embroiderer. After college, through the connection of a family friend, she worked in Venice at the Galleria d’Arte Contini for four years, then studied for a masters degree at New York University in visual arts administration, during which she did an internship in the department of prints and illustrated books at MoMA.\n\nAfter she met her husband, a freelance journalist and restaurant investor, she lived between New York and Singapore, and eventually settled in the city-state in 2000. A year later, she joined STPI as one of three staff in the gallery. What’s the headcount now? “Forty-eight. Can you believe it? When I first joined, I was the youngest. Now I look around and I’m the oldest!” She effectively took the reins of STPI when its founder, American printmaker Kenneth Tyler, left a few months after the opening because of operational disagreements. (STPI was formerly known as the Singapore Tyler Print Institute.)\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule by which she selects the artists for the residency, which offers up to five weeks’ stay. First, she gets to know their practice and has to feel confident that they can manage a project with 15 people waiting to receive their instructions. This is why STPI started inviting mid-career artists.\n\nShe is candid about the unevenness of the outcomes in the residency programme, but technical innovation isn’t STPI’s only aim. “Maybe for the south-east Asian artists, some didn’t produce visually groundbreaking work. But for many of them, it was an important starting point. When we began the residency programme in 2002, in Singapore, let alone the region, there were no other residencies,” she says. “So every project has a meaning.” Besides opening up possibilities for south-east Asian artists, she adds that STPI has helped to create a regional market for mid-range works on paper.\n\nSTPI’s reputation has grown organically. Artists who attended the residency introduced other artists, and collectors and museums took notice. MoMA came to acquire works. In 2013, after seven years of applying for a spot, STPI became the first Singapore gallery to participate in Art Basel; now it is the only one to exhibit in all three of the fair’s locations.\n\nSTPI is able to be ambitious in its programming and where it shows because of hefty government support. Part of the trifecta of flagship visual arts institutions in Singapore, which also includes the Singapore Art Museum and National Gallery Singapore, STPI received S$5.1mn (US$3.8mn) in government grants in the financial year ending March 2022. (Its operating budget for the year was S$8.4mn.)\n\nWhile SEA Focus has been the only art fair in the city during Singapore Art Week for the past four years, after Art Stage Singapore was suddenly cancelled in 2019, this January a new juggernaut is in town: Art SG, with more than 150 galleries, intended to be south-east Asia’s largest fair. Eu thinks they are complementary: “SEA Focus is not a protagonist, we are more behind the scenes, a conduit for the region’s galleries and non-profits. We offer them a platform. Art SG is about connecting galleries to buyers, which is an integral part of any ecosystem.”\n\nThis year, SEA Focus is launching a projects section called Collaborations. One of the presenting artists is Danh Vo, who will be supported by Vitamin Creative Space and M Art Foundation, both from China. The Berlin-based artist will realise a work that explores his passion for gardening.\n\nEu, who has overseen STPI’s transformation, hopes that it continues to grow with the times. “I want it to evolve and not be put in any box,” she says. “I feel like I’ve done my job to bring STPI to where it is now; the next thing to do is to pave the way for a new chapter.”\n\nstpi.com.sg, seafocus.sg",

    "body": "This article is part of a guide to Singapore from FT Globetrotter\n\nWhen Singapore is mentioned, what comes to mind are the gleaming skyscrapers of our financial district and the triple towers of Moshe Safdie’s Marina Bay Sands, along with the futuristic-looking lotus of the ArtScience Museum and the flower domes and “supertrees” — solar-powered vertical gardens — of Gardens by the Bay, all nestled within a manicured swath of the Singapore Strait.\n\nHowever, the Singapore that I know best is the bustling one of my parents and grandparents, a city of rich heritage and culture whose different areas refer not simply to topographical locations but also to character-filled enclaves of different migratory ethnic and dialect groups — along with all the accompanying food, culture, vibrant colour and ear-scorching slang.\n\nAny morning in Singapore is immediately made better by a sunrise walk or morning yoga in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the only tropical botanic garden which is a Unesco World Heritage Site. Not only is it a verdant paradise that articulates Singapore’s reputation as a garden-city — the work carried out here to research and preserve rare tropical flora and fauna native to the region is also incredibly important, not only for Singapore but all of south-east Asia.\n\nOne is truly spoiled for breakfast choices in Singapore, from a plethora of street-food options such as prata (Indian flatbread) and curry in the Thomson district, bak kut teh (a pork-rib broth) along Keppel Road (conveniently located next to the art galleries and warehouses of Tanjong Pagar Distripark), brunch boards and coffee in the smart cafés of Dempsey Hill, or if feeling indecisive, an entire smorgasbord of hawker stalls to sample in Tiong Bahru market.\n\nIf I’m feeling energetic, I’ll brave the queue for Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle in Crawford Lane. Since the stall received a Michelin star in 2016, the line can grow to astronomical proportions (the longest I’ve waited is two hours), but the al dente noodles and perfect balance of vinegar make this one of the best bak chor mee (minced meat noodles) on the island. Otherwise, I’m always happy to have nasi lemak (fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaves, usually served with sides such as sambal chilli, fried anchovies, hard-boiled egg or slivers of omelette, and chicken), from its humblest version wrapped in takeaway banana leaves to the elevated plates served at The Coconut Club in its new premises along Beach Road.\n\nWhile in central Singapore, don’t forget to visit the National Gallery Singapore, which houses the world’s largest public collection of south-east Asian art from the mid 19th century to today, showcasing the splendour and tribulations of the region’s colonial and postcolonial history. The museum building is iconic, comprising two national monuments, the City Hall and former Supreme Court, where some of the original fixtures such as the prisoner’s dock and jail cells have been preserved and are now interspersed with the country’s cultural treasures. The experience can be beautifully rounded off by an exquisite lunch at chef Julian Royer’s three-Michelin-star Odette within the same building.\n\nThe east side of Singapore — the Peranakan (Straits Chinese) district of Joo Chiat and Katong, as well as the East Coast — is indisputably our most concentrated gastronomic utopia. Not only a feast for the palate with dishes like Katong laksa (noodles in a spicy broth) and a range of Nyonya cuisine, it’s a feast for the eyes too with ornate Peranakan shophouses featuring intricate architectural motifs such as those along Koon Seng Road.\n\nThe Peranakan heritage is an intrinsic part of Singapore’s cultural identity, born from the complex fabric of generations of transcultural and interracial marriages between southern Chinese migrants and indigenous Nusantara people. If a rare invitation to visit a perfectly conserved shophouse or a Peranakan bungalow offers itself — such as the Edwardian mansion known as the “Hall of the Phoenix and Peony”, which is privately owned by a doctor and celebrates the unique late-19th/early 20th-century architecture of the Straits Settlements, while splendidly preserving Peranakan culture within its rooms — do grab the opportunity with both hands.\n\nWhile in the east, take in Singapore’s version of afternoon tea with a robust cup of teh c (Ceylon tea with evaporated milk) and one of food stall Soon Soon Huat’s deliciously flaky curry puffs. The very same curry puffs are also served in Shangri-La Hotel’s elegant lobby lounge on much fancier china plates, but sans true local atmosphere. It’s no coincidence that a number of Singapore artists, gallerists and curators reside in the east, making for a constant stream of good company and food recommendations.\n\nTowards late afternoon, Singapore’s oldest housing estate Tiong Bahru starts to come to life, with its unique blend of chic cafés, vinyl stores, bookshops and galleries mixed in with a hefty dose of old-school charm, thanks to its Streamline Moderne architecture, a late development of the Art Deco movement inspired by technology and modern travel, creating buildings with clean aerodynamic lines. As a young child, I visited my grandmother who lived in one of these walk-up apartments, and some of my earliest memories are of the dark, steep stairwell that suddenly opened up into a large airy balcony with blinding sunlight, against thick white walls designed to keep out the tropical heat, characteristic of Singapore’s prewar colonial buildings.\n\nA great place to catch the Singapore sunset is from the penthouse terrace of 67 Pall Mall, a private members’ wine club that was formerly the residence of movie magnate Runme Shaw. Offering an expansive view over Orchard Road as far as the Singapore Flyer observation wheel, the space intersperses 1920s Shanghai Art Deco with visual elements from the golden age of Asian cinema. As a lightweight, I appreciate the huge selection of over 1,000 wines by the glass, especially the white Burgundies.\n\nOtherwise I might drop into Appetite, a research and development kitchen, record bar and art gallery run by chef Ivan Brehm (who also operates fine-dining restaurant Nouri), to catch their latest talk or art exhibition, as well as one of their exquisite foie-gras-parfait tartines.\n\nDespite the vast array of dining options in Singapore, weekend restaurant-booking is often a competitive sport. Some of the places I enjoy most are those that present innovative recipes but are solidly reminiscent of Asian traditional cooking, such as the Korean-inspired French cuisine at Meta.\n\nFor late-night cocktails, one cannot do better than Jigger and Pony, currently 12th (and the highest-ranked Singapore bar) on The World’s Best Bars list. Owned by Indra Kantono and Gan Guoyi, it has become a mainstay of the creative cocktail scene in Singapore. I asked Kantono, who is an expert on Singapore’s after-hours scene, what other venues he personally enjoys. He shared that he is looking forward to the new outpost of Park90, a private members’ wine club at the Regent hotel, now with larger premises at the InterContinental devoted entirely to Italian wines.\n\nWinding down for the night, it’s always a debate whether to go for late-night comfort food such as the guilt-inducing Beach Road Scissor Cut Curry Rice, murtabak (stuffed flatbread) and the iconic sarbat tea at Bhai Sarbat Teh Tarik (great for ensuring you wake up hangover-free), beef kway teow in the Geylang red-light district or a spot of late-night shopping at Mustafa Centre in Little India. But why choose only one? This is Singapore.\n\nShuyin Yang is Fair Director of ART SG, a new international art fair launching as part of the 11th edition of Singapore Art Week, held from 6 to 15 January 2023 and presenting more than 130 art events across the city.\n\nHow would you spend your perfect day in Singapore?

    "blurb": "Financial institutions expect to lose ‘whole teams’ to private funds that will increasingly resemble hedge funds",
    "date": "2022-12-1200:00:00.0",
    "body": "A boom in mainland Chinese family offices setting up in Singapore is drawing in thousands of financial professionals, including from global investment banks, creating what some finance heads are calling a new “hedge fund” industry in the city-state.\n\nWealthy mainland Chinese moving assets out of President Xi Jinping’s China account for up to half of a rise in Singapore-based single family offices — the private wealth management firms set up for rich individuals and their relatives. Numbers have jumped nearly threefold since the coronavirus pandemic began and, according to some estimates, now total as many as 1,500.\n\n“The large family offices are trying to offer the kind of salary senior wealth professionals at private banks are paid,” said Caroline Lee, a former private banker who manages a Singapore-based single family office for a group of Chinese clients. “A lot [depends] on the individual bankers, but it might appeal to people who feel there is too much politics at a big bank.”\n\nFounders of the family offices often used the structure to secure employment visas and move their families to the city-state, recruitment professionals said. Many of the structures would historically employ family members in important positions, whether or not they had previous experience in asset management.\n\nHowever, since April this year, Singapore-based family offices have been required to hire at least two investment professionals to qualify for tax exemptions. Larger funds must have at least three.\n\nThe rules have created the incentive for a collective hiring spree of thousands of asset management, private wealth management and other banking professionals. This would make it a “lot tougher” to find talent, Lee added. “They must be willing to pay.”\n\nDerrick Tan, who left the Bank of Singapore to start up his own wealth management firm to work with single family offices last year, said “fomo” — fear of missing out — was a key driver for creating the offices.\n\n“I was asking many of them the purpose in setting up a family office, and it seemed like 20 or 30 years ago — when you listed your company because your friend or colleague listed a company,” he said.\n\n​​Kher Sheng Lee, Asia head of the Alternative Investment Management Association in Singapore, said he was seeing many more family offices hire from top banks and asset managers. They look for “individuals with specific investment focus and expertise”, he said.\n\nA Singapore-based investment banking head for a US financial institution said he had lost a number of professionals to family offices. “I know of several other [banks] where they have lost someone senior and that person has gone straight to a family office. We are probably going to see more of them taking whole teams with them.”\n\nBankers and other advisers said that although the family offices were conservative and largely focused on property and publicly listed equities, their risk appetite was likely to rise over time. Increasingly they were expected to behave like hedge funds, one said.\n\nCaught by surprise by the surging numbers of family office funds, Singapore’s government this year tightened the rules, with higher minimum capital and hiring requirements.\n\nTo qualify for tax exemptions and hiring investment professionals, applicants must commit to increasing assets under management to S$20mn (US$15mn) within a two-year period. At least 10 per cent of AUM — or $10mn, whichever is greater — must be invested locally, such as in Singaporean equities or start-ups.",

    "blurb": "FTX’s ignominious collapse leaves a sector searching for justification",
    "date": "2022-12-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "With FTX in tatters, bitcoin in abeyance and the entire fundament of crypto finance in doubt, the technology of blockchain was badly in want of an image boost. What the distributed ledger technology needed, Singapore decided, was the rhetorical skills of former UK prime minister Boris Johnson to burnish its battered image, and here he was at a glittering gathering of the blockchain industry in a five-star hotel last week.\n\nBlockchain in particular and innovation in general, Johnson explained, is always scary at first. “Humanity has been paranoid about this since the Titan Prometheus gave us the first flame,” he said, mixing classical reference and technological detail.\n\nJohnson was giving the keynote speech for the International Symposium on Blockchain Advancements to 80 or so crypto enthusiasts who had braved Singapore’s tropical thundery showers to hear his insights. It felt a fitting location for the event in the same week that Singapore’s state-owned fund Temasek was facing scrutiny for ploughing $275mn into the collapsed crypto exchange FTX after eight-months of due diligence failed to flag up any big concerns. It is clear there was never enough paranoia or fear, one nonplussed conference-goer said after an hour of Johnson’s musings on Brexit, Australian submarines and his time at the Telegraph.\n\nBeyond the free canapés and macarons, the event was hard to read as anything other than a plea from the blockchain industry to be taken seriously. Every sector is entitled to seek the endorsement of disgraced former leaders at times, but Johnson’s paeans of praise for Singapore Slings and his room at the famously expensive Raffles Hotel, delivered alongside his lauding of the potential of blockchain to a half-filled ballroom of men in suits, unsurprisingly was not the panacea for its woes.\n\nOne delegate, who gave his name as Kai and said he worked at a local crypto custodian start-up, was excited that someone “so famous” was speaking. What about Johnson’s position on digital currencies and the potential of blockchain? “Oh I don’t know about that,” Kai said with a nervous laugh.\n\nA rare female attendee admitted that she was actually a journalist mainly trying to find out how much Johnson was being paid to headline the conference.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Britain’s former prime minister jovially assured the room of “blockchain pioneers” that they were in the right place, going on to remind his audience that technology is “morally neutral”. He dwelt at length on how doctors erroneously claimed in the early days of the railways that the rattling and jolting of trains was likely to cause sexual excitement, why the City of London is “the most productive place on Earth”, and something unclear about nuclear-powered vacuum cleaners. But it was not obvious how these digressions would bolster his case for blockchain.\n\nHe did eventually circle back to the technology and cryptocurrencies. He said he has “seen some pretty shocking headlines about this whole venture and we need some way of holding people to account”. But no sooner had he raised the subject of recent events in the cryptosphere than he moved swiftly on to topics closer to his heart: Brexit, the Ukraine war and green technology.\n\nThen came his finale. “I will make a strong argument that the UK will become even more attractive as a place to invest once we deliver on all that Brexit stuff.” On blockchain, he added, he could not comment further without more details.\n\nThe blockchain enthusiasts seemed less than enthused. Someone showed enough interest to snap a photo only to be admonished by a man who rushed over hissing there was to be no photography.\n\nThe interviewer tried valiantly to bring Johnson back to blockchain. What was his overall message for innovators in the industry? “Apart from Singapore, which is a fantastic place for innovation, come to London. Come to the UK . . . It’s a fantastic country . . . it rains more in Rome by the way,” he replied. “I look forward to watching the progress of the blockchain industry with fascination,” he added to bemused applause.\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com",

    "blurb": "Blank-cheque companies in Asian financial hubs show little results",
    "date": "2022-11-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore and Hong Kong start-ups are sidestepping their home stock exchanges to merge with special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) in the US, as fundraising vehicles in the Asian financial hubs have yielded little on their exit plans.\n\nInformation from financial data provider Refinitiv shows that at least nine Singapore and Hong Kong companies this year have announced plans to go public with Spacs listed in the US, despite the cities offering a number of these shell companies since the first quarter — none of which has merged successfully with a target business.\n\nSpacs, also known as blank-cheque companies, provide promising companies with an alternative way of going public. They raise capital through an initial public offering then acquire or merge with an existing business, bringing the target to public markets without having to go through the traditional — and time-consuming — process of listing.\n\nThis usually means a more straightforward and quicker path for companies to go public, as Spacs offer the means to skirt an often-arduous vetting process associated with traditional IPOs.\n\nAmerican stock exchanges have received plenty of attention from investors over the high volume of Spac activity generated in the past few years, catching the eye of bourses in Asia that want to ride the wave.\n\nRefinitiv’s data showed that across the Asia-Pacific region, at least 28 Spac deals have been announced in the first nine months of this year worth a total of $23.4bn. However, none of them involved Spacs from the Singapore or Hong Kong exchanges.\n\n“With Spacs in Singapore and Hong Kong, I think we are a little bit late to the whole overall theme,” said Michael Wu, senior equity analyst at investment research company Morningstar. “The other implication would be just more generally [that] the IPO in the primary market has been quite challenging over the last year and that will likely persist.”\n\nMany Spac deals have favoured high-flying upstarts in the tech space, with such companies seen as having high growth potential, which naturally excites investors. This segment of business deals boomed in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, as tech companies saw a surge in demand for digital services when people were in lockdown.\n\nSponsors of Spacs — many of which are venture capital outfits — typically receive investor support based on their reputation, as backers do not know what target a blank-cheque company will eventually merge with.\n\nBy backing Spacs, investors have the opportunity to buy stakes in lucrative tech start-ups as they go public. One prominent example is the listing of Singapore ride-hailing and food delivery unicorn Grab in December last year. Grab merged with a Nasdaq-listed Spac called Altimeter Growth.\n\nBut as some investors discover, bets on Spacs do not always pay off as handsomely as they would like. Grab’s introduction in the US market via a Spac, for instance, saw its shares dive nearly 21 per cent at the end of trade on the first day. Its market capitalisation was about $34.6bn as trading closed, falling short of the $40bn expected by Altimeter and underlining the risks investors take when betting on big tech names that do not live up to their promise.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine this year has contributed to geopolitical instability, soaring energy and food prices, and monetary tightening by several central banks to rein in inflation. This has been bad news for Spacs, as in times like these investors tend to shy away from the risky bets associated with tech start-ups that grow quickly but, such as Grab, sacrifice steady profits to do so.\n\nRefinitiv’s data showing $23.4bn worth of Spac deals in the Asia-Pacific region in the first three quarters of this year seemed large but was still a 47.6 per cent decline in value from a year ago.\n\nAnish Ailawadi, global head of investment banking practice at analytics company Acuity Knowledge Partners, noted that “the golden period” for Spac IPOs and mergers — mainly during the first half of 2021 — has passed, with flagging interest in the region also reflecting the global scenario.\n\nAilawadi noted as well that the minimum market capitalisation in the US for Spacs is lower than in Hong Kong and Singapore, which have set more stringent benchmarks, leading smaller companies to merge with blank-cheque companies in America.\n\nThe minimum requirement is $127mn for Hong Kong Spacs and $106mn for their Singapore counterparts, compared with a minimum of $50mn for a Nasdaq listing and $100mn for a New York Stock Exchange listing in US.\n\n“Valuations in the US are generally higher than in Asian markets. Most private companies prefer US-based Spacs over those from other regions,” Ailawadi told Nikkei Asia. “Similarly, US-listed companies attract better analyst coverage, which translates into higher institutional investor interest.”\n\nHong Kong’s Hypebeast, a digital media and ecommerce company, announced its plans for Nasdaq in April by signalling its intent to merge with Iron Spark I Spac to the tune of $221.8mn — the sole player from Hong Kong to do so via a blank-cheque company this year, Refinitiv’s data showed. Hypebeast opted for a dual listing, with its other presence on the Hong Kong bourse.\n\nThe data showed that Singapore had eight counterparts unveil similar Spac plans — seven on Nasdaq and one on the NYSE. In August, for instance, financial technology platform Seamless Group announced a deal valued at $400mn with an NYSE-listed Spac called InFinT Acquisition.\n\nMore recently, the city-state’s Asia Innovations Group (ASIG), which operates a platform designed for mobile gaming and ecommerce, announced in late September it would combine with NYSE-listed Magnum Opus Acquisition — a deal representing a total equity valuation of $2.5bn and billed as the largest consumer-internet Spac merger of the year to date.\n\n“The proposed merger will combine the best of macro growth in emerging markets and the benefits of being a publicly listed company in the US to transform ASIG into a global mobile powerhouse,” said ASIG chief executive Andy Tian. “ASIG has built a unique, well-diversified global business in the core verticals of social, games, ecommerce and payments.”\n\nMeanwhile, Asia’s key financial hubs have been keeping a low profile as America continues to scoop up tech players, even though the fervour for Spacs has cooled.\n\nIn Singapore, after an initial burst of three Spac IPOs in January, the exchange has seen no such further listings in 2022. In Hong Kong, Aquila Acquisition and Vision Deal HK Acquisition are blank-cheque companies that have listed, with more than 10 others reportedly seeking a place on the hub’s bourse.\n\nAs the year draws to a close, investors still have no clear view of what companies will eventually be acquired by these Spacs, if any. Spacs in Singapore must complete a merger or acquisition within 24 months of the IPO date, with an extension of 12 months possible.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Spacs should announce a deal or de-Spac transaction within 24 months, or complete the de-Spac within 36 months, with a six-month extension possible.\n\nPeggy Mak, portfolio manager at fund management outfit Haven Capital, reckoned it is highly possible that some of the Singapore and Hong Kong Spacs could miss the two-year deadline.\n\n“The global economic environment has clouded all markets, hence Spacs in both markets are not spared,” she told Nikkei. “As the [deadline] draws near, they might lower their standard for a target, which makes it worse.”\n\nMak stressed that most Spac targets are growth companies that continue to show a negative operating cash flow — performance that investors are shunning due to rising interest rates and recession risks.\n\n“The number of Spacs globally might have outpaced the number of companies looking to be listed. There is still the overarching concern about the tech sector and growth companies, hence we do not expect much enthusiasm even with a de-Spac announcement.”\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on November 21 2022. ©2022 Nikkei Inc.

    "date": "2022-11-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s Temasek has launched a review of its $275mn investment in FTX as the state-owned investment fund is scrutinised over the due diligence it performed before backing Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange.\n\nLawrence Wong, Singapore’s deputy prime minister, told parliament on Wednesday that Temasek’s losses were “disappointing” and had caused reputational damage for the city-state.\n\nTemasek earlier this month wrote off its investment in FTX, which constituted 0.09 per cent of its S$403bn (US$295bn) portfolio but provided the crypto group with a seal of approval from a major fund manager. In response to queries by the Financial Times, the fund had defended its “eight-month due diligence” process but earlier this month admitted its trust in former chief executive Bankman-Fried appeared “misplaced”.\n\nTemasek’s inquiry comes as filings by FTX’s new management in US bankruptcy court point to a severe lack of financial controls at a group that was once valued at $32bn by a roster of big-name investors that also includes venture capital firm Sequoia and Japan’s SoftBank.\n\nConfidence in Singapore’s ability to regulate the digital assets industry has been undermined by a series of crypto failures connected to the city-state this year, including the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto platform Hodlnaut. Singaporean police said last week it was investigating the platform and its directors “for possible cheating and fraud offences”.\n\nThe city-state’s sovereign wealth fund GIC is also facing pressure as an investor of crypto broker Genesis. Genesis said following FTX’s collapse earlier this month that it had about $175mn in funds locked in an account on the platform. Several days later, Genesis paused withdrawals at its lending unit, citing “unprecedented market turmoil”.\n\nThe fallout over FTX and the losses incurred by retail investors have resulted in unusual public criticism of Temasek, with many questioning its due diligence. Singapore users accounted for the second-largest share of web traffic to FTX.com, accounting for about 5 per cent of traffic share, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\n“It was a moonshot investment, but Temasek looks silly for pushing the line they did eight months of due diligence. They should have just said we took a punt, it didn’t work out, and we are sorry,” said one major investor in the private equity space.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Saturday, Ho Ching, the former Temasek chief executive who is the wife of Singapore’s leader, Lee Hsien Loong, called the fund’s loss “egg on our face”. But she defended the investor’s overall strategy, saying “some of Temasek’s best investments were made by being contrarian”.\n\nWong, who also serves as Singapore’s finance minister, said on Wednesday in response to questions from members of parliament that FTX’s collapse would have a limited impact on the city-state’s broader financial system.",

    "blurb": "More businesses are ‘Singapore-washing’ as US-China relations deteriorate",
    "date": "2022-11-3000:00:00.0",
    "body": "As many as 500 Chinese companies have quietly redomiciled or registered in Singapore over the past 12 months in a bid to hedge against rising geopolitical risk as tensions between Beijing and Washington escalate.\n\nThey follow online fast-fashion retailer Shein, electric vehicle maker Nio and IT services provider Cue, who were among the first to switch parent companies or global headquarters to Singapore, list on the stock exchange, acquire local businesses and form joint ventures in the city state.\n\nChinese businesses setting up in Singapore is not a new phenomenon, but senior bankers say there is now an “acute” rush by mainland groups to establish holding companies to future-proof their businesses as the west steps up its scrutiny of corporate China.\n\nThe exact number of Chinese companies being set up is unclear because Singapore does not disclose origin country in its public statistics. However, one lawyer said his firm’s internal research division found more than 500 new Chinese companies had set up this year in Singapore, which experts noted was a rise from previous years.\n\nAnother business advisory group in the city-state that had reviewed the data calculated the number at 400, including family offices, but also asked not to be identified due to the sensitivities involved. Analysts expect the number of family offices — many of which are from China — to be well over 1,000 by the end of this year, compared with 400 at the end of 2020.\n\n“China has a huge domestic market, but increasingly, businesses there work around the world. They know sensitivities arise if they remain Chinese, so they market themselves as international. Singapore, with its strong regulatory system and global reputation, allows that platform,” said Ryan Lin, a director at Singapore’s Bayfront Law. “If those numbers are correct, it would be a huge step up from previous years.”\n\nSingapore is expected to benefit from the trend as it works to establish itself as a centre for global finance and capital flows. In September, it overtook Hong Kong as Asia’s biggest financial hub and became third overall behind New York and London, according to the Global Financial Centres Index.\n\nThe city-state is also proving to be a better location for networking and dealmaking than China, where border restrictions and rolling coronavirus lockdowns have limited crucial business travel for executives.\n\n“We call it Singapore-washing, and it definitely helps tick boxes when we present a company to investors if we can say it is domiciled or headquartered or even listed in Singapore,” said an executive at a global private equity firm.\n\nThe trend has accelerated. Shein, a fashion company popular with western consumers, has aggressively expanded its Singapore office this year. Since 2021, it has been operated by Singapore-registered Roadget Business, according to filings first reported by Reuters, which one lawyer specialising in US equity listing rules said “could make it easier to list in the US”.\n\nNio, the EV start-up that plans to expand into the US market after entering Europe, listed on the Singapore exchange in May this year, despite already being listed in New York and Hong Kong.\n\nThe automaker said the listing was important for its “global business development” and an adviser familiar with the deal said the move was partially a hedge to retain access to international finance.\n\nThe flotation came at the same time Nio was put on a list of 80 Chinese companies facing expulsion from US exchanges following a stand-off between Washington and Beijing over accounting practices.\n\nOthers have established parent companies in Singapore. Cue Group was formed through a merger of three Chinese companies in Shanghai in 2017. Shi Kan, Cue’s chief executive, who divides his time between Shanghai and Singapore, said the company was originally founded in Singapore, but most of its 2,000 employees, along with most of its deals, were in mainland China.\n\nShi told the Financial Times its Singapore office was the “growth engine” for global expansion. There were only 20 staff members in Singapore as of September, but that would double by the end of the year, he said.\n\nTraditionally, Hong Kong was the choice for many such companies, said Kia Meng Loh, a senior partner at Dentons Rodyk. But with Beijing “flexing its muscles” in the semi-autonomous rival finance hub, Singapore is the obvious next choice, he said.\n\nLoh said he was seeing instances where Chinese companies were forming joint ventures with Singaporean entities, pursuing a merger or buyout, hiring Singaporean management and employees or including Singaporeans on the board.\n\nOne such company is St Louis Medical Devices, a joint venture set up in Singapore in 2020. The shareholders are a US company that specialises in technology to measure blood sugar levels without a needle and its Chinese partner, which injects capital and raises funds. George Chen, managing director of the joint venture, said Singapore was the “gateway to Asia”.\n\nAnti-China sentiment in crucial markets such as India has also created obstacles for some Chinese companies, especially those designing apps for mass consumption. Lawyers and bankers cite instances where Chinese companies had redomiciled in Singapore specifically so they could launch apps in India without the “baggage”.\n\nSingapore’s government is closely watching the trend to ensure no rules are broken. New regulations from December will require Singaporean entities to record nominee shareholders and identify controlling executives.\n\n“There is a bright future for Singapore, but it has to be handled properly, and the government here has been taking the right steps to optimise the opportunity for the country,” said Greg Kallinikos, Asia chief executive of StoneX, a Nasdaq-listed international financial services company. Kallinikos said Singapore’s legal system is reassuring to the global investment community.\n\n“The minute you hear [a company] is Singapore-incorporated, jurisdictionally it gives you a lot of confidence,” he said.",

    "body": "When conversations in Singapore turn to souring geopolitics, there are some who cannot resist pointing out the upside. Of course nobody wants a new cold war, assures one former top official. But if such a situation were unavoidable, and blocs started forming more rigidly and confrontationally around a US-China split, Singapore might be better positioned than anyone to play both sides.\n\nYet as companies and investors position themselves for what could well be a difficult 2023, little over the past 10 days has resolved the question of whether the November 14 talks between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping set some sort of floor on deteriorating relations, or whether they will continue falling dangerously as many had projected. The cold war lexicon provides easy filler for the gaps created by all this uncertainty.\n\nLurking behind this ominous shorthand, though, is a more intriguing, Singapore-specific nuance. Even without the risks of a new cold war, the hazards associated with deglobalisation and decoupling merit serious attention from everyone. And Singapore, perhaps sooner than anyone else, appears to have tacitly accepted both as inevitable.\n\nThere are several areas where the signs of this acceptance are already showing. The first, according to people close to Singapore’s two sovereign funds and other large institutional investors, is an acknowledgment that investment criteria have significantly changed. The relative certainties of the globalisation era are eroding fast, confides one. Everything must now be scrutinised through a geopolitical lens and with an assumption that pure economic logic, in a world where companies are forced to second-guess or hedge against geopolitics, may no longer be paramount in corporate decision-making.\n\nBy extension, said one senior fund manager, the investment prospects of individual companies should now be judged by their navigation of distinct spheres. Companies that would once have had to prove broad global growth prospects to make their investment case, they said, can theoretically now reach the same point by demonstrating an ability to grow in either a China sphere or a western one.\n\nSecond, the deglobalisation theme, say Singapore-based investment bank heads, is also making its mark on mergers and acquisitions. Singapore’s increasingly strong position in Asian dealmaking has given its financial services sector a clearer view of how companies are thinking their way into a more decoupled world. Regional dealmaking, predicted one banker, will focus on building resilience in a decoupled world. Globalisation will fade as the central driver in favour of growth within, but not necessarily across, the new lines being drawn by US-China tensions.\n\nA third signal, described by lawyers, is the influx of Chinese capital and the desire by mainland companies to establish themselves as international, Singapore-based entities.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2021, the number of family offices based in Singapore surged from 400 to 700. Lawyers dealing with the deluge say that more than half of these are from China and predict that the number could be over 1,500 by the end of this year, amid a huge backlog of unprocessed applications.\n\nAt the same time, Chinese companies are ascribing Singapore a central role in their preparations for a more polarised business environment with less ready access to global capital. A growing number of those that have already felt the pain of decoupling, or can readily envisage it, have initiated processes to redomicile in Singapore. Some are specifically doing it, say lawyers, because their international strategies have been thwarted by geopolitics. Technology companies, their lawyers add, have been the earliest to make the move. Other sectors will surely follow.\n\nSome of the moves have clearly been accelerated by a desire to escape China’s restrictive zero-Covid policies. Others may simply be to do with the protection of family wealth from the uncertainty of existence under Xi. But both the family offices and the redomicilings, say advisers, are symptoms of a growing panic that decoupling is now real, with few options better than Singapore. The wish to make the move there from China, said one lawyer, may have been around for some time; but the need to do so has not been felt until now and it is the decoupling narrative that has caused that change.\n\nSingapore, through luck and judgment, may have made itself the right place at what, for the world at large, is the wrong time.\n\nleo.lewis@ft.com",

    "body": "Temasek has written off its $275mn stake in cryptocurrency company FTX, with the Singapore state investor saying its trust in former chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried appeared “misplaced”.\n\nTemasek invested $210mn in FTX International and $65mm in the company’s US subsidiary across two funding rounds. The total cost of the investment was 0.09 per cent of its S$403bn (US$293bn) portfolio, it said on Thursday.\n\nTemasek was one of the blue-chip investors in Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange, which collapsed into bankruptcy this month. SoftBank’s Vision Fund and Sequoia Capital have also had to mark down their FTX investments to zero.\n\nAlong with Temasek, the support of international investors including BlackRock and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan gave FTX credibility.\n\n“It is apparent from this investment that perhaps our belief in the actions, judgment and leadership of Sam Bankman-Fried, formed from our interactions with him and views expressed in our discussions with others, would appear to have been misplaced,” Temasek said.\n\nThe Singaporean investor defended its “extensive” eight-month due diligence of FTX in 2021. It is “not practicable to eliminate all risks”, it added.\n\nTemasek’s writedown comes as FTX publicly distances itself from Bankman-Fried, who has repeatedly taken to Twitter to make statements about the company he founded and the events that led to its collapse.\n\n“Mr. Bankman-Fried has no ongoing role at [FTX], FTX US, or Alameda Research Ltd. and does not speak on their behalf,” John Ray, the newly appointed chief restructuring officer and chief executive at FTX, said in a statement.\n\nBankman-Fried, who resigned as chief executive on November 11, the day FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware, said on Wednesday that the group became “overconfident and careless” as its brand grew.\n\n“FTX was the darling of Silicon Valley,” he said, adding that he was going to “care less” about a “dumb, contentless, ‘good actor’ framework”. He also said financial services regulators have an “impossible job”.\n\n“Even so, there are regulators who have deeply impressed me with their knowledge and thoughtfulness . . . but most are overwhelmed,” Bankman-Fried said.",

    "body": "In the Hollywood hit Crazy Rich Asians, the main character flies into Singapore’s Changi airport and delights in the fact that it has a butterfly garden and a movie theatre. JFK airport in New York City is “just salmonella and despair”, she remarks.\n\nChangi, which opened in 1981, topped the annual Skytrax World Airport Awards for eight consecutive years before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. And if it sets a standard for airports, then national flag carrier Singapore Airlines is the airborne embodiment of that modern and cosmopolitan image.\n\nThis is why the enduring focus on the “Singapore Girl” — a term for female cabin crew coined in a marketing campaign 50 years ago — has been increasingly called into question by critics as outdated.\n\nStories abound about the airline’s rules for female cabin crew. On chat rooms and blogs, current and former flight attendants offer advice to those preparing for interviews and training. Many discuss the need to stay below a certain body mass index level and detail how their make-up palette and even hairstyles are chosen for them, while others warn that candidates — who are advised to be “humble” and “elegant” — may be rejected for having a mole on their face.\n\nSingapore Airlines is not the only flag carrier to hire attractive women, of course. But many in the city-state were shocked last month to learn that, up until this year, Singapore Girls were fired when they became pregnant. In October, the airline announced that it had dropped a policy that required female cabin crew to leave the airline after the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nThe change means pregnant cabin crew also receive paid maternity leave for up to 16 weeks before being automatically added to the next flight roster, bringing Singapore Airlines in line with other local employers.\n\nThe company said cabin crew “may choose to work in a temporary ground attachment” during their pregnancy, although they would have to apply for such roles. “All eligible cabin crew who have applied for ground positions so far have been offered available positions suitable for their expertise,” it said.\n\n“When you put all of this together — the Singapore Girl, the fact they were one of the last global airlines to hire female pilots, the pregnancy rules — the optics are not great,” said one director at a women’s rights organisation in Singapore.\n\nSingapore Airlines did not provide a reason for the change. Advocacy groups suggest that the airline, which laid off thousands of employees during the pandemic, is desperate to retain staff to meet the rebound in global travel. Changi is one of the world’s busiest airports and a top transfer hub for Asia. Singapore Airlines this month reported a record quarterly operating profit of S$678mn ($493mn).\n\nThe Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware), a non-governmental organisation based in Singapore, said in a statement that it was “surprised” that the carrier had continued the practice of forcing pregnant staff to quit for as long as it did.\n\n“We can only speculate as to why [the airline] decided to make the change this year,” it said. “It’s possible that because of the pandemic the job market is currently very tight and it makes sense to not terminate employees’ contracts unnecessarily.”\n\nEmployees still have to apply for ground work with no guarantee of securing a position, Aware says. The precise grooming standards remain unclear but may also restrict opportunities for returning mothers, it added.\n\nMaternity discrimination is against the law in Singapore, so the question arises how the government-backed airline was able to enforce the policy until 2022 despite years of criticism. It also casts a pall over state efforts to address workplace discrimination, particularly against women.\n\nResearch carried out by Aware shows that maternity discrimination is still a widespread issue in Singapore and other employers do find ways to get around existing laws. Aware says its workplace harassment and discrimination advisory reported 71 maternity discrimination cases in 2021, out of a total of 88 discrimination cases reported to them that year.\n\nMany hope that forthcoming anti-discrimination legislation — a first for Singapore — will be more effective in rooting out such practices by closing loopholes.\n\nMany of the cases examined by Aware are related to small and medium-sized enterprises, not major brands such as Singapore Airlines — which is why how the carrier treats its female employees is so important. Singapore Airlines should be the sky-high bar other employers are held to, rather than a floor.\n\nmercedes.ruehl@ft.com / @mjruehl",

    "blurb": "City seeks to attract retail investors by shifting towards clear rules",
    "date": "2022-11-0800:00:00.0",
    "body": "Hong Kong has kicked off a contest to become Asia’s crypto capital as investors and executives warn that rival Singapore may be squandering its head start with its pivot to stricter regulation.\n\nThe sudden shift in Hong Kong last week towards clear rules for retail investors to trade digital assets follows years of ambiguity from regulators. That made some companies reluctant to build up a greater presence in the city, and capitalise on demand from mainland China, where crypto trading is outlawed.\n\n“This kind of regulation [in Hong Kong], this kind of positive development, I think we have been waiting for [it for] five years,” said Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at OKX, a crypto exchange with offices in Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n“The regulatory status of Hong Kong is very important on a global scale . . . industry participants are seeking a proper licence everywhere in the world, but what they really want is a regulatory status in a major financial centre,” Lai added.\n\nThat delay is reflected in the size of Hong Kong’s market in comparison to its great rival, Singapore. With about $74bn, Hong Kong trails Singapore in terms of the value of crypto assets received in the year to the end of June, with the latter’s total coming in at about $100bn, according to Chainalysis, a consultancy.\n\nThe clash between the two financial hubs came to a head last week, when they held overlapping fintech conferences. At their event, Hong Kong officials announced a public consultation on how retail investors could have a suitable degree of access to digital assets under a new licensing regime. Rules at present limit crypto trades to institutional investors with a portfolio of at least HK$8mn (US$1mn).\n\n“I think [Hong Kong] could still regain that [leading global crypto hub] status,” said Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder and chief executive of FTX. “It’s absolutely not too late for that.” FTX quit Hong Kong for the Bahamas last year owing to the city’s strict Covid-19 restrictions and more regulatory clarity in the Caribbean.\n\nIn contrast, the Monetary Authority of Singapore proposed to tighten regulations for retail investors, after years of trying to attract some of the biggest names. The “crypto credit crunch” earlier this year revealed a number of companies with ties to Singapore, such as hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.\n\nRavi Menon, managing director of the MAS, said in a speech at Singapore’s fintech festival last week that the city-state did not want to be a hub for trading and speculating in the asset class. The central bank has proposed barring retail investors from borrowing to invest in cryptocurrencies and requiring crypto exchanges to check that would-be buyers understand the risks.\n\nThe contrasting approaches have already prompted some to change their plans. “With the recent policy announcements, we will be prioritising and accelerating our business plans in Hong Kong over Singapore. Previously we planned to move our headquarters to Singapore, but now that plan is on pause,” said Adrian Wang, chief executive of Metalpha, a crypto asset management service provider.\n\nHong Kong’s shift comes despite the ban levied on crypto trading in mainland China. “Hong Kong seems to be positioning itself as a much more open jurisdiction for crypto trading as compared to Singapore, which is especially interesting in the context of how hard the mainland has cracked down,” said Zennon Kapron, head of fintech consulting firm Kapronasia.\n\nThe city is at pains to emphasise it has a regulatory system that is separate from mainland China. “The key elements that international investors or people come to Hong Kong for is our international connectivity . . . together with our access to China,” said Hong Kong’s financial services secretary Christopher Hui.\n\nSingapore says it is still “embracing” crypto but focusing on institutional markets.\n\n“We are embracing fully the underlying technologies of distributed ledgers and the potential that they have to transform financial markets,” said Lawrence Wong, Singapore’s deputy prime minister, as he opened its conference.\n\nAnalysts and industry executives said there would be greater clarity when the two cities published the final versions of their plans. “Hong Kong’s regime will be going into effect in March, and there’s plenty of time for Singapore to issue similar guidelines in the first quarter of next year,” said Vince Turcotte, Hong Kong-based director of digital assets at Eventus.\n\nBut Hong Kong’s ambiguity on crypto may have already cost it as the hub of choice for companies and executives.\n\n“I don’t look at the Hong Kong announcement as anything more than the whole region waking up to ‘this is real and here to stay’,” said Brooks Entwistle, a senior vice-president at cryptocurrency company Ripple. “But Singapore has been open for the last several years, making all the right moves to remain the long-term regional or global headquarters of choice for fintech and crypto organisations.”",

    "body": "Civil rights activists in Singapore were puzzled when their government issued a challenge to Sir Richard Branson. The UK billionaire entrepreneur was invited last month to take part in a televised debate in response to his blog post criticising the city-state’s strict drug policy and death penalty.\n\nHome affairs and law minister K. Shanmugam’s offer of a plane ticket and accommodation for him to come and argue his position seemed at odds with Singapore’s stance at home. The government had shown a willingness to use the country’s laws and other means to silence local criticism, discourage opposing views and stop behaviours deemed unacceptable, critics said.\n\nWriting on Twitter, Jolovan Wham asked Shanmugam why the minister could not debate the issue with his local community in Singapore instead. In response, Shanmugam blocked Wham on social media and deleted his comment, the activist told the Financial Times.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder that while Singapore continues to embrace western commerce and has shifted on some issues such as gay rights, the island remains politically authoritarian and socially dirigiste.\n\nSingapore is trying to attract global talent in everything from cryptocurrencies to the metaverse, after leaping ahead of Hong Kong in September to become the world’s biggest financial hub behind London and New York.\n\nAs the ruling People’s Action party — in power since independence in 1965 — prepares for new leadership, it has redoubled efforts to protect the cultural status quo, according to experts. But its popularity is in decline and its stance ignores the views of a more liberal, younger generation of Singaporeans.\n\nIn October alone, a global fashion magazine has been chided for promoting non-traditional families, a bill has been introduced to amend the constitution to protect the heterosexual definition of marriage, a controversial film has been banned on religious grounds and an adult content creator has been jailed. Unlike Branson, some local activists against the death penalty have been issued with police warnings.\n\n“The government has always taken an interesting position that even if it is unable to really regulate individual activities, it does feel it needs to state its position on values publicly — even as a symbolic act,” said Chua Beng Huat, a professor at Yale-NUS college. “There is a will to govern not just the economy but also social values that are important to political stability.”\n\nOne of the biggest moves came a week ago when the government filed bills in parliament to prevent court challenges to laws and policies concerning marriage.\n\nDespite softening attitudes towards homosexuality — the city decriminalised sex between men in August via the repeal of a colonial-era law — Singapore has sought to protect itself against court challenges that could legalise gay marriage. The intervention effectively makes this a political issue the PAP can control, rather than a legal one.\n\nA similar sentiment was at play last month when Vogue Singapore saw its licence cut from one year to six months. The fashion magazine was issued a warning by the information ministry over nudity and content that promoted non-traditional families, the ministry said. Vogue did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA new film, #LookAtMe by local film-maker Ken Kwek set in Singapore and which premiered in New York, was banned by authorities in October. The movie is about a young man who is offended by a pastor’s stance on homosexuality. Government agencies said the film had the potential to cause social division and denigrated a religious community.\n\n“You’re seeing a series of reactions based on insecurity,” said Michael Barr, an associate professor in international relations at Flinders University and the author of several books on Singapore politics. “I have spoken to a few academics and civil society types and the sense of the creeping level of repression is very real.” He added that decision makers feared losing control of the narrative.\n\nSingapore maintains that the majority of its citizens support the government’s stance. In a speech in August, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted longstanding reservations by religious groups on legalising homosexuality. Shanmugam points to public surveys of Singaporeans that show majority support for the death penalty as a deterrent to drug trafficking.\n\nBut experts said the liberalisation of Singapore’s cultural scene and the growth in activism were unavoidable. “People are more liberal across generations. It is becoming more visible,” said Chua.\n\nThat is especially true of online activity, another area where Singapore has clamped down. A court last month fined and jailed Titus Low, a 22-year-old OnlyFans creator, for three weeks for accessing his account in breach of a police order to stay off the video site. Low’s channel features many sexually explicit videos and photos. He was originally charged with transmitting obscene materials by electronic means last year. Low’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven so, some citizens are hopeful the repeal of Section 377A, as the law banning gay sex was known, will mean opportunities to push boundaries without breaking the law.\n\n“If peaceful activism and changing attitudes contributed to [the repeal], maybe there is hope for a softening on other issues, such as the death penalty,” a Singaporean student told the Financial Times. However, even for them, it feels far away. “For now I am still worried about posting my views on Facebook — or in a newspaper.”\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nSingapore rejects ‘dirigiste’ and ‘authoritarian’ tags / From TK Lim, High Commissioner of Singapore, London SW1, UK",

    "body": "Welcome to the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week we are asking if there are lessons to be learned from Singapore’s approach to regulating the industry.\n\nBroadly speaking, there have been two approaches when it comes to regulating crypto.\n\nSome countries have sprung into action quickly, trying to turn themselves into a “crypto hub”. Usually driven by politicians driven by fear of missing out on the alleged future of finance. Others have been more cautious, worried about a weakening of regulatory standards. Singapore fell into the first camp; the EU the second.\n\nThose jurisdictions trying to claim early mover advantage — that perhaps once looked at Singapore with envy — may want to pause.\n\nThis week the city-state effectively performed an inelegant manoeuvre and proposed a series of new regulations aimed at bolstering the jurisdiction’s grip on bad crypto behaviour.\n\nThe original plan was to leverage Singapore’s reputation as a stable, tech-friendly, educated country with an attractive tax environment. But that has recently been tarnished by a swath of high-profile controversies.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore published two consultation papers. My colleague Mercedes Ruehl and I wrote about it here. MAS said:\n\n“Several misconduct cases have been reported by international media, including where legal proceedings were commenced against entities that did not have sufficiently robust business conduct practices in place,” it said.\n\nYou can say that again. In just the past few months, Do Kwon’s disappearance, and collapses at Three Arrows Capital and Hodlnaut have undermined Singapore’s crypto approach, and now, the city-state’s regulator seems to have noticed.\n\nBack in June, the MAS’s chief fintech officer Sopnendu Mohanty said Singapore would be “brutal and unrelentingly hard” on bad crypto behaviour. To propose tougher consumer protection laws — after the consumers you are meant to protect were left exposed to some of the worst failures in the crypto industry’s history — just doesn’t strike me as behaviour that lives up to a promise like that.\n\n“This extraordinary Game of Thrones-like battle to be the crypto hub is absurd,” former chief of the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement John Reed Stark told me. “While the goal is admirable . . . crypto, blockchain and Web 3 are not the way to get you there. Ironically, they take you in reverse,” he added.\n\nA city-state once described by industry giant Binance as a “crypto paradise” is no longer leading from the front but is instead looking at what Europe has done.\n\nBuried deep in the MAS proposals, the regulator “encourages” digital payment token trading platforms to put “good industry practices” in place to detect and deter unfair trading — things such as market manipulation, misleading conduct and insider trading.\n\nThis is remarkably similar to parts of Europe’s long-debated, now imminent, Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation. Indeed, MAS acknowledged the debt, saying: “These practices are similar to regulatory proposals put forward in other jurisdictions such as in Hong Kong and the EU.”\n\nBut what it may ultimately reveal is that EU’s marquee legislation becomes the global approach. After all, the EU is a regulatory powerhouse regardless of the industry. It’s one of the world’s biggest markets. Size matters. When it makes decisions, other jurisdictions take notice.\n\nBut what was notable about MiCA was the degree of acceptance from the industry itself. Circle’s chief strategy officer and head of policy Dante Disparte said in the summer that MiCA offered a “pathway for Europe to emerge as a competitive region for the safe, sound development of an always-on financial system”.\n\nIn my view, industry buy-in can be interpreted two ways: that the crypto has successfully lobbied for rules it likes so it can continue as it likes, or that those rules aren’t going to be so prescriptive, unexpected and stultifying that people will look elsewhere to expand their businesses.\n\nThat’s the idea anyway; the question is whether MiCA will meet those goals when it comes into force, probably next year. But if nothing else, the slower approach is more likely to prevent the awkward dance performed by Singapore.\n\nWhat’s your take on Singapore’s recent crypto moves? Email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nYou probably noticed WhatsApp go down this week.\n\nFreed from the distractions of group chats, maybe you mused that an outage underlined the risks of relying on a centralised service.\n\nIf so, you’re not alone. Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Bitfinex, offered similar counsel.\n\nYes, that’s an executive of a centralised crypto exchange that, as it happens, suffered a hack of its own in 2016, which earlier this year came sharply back into focus in the wake of an alleged multi-billion dollar money laundering case.\n\nDigital asset investment products, like exchange-traded funds and notes, or closed-ended investment funds established as trusts, have been declining in popularity since the air came out of the crypto market.\n\nAccording to data shared by data analytics platform CryptoCompare, average daily aggregate product volumes have fallen under $100mn this month. Barring a late surge, that would make it the worst month since June 2020, just as the bull run was about to get going.\n\nThe figures are part of a wider story. Last year, when popular cryptocurrency prices were surging, or going “to the moon” as the lingo has it, prices were buoyed by flattering narratives about digital gold or hedging against inflation.\n\nThis year’s crash proved those narratives no longer make sense and the result is a lot less excitement about crypto tokens.",

But regulators have sounded the alarm after a series of high-profile crypto implosions this year, and are proposing restrictions on some of the most popular speculative tools.\n\n“MAS strongly discourages speculation in cryptocurrencies by consumers,” it said. “Several misconduct cases have been reported by international media, including where legal proceedings were commenced against entities that did not have sufficiently robust business conduct practices in place,” it added.\n\nThis year, Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital collapsed, taking down exchange Voyager Digital with it. An international manhunt is also under way, with a focus on the city-state, to track down Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, whose stablecoin terraUSD imploded in May.\n\nThe MAS has stopped short of an outright crypto ban, saying it welcomes the “transformative economic potential” of the asset class. But trading platforms must ensure retail customers were fully aware of risks and had the financial resources to withstand large losses, it said. “Support for a digital asset ecosystem does not mean support for cryptocurrency speculation,” it noted.\n\nThe MAS also said so-called stablecoins, which are designed to track the value of real assets such as the dollar in tokenised form, must be properly backed with reserve assets pegged to the Singapore dollar or other major currencies.\n\nNizam Ismail, founder of Singapore-based Ethikom Consultancy, told the Financial Times some proposals “may be overly prescriptive and go against the grain of Singapore’s regulatory philosophy”.\n\n“The prohibition against purchase of [tokens] by credit cards or by credit could unwittingly encourage retail investors to trade in crypto derivatives, which are largely unregulated,” Ismail added.\n\nBroader proposals include forcing service providers to ensure customer assets are segregated from their own assets and adopting “good industry practices” against unfair trading, including monitoring trading activity and setting out rules governing trading.\n\n“Digital payment token markets have been susceptible to unfair trading practices of market manipulation, misleading conduct and insider trading by nefarious actors,” the MAS said.\n\nSingapore will be likely to encounter the same issues as other jurisdictions in monitoring and controlling trading by its citizens on platforms domiciled overseas or operating outside regulatory oversight. “The problem of unregulated entities operating in this space in Singapore is not accounted for,” said Kelvin Low, a law professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nThe regulator’s proposals are open to public consultation until December 21.",

    "body": "Singapore’s mixed martial arts promoter One Championship is expecting to reach profitability in a few years, its group president told Nikkei Asia, though he noted that the company was still prioritising investments to cement its global position outside Asia.\n\nFrom eye-catching short highlights on Facebook to live broadcasts on streaming services such as Amazon’s Prime Video, the combat sports brand’s fights have become ubiquitous across many tech platforms, gaining global reach thanks to more viewers staying at home during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nEven as one of the fastest-growing digital sports companies — with as many as 14bn views globally last year across social media platforms — One Championship is still focused on investing in overseas expansions in North America, particularly the US, where US promoter the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has a stronghold.\n\n“We’re not there yet [to break even]. It could take a few years. The clear thing is that we’re on our way,” One Championship group president Teh Hua Fung said in an interview.\n\nAt a time of market uncertainty, when more investors are placing greater scrutiny on profitability, One Championship’s challenge highlights whether high-growth companies needing heavy investments can prove their growth stories from the initial lossmaking stage.\n\nTeh said he was confident the group’s business model was “inherently profitable”, adding that “revenue will grow very quickly” once the company has strong brand recognition and the content to lure viewers in overseas markets.\n\n“It’s like a theme park, or a piece of art — when it’s not done, it’s not worth much,” said Teh, “but when it’s done, it’s worth a lot.”\n\n“If you try to monetise too early, you actually limit your growth,” he added.\n\nFounded in 2011 by chair and chief executive Chatri Sityodtong, a martial arts instructor turned entrepreneur with a Thai father and a Japanese mother, One Championship began mainly as a promoter of live events. Investors include Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and America’s Sequoia Capital.\n\nSince the late 1990s, combat sports have been through a dramatic rise and fall. In Asia, Japan’s K-1 professional kick-boxing reached its height, followed by the mixed martial arts brand Pride, which at one point was one of the biggest competitors to UFC.\n\nBut One Championship saw south-east Asia’s potential, with its traditionally rich martial arts culture, including muay Thai, silat melayu in Malaysia, the Philippines’ eskrima or Myanmar’s lethwei.\n\nApart from mixed martial arts, the company has featured muay Thai, submission grappling and Burmese boxing, making it a bigger platform than UFC in terms of the number of disciplines.\n\nWhile past Asian promoters had to rely on television broadcasts, One Championship took advantage of the rapid penetration of smartphones in the region.\n\n“In the old days, it was all about TV networks and TV stations,” said Teh. “Digital players are becoming right up there in the game.”\n\nThe company has been expanding its media and digital revenue sources, such as media rights and sponsorships, which now account for more than half of its total revenue, according to Teh. In 2018, it became a unicorn, an unlisted company whose value tops $1bn, distributing content to over 150 countries.\n\n“This is an intellectual property business where you have to grow the IP to an appropriate scale before the revenue happens,” said Teh. “The challenge is building the IP and getting it to a point where you have product and brand leadership and big distribution.”\n\nThe years of the Covid-19 pandemic had brought a mix of “good and bad”, Teh added. The absence of live events hit ticket sales and hosting fees, which are some of its main revenue sources.\n\nStill, Teh said, 2021 turned out to be a “record year” for revenues, as the company was able to get wider viewership and license fees.\n\nAccording to a Nielsen report released in April, One Championship ranked second overall in digital viewership for global sports properties, just after the National Basketball Association of North America.\n\nThe combat sports company has travelled across platforms and is now venturing overseas with more partnerships to gain an audience beyond its main Asian markets.\n\nIn April, it announced a five-year distribution deal with Amazon’s Prime Video to broadcast live events to the US and Canadian markets.\n\n“The more people watch us, the more they will know the brand and we get to acquire new fans in the world’s largest sports market, and we’re aiming to have physical live events in the US next year,” said Teh.\n\nThe overseas expansion follows its latest $150mn funding in December last year, led by Guggenheim Investments and the Qatar Investment Authority. The round is reported to have given the group a valuation of $1.35bn.\n\nWhether the company can gain traction in the US, however, will be crucial to proving its growth story ahead of its much-anticipated initial public offering. Parent company Group One Holdings has reportedly chosen the US for an IPO.\n\n“A potential IPO is one of several options we are considering to raise capital in the long term. We want the company to be ready because you never know when markets will turn. But there’s no immediate [plan],” said Teh.\n\n“What we are focused on now is being good stewards of the money that we raised.”\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on September 26 2022. ©2022 Nikkei Inc.

    "body": "The international manhunt for Do Kwon, co-founder of collapsed cryptocurrency operator Terraform Labs, has put the spotlight on Singapore, whose reputation has taken a hit following the failure of several digital asset funds with links to the city-state.\n\nNot only was Kwon’s company, whose stablecoin terraUSD imploded in May, registered in Singapore, but Korean prosecutors believe he travelled to the city-state in April.\n\nKwon last week showed Singapore as his location on Twitter, writing that he was making “zero effort” to hide. Singapore police have said Kwon is not in the city-state.\n\nKwon’s case is not the only high-profile crypto controversy unfolding in Singapore, which was until recently pitching itself as a digital asset-friendly destination in competition with global rivals Dubai and Zurich.\n\nCrypto executives and experts said the lengthening list of scandals and collapses has tarnished Singapore’s reputation after officials touted its stability, sophisticated regulation and tax-friendliness as an advantage for crypto companies and investors.\n\n“The reputational damage over the last six months is a lot more serious than has been let on,” said Kelvin Low, a law professor at the National University of Singapore. “Every time one of these companies is brought up, they are mentioned [as being] based in Singapore.”\n\nSome of the biggest crypto collapses can be traced through Singapore, which had attracted digital asset companies from all over the world.\n\n“Singapore has the most liberal regulatory environment after Switzerland in terms of crypto investment,” Kim Hyoung-joong, head of the Cryptocurrency Research Center at Korea University.\n\n“Crypto players prefer to operate in Singapore because of transparent regulations and their easy access to investors for funding,” said Kim.\n\nThree Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that collapsed in June, started as a registered fund management company in Singapore.\n\nManagement of the company’s sole fund later shifted to an offshore entity in the British Virgin Islands. Co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies have not revealed their location since Three Arrows’ failure.\n\nSingapore’s regulator reprimanded Three Arrows for providing false information and breaching certain asset management thresholds. It added that it was assessing whether further regulatory breaches occurred.\n\nHodlnaut, a Singaporean crypto lender that received in-principle licensing approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, halted withdrawals and cut the majority of its employees earlier this year.\n\nIn August, Hodlnaut was placed under interim judicial management. The company said this decision would “provide a better chance of recovery”. Singapore police said that they were “looking into” Hodlnaut.\n\nSingapore police did not investigate the terraUSD collapse despite a complaint being filed, according to local media. Police did not respond to a request for comment regarding Terraform Labs and Kwon.\n\nMAS said “none of these troubled companies are licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore” under its Payment Services Act, which regulates payments systems, and so were not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIt said Three Arrows Capital had “ceased to manage funds [in Singapore] prior to the problems leading to its insolvency”. It added that Hodlnaut had withdrawn its licence application, so the “suspension of services is not in breach” of Singapore regulations.\n\n“In Singapore, as is the case in all other jurisdictions, not all activities related to cryptocurrencies are regulated,” said MAS, adding that its “evolving regulatory approach makes Singapore one of the most comprehensive in managing the risks of digital assets”.\n\nAs the crypto crunch set in, regulators in Singapore have started taking a tougher line, with officials promising to be “unrelentingly hard” on bad behaviour in the sector.\n\nBut experts said Singapore was not doing enough to punish or investigate possible fraud as a crisis has swept through the digital asset industry, causing an avalanche of losses for retail investors.\n\n“I do think there is an extent to which [Singapore] is willing to say one thing and do something quite different,” an executive at a crypto company active in Singapore said.\n\nThe same executive said they believe Singapore was in a “tight spot” in trying to balance being seen as a “serious player in the world economy” and “trying to promote themselves as a hub for innovation in a nascent industry which is clearly showing itself to have more and more bad actors”.\n\nIn August, MAS managing director Ravi Menon distanced the regulator from the scandals and said it would take “further measures to reduce consumer harm”.\n\nMost steps have been preventive measures to protect Singaporean retail investors, such as a crackdown on advertising, rather than disciplinary ones.\n\nThe changing tone from officials including Menon has caused some crypto companies to reassess their Singapore operations.\n\nBinance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has abandoned plans to make the city a hub despite its chief executive Changpeng Zhao living there for much of 2021. Last year, it was also placed on the MAS investor alert list.\n\n“Singapore is not a big focus for us,” said Gleb Kostarev, regional head of Asia for Binance. “A lot depends on regulation . . . previously Singapore was some kind of like crypto paradise . . . times changed.”\n\nOthers have come to the defence of Singapore’s status as a crypto hub, suggesting it would be unfair to blame the city-state.\n\n“I think it’s somewhat also unfair to try to put all the onus and responsibility on the regulators, when often the party to blame in many instances are the crypto markets players who frankly, in many cases, should know better,” said one individual familiar with the matter.\n\nTeresa Goody Guillén, partner at US law firm BakerHostetler, said an Interpol red notice for Kwon was “unlikely to have an impact on legitimate companies’ interest in forming or operating in Singapore”.\n\nThe crypto industry “does not appear to react negatively to law enforcement investigating allegations of criminal activity, fraud, and the like,” she added.\n\nChainUp, a blockchain company that offers technology to crypto exchanges and other clients said it was expanding in the city-state.\n\nThe start-up relocated its headquarters from China to Singapore in 2019 as Beijing was signalling it was clamping down on the sector.\n\n“I am confident in the approach of regulators,” said Sailor Zhong, ChainUp’s chief executive.\n\n“No one country can do it all and it is hard for Singapore’s government to enforce rule of law for companies with operations abroad.”",

    "body": "The convention centre at Marina Bay Sands, 55 storeys below the world’s longest rooftop infinity pool and surrounded by designer shops and celebrity chef restaurants, is a fitting place to find S$25,000 ($17,000) sculpted glass exercise bikes, displays by petrochemical companies, crystal chandeliers and a man in Balenciaga trainers aggressively painting a canvas to promote a new piano, being played by his twin brother.\n\nPerhaps less so the objects made from cow dung, cigarette butts, old newspapers and sweepings from dog groomers. But all of these were at the first FIND design fair, one of the sources of surprise at Singapore Design Week.\n\nLaunched in 2014, Singapore Design Week returned in 2022 after a two-year break. “You can really feel the city come alive again,” says Dawn Lim, executive director of the Design Singapore Council. “And we’re ready”.\n\nThe Design Week organisers say that the 2022 edition, which ran September 16-25, aimed to promote Singapore and its “distinctive brand of creativity” globally. The hiatus, due to pandemic restrictions, was a “good time to hit the refresh button”, says festival director Mark Wee.\n\nThe programme had three themes, or “pillars”: Design Futures, which builds on the idea of Singapore as a futuristic prototype for the world; Design Marketplace, which looks at design trends in south-east Asia and positions Singapore as a “global-Asia hub”; and the socially conscious Design Impact.\n\nEvents across Singapore included public installations, exhibitions and tours, as well as the Design Futures symposium at Victoria Theatre.\n\nDeveloped by creative director Paola Antonelli, curator and director of R&D at MoMA, the symposium was titled “Agency for the Future: Design and the Quest for a Better World”. Speakers included the architect Thomas Heatherwick — creator of huge public spectacles such as New York’s Vessel, the B of the Bang in Manchester and London’s unrealised Garden Bridge — who decried “boring” architecture.\n\nGerontologist Emi Kiyota, who has advised on building communities for retired monks in Bhutan, spoke about the need to create homes for seniors without segregating them. “Older people don’t want to live only with other older people,” she said.\n\n“Agropolitan” expert Stephen Cairns, of ETH Zurich’s Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore, discussed how to turn a place that imports 90 per cent of its food into one that produces 30 per cent, as Singapore aims to do by 2030. His solution is to use black soldier flies to quickly process food waste into fertiliser for more crops. One question arose from the audience, though — is it halal?\n\nSingapore might not be “giving all the answers yet”, says Antonelli. “Butit’s asking the right questions, questions that can be extrapolated in the outside world.” There is one certain conclusion drawn from Singapore Design Week. Design is “not only cute chairs”, in her words.\n\nThese are the highlights from a week showcasing the best design.\n\nFIND design fair\n\nMarina Bay Sands hosted the first edition of new annual trade show FIND — Design Fair Asia. The show had more than 11,000 visitors over three days and more than 500 interior and furniture design companies, from Singapore and abroad. Partnered with Fiera Milano, home of Salone del Mobile, and with speakers including Low Yen Ling, minister of state for trade and industry, and Italian ambassador Mario Andrea Vattani, the programme was aimed at introducing Singapore to the global design circuit.\n\nBut for something more radical, there was the Emerge @ Find showcase, featuring 55 innovative upcoming design studios from south-east Asia, curated by Suzy Annetta, editor-in-chief of magazine Design Anthology.\n\nMany of these designers subverted traditional techniques and materials to create contemporary objects, such as 14th-century Thai celadon pottery glazing on insulated double-walled tea cups and bamboo sculptures by Piboon Amornjiraporn of Plural Designs. Weaving was used to create psychedelic geometric shapes, as in the vast digital loom jacquard piece by Tiffany Loy from Singapore.\n\nThe bendiness of locally grown cane and rattan was exploited in unfamiliar new shapes.\n\nIndonesian designer Alvin Tjitrowirjo showed a flowing Log bench, and Teerapoj Teeropas of design studio Kitt-Ta-Khon, from Thailand, added nylon to create arresting black-and- white stripes in his Qing dynasty-style Chino console table.\n\nSustainable and salvaged materials were another theme. Cynthia Chan from Singapore created woven and felted “pelts” and upholstery from clipped dog hair that would otherwise end up in landfill, recovered from local pet groomers. Adhi Nugraha from Indonesia made use of (thoroughly cleaned) cow dung and cigarette butts in curvy lamps, speakers and stools.\n\nAnybody drawn to dramatic shapes and sleek luxury was well served by a litany of pieces — including Dear Spirits, a series of jagged welded altars by Tan Wei Ming of Sputnik Forest Labs, Malaysia, and the gleaming blue-green resin Fossil chair and cabinet by Charif Lona of Thailand’s Studio AOK.\n\nNew Optimistic Works by Studio Juju\n\nAt the National Design Centre, which houses studios, gallery space and the offices of the Design Singapore Council, was an exhibition by designers-in-residence Studio Juju. New Optimistic Works aims to “work with the possibilities and constraints of manufacturing within Singapore” and develop a design identity for the country. Some goods are produced in part here, says Studio Juju’s Timo Wong, but shipped elsewhere to be turned into finished products.\n\nPieces included a galvanised metal lamp, a collaboration with Chop Wah Hin Sheet Metal Works, which traditionally manufactures kettles, dustbins and industrial parts; a colourful metal side table that was finished in a car- spraying workshop; and recycled glassware fused in local kilns.\n\nN*thing is Possible by Potato Head, OMA & Friends\n\nAlso at the National Design Centre was an exhibition by hospitality group Potato Head in collaboration with architects OMA. Illustrating the company’s dedication to reducing waste — it sends 5 per cent to landfill now compared with 50 per cent in 2018 — the installation featured slick furniture and other amenities for its Bali locations, created from hotel waste, displayed perched on top of their raw materials.\n\nThe average tourist in Bali produces 1.7kg of waste per day, which is a lot of free material. “It’s not trash,” says Simon Pestridge, chief experience officer of Potato Head. “it’s a raw product that can be turned into something beautiful.”\n\nMax Lamb has designed colourful chairs from recycled plastic bottles. Each chair contains 830 of them, and offcuts of the resulting material are used to weld the panels together, ensuring no extra resources are required. Used cooking oil from the restaurants is cleaned and turned into scented candles in offcut wine bottles — for the Singapore exhibition the NDC on-site restaurant provided the oil. Damaged towels are turned into rugs and textiles by designers Toogood, Lamb and natural dye company Tarum, while a composite of styrofoam, oyster shells and plastics is used in toothbrush holders and bins for the hotel rooms.\n\nThe interiors of the Potato Head Studios hotel also feature recycled elements. Woven fabric by BYO Living covers the ceilings, made from 9,500 green plastic bottles per 2 square metre panel. “Turning plastic into a material that will stand the test of time in a building is the best way to use it,” says Pestridge.\n\nPotato Head is also salvaging discarded timber to create a series of furniture with Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. OMA and Max Lamb are utilising Ijuk fibre — discarded palm tree bark — to create beach umbrellas and lamps.\n\nGood Design Research pop up\n\nLocated outside the Bugis+ shopping centre, this public display featured 17 projects that have received grants from Design Singapore’s Good Design Research initiative, which supports designers working on social cohesion, sustainable processes or new materials.\n\nThe pop-up was described as showing “design research revealing its presence and relevance in our everyday lives”. Projects included a renewable replacement for reinforced concrete by design studio Produce; a proposal for using trees felled in public spaces by Roger & Sons; underwear enabling people with physical disabilities to dress independently by Will and Well LLP; and an alternative to disposable packing used at hawker food centres by Forest & Whale.\n\nLucy Watson travelled as a guest of Design Singapore Council\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow @FTProperty on Twitter or @ft_houseandhome on Instagram",

    "body": "Hong Kong’s top-ranked business schools risk losing out to regional rivals as companies exit the Chinese territory amid Beijing’s zero-Covid policies and clampdowns on civil freedoms in the city.\n\nEnrolment by international students at Hong Kong’s top universities has dropped for the first time in a decade, according to the city’s University Grants Committee. Students appear to have been deterred by China’s imposition of a sweeping national security law following pro-democracy protests in 2019, as well as pandemic curbs.\n\nBut academics at the city’s business schools worry that China’s strict zero-Covid policy will have a more lasting effect on enrolment, and push students to take courses elsewhere, such as Singapore.\n\n“More than half of our students in our full-time MBAs used to be from overseas, pre-pandemic,” says Waiman Cheung, associate dean of graduate studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Business School. “That has suffered during Covid.”\n\nChicago Booth has moved its executive MBA courses from Hong Kong to Singapore temporarily while international students are unable to travel to Hong Kong. Its Hong Kong campus remains open for locally based students. And a joint executive MBA between the University of Hong Kong, Columbia Business School, and London Business School has been suspended due to insufficient demand.\n\nOfficial data show that overseas student enrolment in all degrees across Hong Kong’s universities fell after 2019/20, although stronger demand from mainland Chinese students made up for part of that loss.\n\nAt University of Hong Kong, the city’s oldest university, enrolment by international postgraduate students has fallen from 1,382 in 2018 to 1,249 this year. But mainland Chinese students enrolled in postgraduate courses at HKU surged from 4,994 in 2018 to 7,927 this year.\n\nStudent numbers for executive MBA programmes at CUHK have yet to rebound, though. Cheung reports that enrolment is down by about a quarter.\n\nHong Kong’s weeks-long mandatory hotel quarantine for arrivals was eased to three days in August, and will finally be scrapped on Monday. By contrast, Singapore began relaxing border entry rules last year and lifted travel restrictions for arrivals in April. That has helped the city-state to recover more quickly than Hong Kong.\n\n“In terms of the business environment, Hong Kong is indeed lagging behind Singapore,” Cheung says. “Senior executives from multinational firms are unwilling to come to Hong Kong because of the quarantine requirements. It is quite obvious that fewer companies are willing to do business in Hong Kong.”\n\nHowever, the US-China trade war, which began in 2018, has prompted more mainland-Chinese students to remain in Asia for postgraduate study, as opposed to attending top institutions in the west, Cheung adds.\n\nThe appeal of top business schools in Singapore for both mainland Chinese and international students is only likely to grow if zero-Covid policies remain in place for a prolonged period, says Andrew Rose, dean at National University of Singapore Business School.\n\nPandemic restrictions combined with radical changes to Hong Kong’s political landscape is “fundamentally eroding” the territory’s competitive position, he says.\n\nBut Albert Wong, an adjunct professor at CUHK Business School’s Department of Management and chief executive of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks, says: “Hong Kong’s universities still have a strong reputation”. In his view, they “need to work harder” to encourage students to stay in the city after graduating.\n\nSingapore has not escaped the effects of pandemic clampdowns, though. Katy Montgomery, associate dean of degree programmes at the global graduate business school INSEAD, which has campuses in Paris, Singapore, Abu Dhabi and San Francisco, says fewer MBA students have opted to be based at its Asia campus because of Covid curbs and quarantine rules.\n\nStudents want to be in “countries where it is easier to go back and forth”, she explains. “Being able to travel freely, particularly during the job search, is super important.”\n\nGiven this factor, Shantanu Bhattacharya, deputy dean of education at Singapore Management University’s Lee Kong Chian School of Business, believes scrapping zero-Covid policies would benefit business schools across Asia.\n\n“China is a very important part of the business ecosystem in Asia, so our hope is that the lockdowns in China and Hong Kong get lifted soon,” he says.\n\nInternational courses have been affected, too. For the executive MBA developed jointly by the National University of Singapore Business School and the UCLA Anderson School of Management, students used to travel to China, India and the US during a 15-month programme.\n\nBut, as Covid rules mean “China is just impossible to get in and out of”, says Rose, a segment had been moved to South Korea. It was then shifted again to Spain after an uptick of infections in the East Asian country.Though business schools have adapted to “hybrid” teaching under Covid social distancing rules, he says tutors have sought to “maximise” face-to-face interactions — though he concedes this has been “difficult and expensive”.\n\nSome full-time students from mainland China have asked to complete their MBA programmes remotely back home. But, says Rose, “we typically say no to them. It dilutes the value of the degree.”\n\nThis article has been amended since original publication to make clear that Chicago Booth’s Hong Kong campus remains open for locally based students",

    "body": "Normally quiet Singapore hopes to become one big party island soon with the arrival of global pop groups including Green Day. After a two-year break due to pandemic restrictions, Formula 1 returns along with several global investment conferences. Hotel operators should have a good time too.\n\nAccommodation prices in Singapore have hit their highest in a decade. Average hotel occupancy rates approach 80 per cent, just shy of pre-pandemic levels. After Covid-19 struck, Asia’s average hotel occupancy fell to as low as 25 per cent in 2020. Shares of Asian hotel and resort operators, including Genting Singapore and Shangri-La Asia, have gained in the past year as Singapore eased border restrictions.\n\nThis is good news for the real estate investment trusts (Reits) sector. After a poor five years, Singapore-listed hospitality Reits including Far East Hospitality Trust and CDL Hospitality Trusts, have rebounded in 2022. Another, Frasers Hospitality Trust, received bid interest from a Thai property group.\n\nThat should not surprise. Singapore’s famous F1 night race could draw its biggest turnout since it began in 2008. Local carriers Singapore Airlines and Scoot reported passenger load factors of more than 85 per cent last month, nearing pre-pandemic levels. This year’s combined hotel room revenue of $1.4bn is more than double that of last year, with many hotels pricing rooms at more than $2,000 a night.\n\nOffice properties, another large portion of local Reits, also benefit from this popularity. While Hong Kong suffers a glut of office space and an expat exodus, Singapore’s office vacancy rate is below 7 per cent as of end-June. The city-state will add as many as 20,000 finance jobs over the next five years. Rental yields, along with Reit portfolio values, should pick up.\n\nRising interest rates are a risk to Reits in the short term. But long-term total returns of Reits have remained positive during times of elevated rates over the past three decades. Singapore’s celebrations should more than lift the spirits of Reits’ local shareholders.",

    "blurb": "Lender says market better-suited to established institutions that can offer greater consumer protection",
    "date": "2022-09-0500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s biggest bank plans to grow its cryptocurrency and digital assets business despite the crypto bear market, saying it wants to expand its digital exchange and offer services to more of its 300,000 wealthy clients in Asia.\n\nPiyush Gupta, chief executive of DBS since 2009, said the crypto market downturn proved that established and regulated financial institutions, rather than just start-ups, should be offering products such as digital asset trading for retail investors.\n\nThe bank’s brokerage arm last year received a cryptocurrency licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, allowing its institutional and wealthy clients access to its DBS Digital Exchange by invitation.\n\nGupta said the bank has less than 1,000 members on the exchange but would soon offer the service to 300,000 of its wealthy clients across Asia including private banks, accredited investors, other exchanges and funds through its DBS mobile banking app.\n\nThe app would make the process less clunky and quicker for clients in addition to allowing DBS to offer it to more customers, he said. DBS had total assets of S$686bn (US$488bn) as of December 2021.\n\nThe former Citibank executive, who has served in senior banking roles across Asia, said DBS had to support Singapore’s push into cutting-edge financial technology. “People look to us to be a pioneer in the space and to continue to push boundaries,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nThe plans from DBS, in which state investment group Temasek holds a stake of just under 30 per cent, come as Singapore grapples with its messaging over its attempt to be a crypto hub. The city-state, whose economy is reliant on financial services and trading, believes it must innovate to remain relevant.\n\nBut this year’s collapse of several high-profile crypto groups, including Singapore-based Three Arrows and Terraform Labs, in addition to plummeting valuations globally has prompted questions over MAS’s strategy.\n\nIn response, MAS managing director Ravi Menon said last week that the regulator would take steps to protect retail investors while affirming the city’s digital asset strategy.\n\nGupta described the challenges facing the country’s regulators. “On the one hand, we want to be a global crypto hub. On the other hand, we’re also very worried about our domestic population getting burned with this speculative asset class,” he said.\n\nGupta said losses suffered by retail investors in the crypto crash underscored the importance of more established financial institutions offering digital assets services. The total number of trades on DBS Digital Exchange has more than doubled from April to the end of June, while the quantity of bitcoin bought on the exchange has risen nearly four times. Similarly, the quantity of ether, another popular token, has increased 65 per cent over the same period.\n\n“We have been judicious about who we have brought on. My view is we can do this for retail investors but regulators don’t necessarily see it that way,” he said.\n\nAbout $1bn had flowed out of DBS and into global crypto exchanges run by companies including Genesis and Binance before the bank launched its own exchange, Gupta said. Entrusting companies such as DBS, which could put in place “guardrails” and protections, would lead to “better outcomes”, he added.\n\n“You might as well try and create frameworks and processes to make these sensibly available to everybody instead of having a regulated space and a cowboy space and let everybody go to the cowboy space.”\n\nAnalysts cautioned that no regulator can protect against market risk. “In truth, crypto is highly volatile and fundamentally it has to go down to people understanding the risk,” said Nizam Ismail, founder of Singapore-based Ethikom Consultancy, which advises companies on compliance, adding that plenty of banks had failed to do so.\n\nHypothetically, DBS could be safer for retail investors wanting to trade cryptocurrencies but it was hard to judge, he added.\n\n“What we really need is some sort of check or driver’s licence to ensure [retail investors] understand the risks. That doesn’t exist,” said Zennon Kapron, director of Kapronasia, a financial technology research and consulting group. “Whether that comes from banks like DBS is another question.”",

    "blurb": "Beijing’s talk of ‘going after the entrepreneurs’, its draconian Covid lockdowns and a growing hostility to China from the west all make the city-state an attractive place to reside",
    "date": "2022-08-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "In its 57 years as an independent country, Singapore has rarely made cultural headlines. But, in 2018, for the first time, millions around the world flocked to see a film set in the city-state.\n\nCrazy Rich Asians, a Hollywood production based on a novel by a Singaporean, enchanted foreigners with a fantasy vision of the 733 sq km island, in which ethnic Chinese billionaires flitted between mansions and five-star hotels. Singapore was portrayed as a cocktail party that never ended, where the rich would perpetually rub shoulders with each other, and luxury was always within reach.\n\nNow this already crazily rich city is receiving a big new dose of money — thanks to a fresh influx of tycoons from across the South China Sea. After enduring years of political crackdowns, severe Covid lockdowns, and unease about Beijing’s global reputation, many of China’s wealthiest have been packing their suits and designer dresses. And, according to wealth management professionals in Singapore, an increasing number are booking plane tickets to the city-state.\n\nAnecdotal reports indicate that well-heeled clients have been arriving in droves at Singapore’s hotels and seaside estates — which suggests the city-state could overtake Hong Kong as the premier destination for Asia’s rich, after Beijing’s clampdown on the former British colony tarnished its allure.\n\n“It has been really crazy this year,” says Vikna Rajah, co-head of the private client business at law firm Rajah & Tann. He says his team in Singapore is handling one enquiry every week from multimillionaires keen to establish a family office — a type of private investment firm. About a third of those approaches come from China. A few years ago, the firm would receive only “a handful” of enquiries every year.\n\n“In times of uncertainty, there is always a flood to more stable jurisdictions,” Rajah says. “Singapore is seen as extremely safe, [with a] strong rule of law.”\n\nAnother financial services professional in Singapore, speaking on condition of anonymity, was more cynical: the sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs over the Ukraine war have made wealthy Chinese fear similar restrictions if Beijing pursues an invasion of Taiwan. Moving to Singapore could create some useful distance from the Chinese government, the person argues.\n\nChinese billionaires want “to stop being identified as a Chinese person,” the professional explains. “It is like money laundering. Except you are laundering your own identity”.\n\nJoseph Poon, head of private banking at Singapore lender DBS, also says demand “is getting stronger and stronger” from Chinese clients looking to establish family offices.\n\n“In the past, Hong Kong has been their traditional out-of-China stepping stone. [But now], is it really separate from China in terms of laws and regulations? A lot of clients don’t see it to be the case”. He says: “The real offshore in Asia has defaulted to Singapore.”\n\nIt is not the first time that Singapore has welcomed an influx of émigrés from China. Once a sparsely populated rainforest with barely a hundred residents, the territory became a colonial shipping port that ballooned in population in the 19th century, largely thanks to Chinese merchants and workers arriving on its shores.\n\nThe city-state has maintained close links with China since then. In 2019, more than three quarters of Singapore’s 5.3mn residents were ethnically Chinese, as has been every prime minister since independence. Singapore trades more with China than any other country.\n\nAfter Singapore emerged as a low-tax business centre in the late 20th century — with colonial buildings razed to make way for sleek glass towers — many Chinese have shielded money there in offshore funds. But, with the economy also booming at home, relatively few were interested in emigrating.\n\nNow, says one former Singapore official, “more and more Chinese friends and acquaintances are settling in and asking: how do I get permanent residence in Singapore?”\n\nBeijing’s increasing talk of “common prosperity” and “going after the entrepreneurs” has unnerved those who made their fortunes in China, they add. Today, Singapore appears far more friendly to the rich.\n\n“You want to see the real rich [Chinese]? You go and walk around Sentosa,” the official says, referring to the island off Singapore’s south coast that serves as a billionaire enclave. “There seems to be an uptick in Bentleys.”\n\nOne finance industry executive observed that “[Chinese billionaires] have always treated Singapore like a hotel, just like the Russians in London” — but also asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. “Now, they are looking to become permanent residents.”\n\nNew arrivals at Sentosa’s luxury beachside villas have come despite promises by the Singapore government to regulate foreign money more tightly. The home of Crazy Rich Asians is also home to acute inequality. Rumblings among voters about the benefits of enticing elite foreigners have pressured the government in one of the world’s most liberal economies to respond.\n\nIn April, Singapore marginally raised the bar for family offices to qualify for tax exemptions on the income from their investments. In a move seemingly designed to stop foreigners treating Singapore “like a hotel”, officials announced that they must now invest at least S$10mn ($7.1mn) locally in Singapore, or 10 per cent of their assets if this is lower. Certain funds would also be required to employ a professional from outside the family.\n\nThe changes were introduced to “enhance the positive spillovers to the Singapore economy”, an MAS spokesperson said. But wealth managers say this has not deterred Chinese clients from flying in. Committing to spending S$10mn and hiring one non-relative are negligible costs to the dynasties behind family offices, whose assets typically run into hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nIn the broader geopolitical context, Singapore is only becoming more attractive.\n\nParents “don’t want to send their kids to the west”, says one multi-millionaire and long-term Singapore resident, pointing to growing hostility towards China and racism against Chinese people in the west. “You cannot go to Hong Kong. Singapore is the most Chinese place you can go to.”\n\nAccording to the ex-Singapore official, “If you go and live in a western country, you are really burning bridges with China. We are friendly enough with China. We are geographically close, we are culturally close. You can call it a ‘China plus one’ strategy. And we are the plus one.”\n\nAnd, while appearing to tighten regulation, Singapore is in fact taking a number of steps to snatch more wealth from abroad.\n\nIts Economic Development Board, the government entity responsible for courting foreign business, has upped its marketing of the city-state as the “ideal destination” for family offices.\n\nIn 2021, as Beijing was tightening its grip on Hong Kong’s lawyers and politics, the EDB published a report extolling “Singapore’s political stability and strong rule of law”. It also highlighted how “family businesses can look forward to quality healthcare, housing and education”. By the end of 2020, there were some 400 family offices in Singapore, it noted — double the number a year earlier.\n\nSome clients were even granted “special permission” to fly into Singapore during the height of the pandemic, when residents faced one of the world’s strictest lockdowns, says Poon of DBS.\n\nAsked how his Chinese clients have spent their time since touching down in the city-state, he insists their primary interest is doing business.\n\n“I don’t think many come and think of this as Crazy Rich Asians, do crazy things in Singapore. The only indulgence I see is a lot of them playing a lot more golf,” Poon says.\n\n“Singapore remains an island of neutrality in many people’s eyes . . . Many, many Chinese are interested in expanding into [other markets], from the safety and the lighthouse that is Singapore.”\n\nThis article is part of FT Wealth, a section providing in-depth coverage of philanthropy, entrepreneurs, family offices, as well as alternative and impact investment",

    "date": "2022-08-2900:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s financial regulator has distanced itself from “heavily speculated” cryptocurrencies after a series of scandals this year that damaged the city-state’s aspirations to be seen as a safe hub for the volatile asset class.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore’s managing director Ravi Menon on Monday said the agency would take stronger measures to restrict retail access to cryptocurrencies and consider “further measures to reduce consumer harm”.\n\nHowever, he added that MAS still believed in the “transformative” economic potential of the broader digital asset ecosystem, including tokenised digital versions of existing assets.\n\nHis comments come after Singapore faced accusations it had been sending mixed signals to the crypto market. The city-state has few natural resources and is more reliant on financial services. It wants a stake in the latest financial technology advances and last year began handing out licences to players in the crypto sector and allowing both retail and institutional trading of the asset class.\n\nInvestment in Singapore’s crypto and blockchain companies surged to a record $1.48bn in 2021, according to a report by KPMG, 10 times the previous year’s total and nearly half the Asia-Pacific total for 2021.\n\nHowever, the city’s reputation as a safe hub has been dented as plummeting prices have exposed some of the industry’s biggest names who had based themselves in Singapore.\n\nSouth Korean prosecutors are investigating the $40bn implosion of the terraUSD stablecoin, created by Singapore-based founder Do Kwon. The collapsed Three Arrows, one of the best-known crypto investors, was also based in Singapore although registered in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nHodlnaut, a Singaporean crypto lender that received in principle licensing approval from MAS to offer token swaps in March, cut most of its workforce, stopped withdrawals and admitted to an investigation by the Singapore police this month. Hodlnaut had supported the luna cryptocurrency ecosystem on its platform.\n\nCryptocurrencies are not a “viable form of money or investment asset” due to their extreme price volatility, Menon said while announcing that the regulator would further restrict retail investor access to digital currencies.\n\nSome of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges, including Binance, Gemini, Coinbase and Crypto.com, applied for licences to operate, attracted by the low taxes and perceived friendly regulatory environment. Some, including Binance, have since withdrawn their applications.\n\nThe regulator had already stepped up warnings and restricted crypto players from promoting services in public. Bitcoin ATMs have been dismantled and public transport advertisements removed.\n\nDespite these warnings and measures, surveys showed that consumers were increasingly trading in cryptocurrencies, Menon said, and “MAS is therefore considering further measures to reduce consumer harm”.\n\nThese include creating suitability tests for customers and restricting the use of credit for trading. But outright bans would not work, he said, given Singaporeans could use their mobile phones to access exchanges anywhere in the world.\n\n“[Are] investor restrictions appropriate when there are so many overseas platforms for trading crypto?” said Hoi Tak Leung, counsel at Ashurst, the law firm.\n\nThe question is whether MAS’s new restrictions to protect consumers could be extended from more public-facing methods such as advertising to include exchanges, licensees or others, he added.",

    "blurb": "Commodities group’s near-collapse precipitated by highly critical reports on its accounting practices ",
    "date": "2022-08-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore has fined commodities business Noble Group S$12.6mn (US$9.1mn) for publishing “misleading information” in its financial statements, following an investigation that has taken almost four years to complete.\n\nThe announcement by the city-state’s accounting authority concludes its probe of a high-profile accounting scandal that brought Noble to the brink of collapse. It also flagged “stern warnings” given to two unnamed former directors of the group.\n\nNoble’s near-collapse, from a business worth more than $6bn that had hoped to emulate industry giant Glencore, was precipitated by a series of highly critical reports on its accounting practices published in 2015 by short seller Iceberg Research.\n\nBy 2018, it had been forced into a painful debt-for-equity swap and a delisting, and it sold a number of key assets to help it survive. The saga also dented Singapore’s reputation as a commodities trading hub.\n\nThe fine, equivalent to 0.4 per cent of Noble’s reported revenues in 2020, was criticised by Iceberg. “A minor fine for a major [scandal],” it wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe improper accounting at Noble is one of a series of scandals in recent years that have raised questions about regulations in Singapore, which has sought to attract multinationals while promoting its strong “rule of law”.\n\nA number of Singapore-based commodities groups have been at the centre of scandals in recent years, including Noble Group, Agritrade International, Hin Leong Trading, ZenRock Commodities Trading and Petro-Diamond Singapore.\n\nSome have received hefty fines and executives have faced jail time. The billionaire founder of Hin Leong, Lim Oon Kuin, in 2020 confessed to hiding $800mn in losses at the Singapore-based oil trading firm he founded. Singapore police filed more than 100 charges against Lim last year while a former director and operations executive of ZenRock were charged last month with more than $105mn worth of dishonesty offences.\n\nThe problems make the case for a stronger regulatory framework and oversight of trading houses in Singapore’s small, open economy, say analysts. But Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, an analyst at Tellimer, said they did not seem to have dented corporate enthusiasm for Singapore.\n\n“Singapore provides these companies with tax haven status and access to financiers, which these businesses are so dependent on,” he said.\n\n“Singapore’s stock exchange [lost] credibility a long time ago,” wrote Iceberg. “The lack of enforcement means even Singapore companies prefer to list elsewhere.”\n\nLoo Siew Yee, assistant managing director of the policy, payments and financial crime group at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said measures taken by the authorities against Noble “demonstrates that MAS takes breaches of disclosure obligations seriously and will take firm action against persons found to have fallen short”.\n\nNoble said it was pleased the investigation had been concluded, adding that its commodity trading business had been under new ownership and management since December 2018 and “has focused on the highest standards of corporate governance, reporting and transparency since then”.",

    "date": "2022-08-2200:00:00.0",
    "body": "LGBT+ activists have dismissed Singapore’s decision to repeal a law banning sex between men as “window dressing” that fails to substantially soften the country’s restrictions on gay rights.\n\nThe Asian city-state said on Sunday that it would scrap the colonial-era law criminalising gay sex, but also announced plans to amend the constitution to “protect” the definition of marriage as a heterosexual union from legal challenge.\n\n“This continues to entrench the discrimination against same-sex couples and LGBTQ individuals,” said Roy Ngerng, a Singaporean blogger and activist now based in Taiwan, who described the repeal as “window dressing”.\n\nWhile many LGBT+ rights activists in Singapore cheered the move to scrap section 377A, effectively legalising homosexuality, the planned constitutional amendment underlined remaining hostile attitudes towards gay rights in the global finance hub.\n\nThe ruling People’s Action party maintains that Singapore is a conservative society and social benefits are heavily linked to marital status. Young people who want to apply for government-subsidised housing, for instance, need to be married or wait until they are 35 years old.\n\nJolovan Wham, a social worker and activist, said the plans put the LGBT+ community in a worse-off position. “This is one step forwards and two steps back. I am not sure what the repeal actually does,” he said. Authorities have said the law banning sex between men is not enforced.\n\n“When you enshrine discrimination in the constitution the ramifications are pretty profound. You are saying it is OK to treat us as second-class citizens,” Wham said, adding it would make it difficult to mount legal challenges on issues such as housing, employment and adoption rights.\n\nA statement by 22 groups including Pink Dot SG, Ready 4 Repeal and Sayoni said any constitutional amendment that signalled that LGBTQ+ people were unequal citizens would be “disappointing”.\n\n“Such a decision will undermine the secular character of our constitution, codify further discrimination into supreme law, and tie the hands of future parliaments,” the groups said.\n\nExperts said the government’s attempt to compromise was inevitable. “There is no way the government could have secured or have the buy-in of the population for the repeal without indicating there will be other amendments as well,” said Eugene Tan, an associate professor at Singapore Management University.\n\n“The government is taking the view this is a matter that should be handled by a democratic political process — rather than the courts,” Tan said.\n\n“I don’t think any side has got what they wanted. I think a lot of conservatives are deeply unhappy with the PM’s decision to repeal,” said lawyer Harpreet Singh Nehal, who was lead counsel for an unsuccessful constitutional challenge against section 377A in 2019.\n\nSingapore’s hardening of its position on gay marriage comes as the city seeks to burnish its image as an open, friendly place to do business.\n\nDirectly after announcing the repeal of section 377A in a speech addressing the nation on Sunday, prime minister Lee Hsien Loong described the need to attract skilled foreign professionals.\n\nThe business community was silent on the repeal announcement. The American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore and the British Chambers of Commerce declined to comment.\n\nAdrianna Tan, a Singaporean professional working for a digital services company in San Francisco, said there was a disconnect between the government’s stance on gay rights and its desire to attract talent.\n\n“I am an educated and skilled Singaporean who tried for a long time to stay and left entirely because of sexuality,” she said.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nSingapore hopes its gay sex ruling avoids rancour / From TK Lim, High Commissioner of Singapore, London SW1, UK",

    "body": "Singapore office rents are set to hit pre-pandemic levels for the first time since the start of the Covid-19 crisis, as Chinese companies lead a rush to expand operations in the city-state.\n\nThe return of workers to the office this year, coupled with lockdowns in China and restrictions in Hong Kong that have forced foreign companies to consider alternative locations, pushed rents for prime office space in the city centre to S$10.74 (US$7.71) per square foot in the second quarter, according to real estate group JLL.\n\nRents rose 2.7 per cent compared with the previous quarter, meaning landlords in the Asian financial hub have enjoyed five consecutive quarters of growth, according to the data.\n\n“Our forecast is that it will hit S$11 by the end of the year and rise another 25 per cent by 2026,” said Regina Lim, head of strategic advisory for JLL’s Asian capital markets business.\n\nRising rents have benefited Singapore’s developers and office tower owners. Shares in GuocoLand, the developer of Guoco Midtown, a new development in the city centre due to be finished this year, have risen 7 per cent year to date. Guoco Midtown has secured leases for 30 per cent of the property, agents said. The share prices of other listed real estate investment trusts with a focus on the office sector, including CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust and Suntec Reit, have risen this year off the back of higher incomes and signing rents for their Singapore offices.\n\nThe second-quarter numbers were just 0.6 per cent short of the S$10.81 per sq ft recorded at the end of 2019, with the Singapore market outperforming rival Asian financial centres including Hong Kong and Tokyo.\n\nChinese fast fashion group Shein signed a lease in the first quarter of this year, and the company’s founder and a number of staff moved to Singapore and took prime office space in Marina Bay Financial Centre.\n\nChinese internet group Alibaba bought a stake in a central office tower in 2020 to house its international headquarters. Plans to redevelop the building into what could become the city’s tallest skyscraper were approved last month.\n\nRival Chinese technology companies ByteDance and Tencent have also explored further expansion in Singapore, according to two people with knowledge of the companies’ plans.\n\nSingapore has long been a desirable location for foreign companies to establish Asian headquarters because of its low tax rates, strong rule of law and geopolitical neutrality.\n\nThe city-state has become even more attractive during the pandemic, as lockdowns in mainland cities and severe restrictions in Hong Kong prompted companies to open offices, said Calvin Yeo, head of office advisory for Knight Frank Singapore.\n\nSanctions and geopolitical tensions between the US and China have made Singapore’s neutral position more prized.\n\n“If it continues like this we will see even more,” Yeo added.\n\nUS technology group Amazon has expanded in the city-state this year, as have US asset manager BlackRock and a number of its European counterparts.\n\nThe interest has filtered through to real estate investments. Commercial real estate deals hit a record in the June quarter, jumping 74 per cent to $5.6bn, according to data from MSCI.\n\nSingapore is seen as a more resilient haven compared with other gateway cities in the region, according to Benjamin Chow, who leads MSCI’s research on Asian commercial real estate.\n\nBut experts warned that the worsening global growth outlook and inflation could put a ceiling on Singapore’s rental growth. Technology companies, which have dominated leasing deals in the city-state, have suffered steep devaluations this year and announced job cuts.\n\n“For the first half of this year there was definitely a strong sense that corporates wanted to grow here, but with the recent correction I would be a little more cautious about aggressive expansion,” Lim said.",

This includes at least 15 funds that relocated to Singapore from tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, Mauritius and the Bahamas, according to a separate report produced by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and seen by the Financial Times.\n\nThe figures highlight how fund managers who traditionally looked to jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands are seeking an alternative home for their assets, said industry executives.\n\n“What Singapore has done is compile the same advantages of [offshore] funds,” said one fund management executive.\n\n“With increasing scrutiny of tax affairs . . . the burden of proof is on businesses to show why [your assets are abroad],” the person said. “The future lies with onshore jurisdictions.”\n\nAlthough Singapore itself has long been a popular destination for investors seeking low-tax jurisdictions, with a below-average corporate levy of 17 per cent, tax havens are being threatened with growing international scrutiny.\n\nIn recent years, the allure of offshore funds has been tarnished by a string of controversies, thrusting many into the global spotlight.\n\nLeaks including the Panama and Pandora Papers have exposed how the rich use tax havens to hide their wealth, mobilising regulators to push for a global minimum tax. Recent international efforts to target the assets of Russian oligarchs have only intensified scrutiny.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Singapore launched its VCC structure in January 2020. As long as they have operations in Singapore, funds can receive income tax exemptions and the MAS will cover up to S$150,000 (US$109,000) of setting-up costs.\n\nUnlike other companies incorporated in Singapore, financial statements and records of investors in VCCs are not available publicly.\n\nThe scheme is a “game changer” that will “facilitate re-domiciliation”, said Singapore’s deputy finance minister in 2018, when the bill enabling VCCs was passed.\n\nAnuj Kagalwala, head of asset and wealth management tax at PwC’s Singapore business, said investors were drawn to the city-state’s combination of low taxes and respectability.\n\nKagalwala said the privacy offered by VCCs was not the core attraction for investors. But “it’s definitely something that clients like”.\n\nFor funds to prove they are based in Singapore and eligible to set up a VCC, they require a local fund management licence as well as one director who lives in the city-state.\n\nOne fund management professional said Singapore was striking a balance by offering the allure of a reputable financial centre but retaining some incentives of offshore tax havens.\n\nFor wealthy foreigners, it remains “an attractive location to squirrel their money away”, the person said. “It is an established jurisdiction. But Singapore is still regarded as offshore because it has lower taxes. It is still trying to thread the needle.”\n\nMAS said the VCC scheme is intended to “increase Singapore’s attractiveness as a leading full-service fund management hub”, offering “greater operational flexibility and cost savings”.",

    "blurb": "City-state should look elsewhere for poultry after Malaysia’s export ban on key ingredient",
    "date": "2022-08-1000:00:00.0",
    "body": "A “chicken rice crisis” has sparked gastronomic panic for many Singaporeans this year. The de facto national dish of the city-state consists of poached, preferably fresh, chicken on a bed of rice. This has been scarce since Malaysia halted chicken exports in June. The ban is expected to lift later this month, according to Reuters, but a quick improvement to supply is unlikely.\n\nChicken is the most widely consumed meat in Singapore. The limited land area of the island means it imports nearly all its supplies, a third from its neighbour Malaysia. For decades, that proximity has meant that every month 3.6mn live chickens have crossed the border, albeit not voluntarily.\n\nMalaysia is also one of the world’s largest consumers of chicken. It has been hit by a severe shortage resulting from world supply problems, rising input costs and clumsy state intervention in markets.\n\nHopes that chook consignments to Singapore will resume have bolstered shares of chicken suppliers. Lay Hong is up 15 per cent year to date, QL by 8 per cent and CCK Consolidated by 5 per cent.\n\nChicken prices are strictly controlled by the Malaysian government. That limits scope for poultry companies to profit from sharp spikes in demand. Meanwhile, feed prices have soared because of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Malaysian ringgit is at a five-year low. Input prices will continue to rise.\n\nAfter domestic consumers have extracted their pound of poultry, Malaysia has a surplus of less than 10 per cent, about half of the historic levels. Food inflation hit over 6 per cent in June, the biggest increase in over a decade. That means the government may tighten price controls. Further export bans cannot be ruled out.\n\nLonger term, Singapore should seek security of chicken rice supply via trading ties to other neighbours. Poultry is Thailand’s biggest food export. The amount rose a tenth last year to a record 4.6mn tonnes. Shares of local producers, including Thaifoods Group, are up a quarter in the past year.\n\nSingapore’s cooks may just have to embrace chilled chickens in place of live or recently-deceased birds.",

    "date": "2022-07-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "Kalwant Singh’s death sentence was settled on a Zoom call.\n\nThe Malaysian watched from prison as his appeal was discussed virtually by three Singapore judges this month. For Singh, convicted of smuggling about 120g of heroin, it was his last chance of a reprieve after spending more than six years on death row. He listened silently as a translator interpreted the discussion.\n\nDespite agreeing to provide evidence to the police, Singh’s appeal was dismissed. He was hanged the following day.\n\nAfter two years without any hangings, Singapore has carried out six executions in 2022, the highest level since 2018, including an intellectually disabled man who was hanged in April. At least another seven prisoners have received execution notices, according to anti-capital punishment activists in the city-state.\n\n“Singapore is not giving us time to digest the previous execution. Suddenly the next one is coming up,” said Sangkari Pranthaman, whose brother Pannir Selvam is on death row. “Pannir is in the danger zone . . . My heart is crying.”\n\nKirsten Han, who has campaigned against the death penalty for more than a decade, suspects more execution notices are being issued because it is running out of space on death row. “It is definitely the worst year I have seen,” she said.\n\nIt could be “very similar to how hospitals clear up beds for more patients. They are clearing up cells for more people who they are going to put on death row”.\n\nSingapore’s dogged commitment to capital punishment has highlighted the regressive policies in one of the world’s most liberal economies, critics said.\n\nFor decades, the affluent city-state has drawn wealthy expatriates with its reputation for safe streets, rule of law and strong legal protections for commercial transactions.\n\nBut its treatment of foreigners convicted of trafficking even small amounts of drugs exposes a darker side of Singapore, activists said.\n\nThe financial hub’s recent revival of the death penalty may also be straining the diplomatic and business relationships on which it depends. Last week, the EU called for an immediate suspension of hangings, warning Singapore that it was a “cruel and inhumane” punishment.\n\n“Governments just should not be in the business of killing people,” British tycoon Richard Branson told Vice News this year, as he called for Singapore not to execute Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, a Malaysian drug trafficker whose supporters said he had an IQ of 69.\n\n“Business leaders do take these things into consideration . . . If you’ve got one country that does the death penalty [and] another that doesn’t do the death penalty, you’ve got a choice of where you’re going to put new offices.”\n\nMultinationals in Singapore still largely avoid the issue, however. Companies including Google and Goldman Sachs have been criticised for backing liberal causes, with the government restricting them from funding the annual gay pride parade in 2016.\n\nSingapore faces little pressure from voters to reverse its stance. A 2016 survey by the National University of Singapore found that 87 per cent of locals were in favour of executions for drug trafficking.\n\nIn the face of rising criticism this year, Singapore has defended capital punishment as protecting lives, arguing that it had a “clear, deterrent effect on drug traffickers”. The home affairs ministry added that the punishment was enforced through a “rigorous legal process with stringent judicial safeguards” and that the courts found Dharmalingam was not disabled.\n\nThe government does not readily disclose details about who is facing execution. Transformative Justice Collective, which supports convicts, said at least 59 people were on death row. Families of prisoners said inmates slept on the floor in isolated cells and could hear the sounds of others being hanged.\n\nFinding lawyers willing to take on execution cases was difficult although campaigners said four executions scheduled for this year have been stayed by legal challenges. Many convicts come from poor backgrounds, often from across the border in Malaysia, and struggle to scrape together the legal fees.\n\n“No lawyer wants to handle this case anymore,” said Nazera Lajim, days before her brother Nazeri was executed for drug trafficking this month. She said Nazeri, who only had a primary school education and became dependent on heroin at 14, had to file his own appeal to the court.\n\nPranthaman, who travels overnight on the bus from Malaysia to see her brother in prison on Saturdays, said she was detained by the police and made to give a statement after posting a drawing on Facebook of the room where she visits him.\n\n“I’m not interested in going to this country anymore, except to visit my brother,” she said. “They claim that they are the safest country. [But] you have no freedom at all.”\n\nThe resurgence of executions, however, has not deterred foreigners from wealthier countries. Far from Changi Prison, expats still throng the central business district.\n\n“It is not my place to tell [Singapore] how to do their business . . . If people are being tried in front of the court of law as expected, then there it is,” said one recent arrival when asked about the executions. “If you don’t like it, there are other places to make yourself at home.”\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nSingapore is not alone in capital punishment laws / From T K Lim, High Commissioner of Singapore, London SW1, UK",

    "blurb": "$4bn hedge fund’s new base will offer haven against invasion and tap south-east Asia markets",
    "date": "2022-07-3100:00:00.0",
    "body": "UG Investment, one of the oldest hedge funds specialising in Chinese markets, is planning to open its first office outside greater China to step up investment in south-east Asia, in a move that would help it guard against the risks from any conflict between China and Taiwan.\n\nThe fund, which manages assets of about $4bn, will open an office in Singapore, according to three people with knowledge of the details. It launched in 1998 and currently operates from Taipei and Shanghai.\n\nTensions between the US and China have increasingly centred on Taiwan, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February fuelling speculation that Beijing could try to annex the democratically governed island in the next few years. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and the Chinese military has significantly increased its activity in the region over the past two years.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of UG’s plans said the risk of invasion was one factor in its decision to open a Singapore office. Other factors included talent retention and recruiting new staff to invest in south-east Asia, one of the people said.\n\nUG’s management, including its chief investment officer Rachel Tsai, are not expected to relocate from Taiwan and the fund will not close its offices in greater China, according to one of the people.\n\nUG’s chief operating officer Brandy Chen, who joined the hedge fund from JPMorgan 13 years ago, visited Singapore in June to look into regulatory licences and office space, the person added.\n\nUG said in response to a request for comment on its opening of a Singapore office that the Financial Times’s information did “not reflect truthfully” its standpoint, but did not elaborate further.\n\nInvestment professionals in the region described the opening of an office in Singapore as a sensible precaution.\n\nOne founder of another investment firm with links to Taiwan and Hong Kong said it was a “prudent move”, but added that he believed the risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan was minimal.\n\n“South-east Asia, especially Vietnam and Indonesia, is where Taiwanese money is generally going in any event,” he added.\n\nSingapore is working to bolster its reputation as a leading financial centre in Asia. Hong Kong has historically been the main hub for global financial services groups in the region, but Beijing’s national security law and draconian pandemic control measures have damaged its reputation.\n\nSingapore launched a new corporate structure in 2020 to encourage hedge funds to move assets.\n\nOne of the people with knowledge of the business described UG as one of the “best-kept secrets” of Asian hedge funds.\n\nThe low-profile fund was launched by Eugene Wang in 1998 with $20mn of seed capital after he left Taiwanese brokerage group Yuanta Securities. It was one of the first hedge funds in Taiwan and one of the earliest foreign investors in Chinese markets.\n\nIt was granted a qualified foreign institutional investor licence shortly after China launched the scheme in 2002, which permitted foreign investors to trade on stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen for the first time.\n\nThis article has been amended since first publication to fully clarify that UG is opening an office in Singapore, not moving to Singapore",

    "body": "Every Thursday night, at an invitation-only event in an upscale Singapore hotel, a small group enjoys a four-course dinner while watching videos about an unfolding environmental crisis.\n\nMenus in the dimly lit room at the JW Marriott are designed to highlight the environmentally destructive impact of industrial cropping and livestock breeding.\n\nCorn is served three ways to evoke deforestation, while a dashi broth is poured over colourful vegetables and seaweed to represent rising sea levels.\n\nThen comes the main dish: chicken nuggets, served with maple waffles and a Chinese-style bao bun. Guests put down their wine glasses, slice the meat carefully into bite-sized pieces and linger on the taste.\n\nThe ceremony is a sign that the nuggets are far more than standard fast-food fare: no chicken died to make them. They were created from stem cells, made by a US start-up and, so far, available only in Singapore.\n\nSilicon Valley foodtech unicorn Eat Just is selling its meat in the world’s only nation to have approved the commercialisation of lab-cultivated chicken.\n\nThe Marriott meal is an early taste of a food technology revolution whose advocates say could feed Asia’s fast-growing population, curb damage to the planet and eventually cost less than traditional meat.\n\n“We could theoretically grow anything that might come from plants or animals, from cells instead,” Isha Datar, executive director of cellular agriculture research institute New Harvest, said in a talk.\n\nFood inflation in Asia, where more than 1.1bn people lacked access to adequate food last year, is hovering near its all-time high and not expected to ease any time soon.\n\nThe region’s population is projected to increase by 700mn in the next three decades. Widening income gaps, supply chain disruptions and extreme climate conditions are causing price surges and accelerating a food security crisis long in the making.\n\nAsia is home to ideas still in early stages of research but potentially transformative in feeding more people, with fewer resources, in the decades to come. Innovations such as lab-grown meat and 3D-printed food are at the forefront of efforts to rethink how, and what, we can feed the region’s next billion.\n\nBy then, meat consumption will increase 18 per cent, but agricultural production will grow only 2 per cent or less, according to a joint report by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the OECD.\n\nAround 65 per cent of the world’s middle class will be living in the region by 2030, according to a report by PwC, Temasek and Rabobank. Total spending on food in Asia is expected to double to $8tn, the report said, adding that “Asia is unable to feed itself”.\n\nThe numbers are opportune for investors with deep pockets and big ambitions. Temasek, a Singapore state-owned investor, has said traditional food solutions can “no longer meet the world’s demands”. It has committed more than $8bn to foodtech since 2013.\n\nSome of that has been poured into Eat Just, which has also received funding from Mitsui & Co and Khosla Ventures, as well as private investors such as Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff.\n\nIn the video: Eat Just’s chicken nugget is served at Loo’s Hainanese Curry Rice in Singapore\n\nValued north of a billion dollars, the company has raised more than $800mn so far. And as food prices have soared, it has received more attention from investors. “In the last three months, I got more phone calls, more emails, more direct messages, more introductions, more interest than I ever had at any time,” Josh Tetrick, co-founder of Eat Just, told Nikkei Asia last month.\n\nOn a sunny Singapore afternoon last autumn, in the trendy heritage neighbourhood of Tiong Bahru known for its famed hawker centre, Loo Kia Chee received a phone call. It was someone from Eat Just offering a limited-time collaboration with its cultivated meat division GOOD Meat, to serve up their nuggets with his curry.\n\n“I was surprised,” Loo recalls. “I was the first one to get picked for doing this in Asia or the whole world,” and “before that, I didn’t know about the cultivated meat”.\n\nThis spring, Loo made history by becoming the world’s first hawker stall to serve lab-made chicken. Customers flocked to Loo’s Hainanese Curry Rice, his popular lunchtime haunt, for the novel treat.\n\nLoo said he thought it tasted “like normal chicken . . . [and the similarity to conventional chicken is] I think 98 per cent”.\n\nAsked if he might make the cultivated meat his signature dish some day, Loo seemed receptive to the idea. “If the price challenges [that of conventional meat],” he said, “I will use it.”\n\nAnimal agriculture in the Asia-Pacific region is responsible for 14.5 per cent of global warming, according to the FAO — more than the transportation sector. It also consumes a significant portion of the region’s land and water.\n\nAdvocates for food technology argue it could play a crucial role in easing these problems.\n\n“Foodtech has the potential to . . . reduce the pressure on land usage from crop and animal agriculture, reduce water consumption, increase yields to meet demands without resource limitation and improve the nutritional profile of products,” said Gautam Godhwani, managing partner of Good Startup, which invests in alternative protein companies.\n\nEat Just is among the pioneers of these technologies.\n\nLab-grown chicken is created from cells from a biopsy, an egg or even a feather.\n\nThe meat grows as the cells multiply in a stainless steel tank called a bioreactor. They feed on a broth that contains nutrients like carbohydrates, amino acids, minerals, fats and vitamins. “Instead of growing the entire animal, we only grow what is eaten,” Eat Just said in a statement.\n\n“This means we use fewer resources . . . completing growth in weeks rather than months or years. Then, the harvested product can be used by chefs in multiple final formats, from less structured crispy chicken nugget bites, savoury chorizo and sausages, to more textured products such as shredded chicken or grilled chicken breast.”\n\nEat Just has offered to consumers iterations aside from the nugget, including satay, or grilled chicken skewers.\n\nStill, these remain early days for the industry. Even foodies in Singapore, the world’s only country to approve the sale of lab-grown meat, will have to wait a few years until Eat Just’s meat is readily available at the city-state’s famed street-food hawker stalls.\n\nEat Just’s samples are available through invitation-only events, pop-up tastings and limited offers of food delivery.\n\nA Nikkei Asia reporter invited to the Marriott tasting in Singapore said the nuggets differed only slightly from traditional meat in that they were “unnaturally smooth” while also being softer and less chewy. He said the satay, served up for the first time in May, looked and tasted even closer to traditional chicken than the nuggets.\n\n“A very concrete goal of our company is to, in our lifetime, have a system where the majority of meat doesn’t require slaughter and deforestation,” said Tetrick, best known in the US for commercialising a liquid “egg” product made from protein-rich mung beans.\n\nHis company is also working on beef. The red meat is the top driver of deforestation, according to conservation organisation WWF, causing more than double the forest conversion generated by the next more damaging crops such as soy, palm oil and wood.\n\nMeat production is moving out of abattoirs and into laboratories.\n\nCurrently producing less than 1,000kg of cultivated chicken a year, Eat Just is planning a new facility in Singapore that will help scale to tens of thousands of kilogrammes annually, Tetrick said.\n\nAny research funded and developed in Singapore could be scaled up to help feed the rest of Asia, where a fast-growing population is coping with rising rates of hunger and malnourishment in the face of surging food prices.\n\nMore than 489mn people in Asia were severely food insecure last year, meaning that they had run out of provisions. That is an increase of 112.3mn people in two years in this region alone.\n\nFood prices are expected to keep rising not only in Singapore, but across the region, making self-reliance the latest buzzword.\n\nIt is no accident that Singapore is among the first to embrace cultured meat.\n\nLong popular for its gastronomy, the city-state has scarce farming land and imports more than 90 per cent of its food.\n\nHit by its highest food inflation rate since 2012, the small island nation aims to produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. Given that only 1 per cent of its land is used for conventional farming, the metropolis has decided to invest heavily in technology-based approaches.\n\nAlternative proteins, including lab-cultivated meat, today account for 2 per cent of the global meat market. But they could reach 11 per cent, or $290bn, by 2035, according to a joint report by Boston Consulting Group and Blue Horizon.\n\n“By 2035, every tenth portion of meat, eggs and dairy eaten around the globe is very likely to be alternative. And this is a pretty conservative scenario,” according to Boston Consulting Group and Blue Horizon.\n\nAchieving parity with animal proteins on taste, texture and, most importantly, price, is a tall order, but one the joint report said is plausible in the next 10 years.\n\nSome industry groups have dismissed the forecast as too optimistic, given people’s attachment to traditional meats and the nascency of the technology.\n\n“It requires a lot of capital,” Eat Just’s Tetrick said. “It requires investors to understand that there’s risk associated with that capital and investors who realise that there’s an opportunity for very high return, and also there is meaning in going after an urgent problem.”\n\nInvestors are listening. Foodtech — ranging from lab-grown meat to indoor urban farms — received a record $12.8bn in venture investment last year, double the amount a year earlier, according to Crunchbase.\n\nNearly half of that went to companies creating alternatives to traditionally produced meat, seafood and dairy products.\n\nRethinkX is an independent think-tank that analyses the speed and scale of technology-driven disruption and its implications across society.\n\nFoodtech advocates emphasise that the dietary changes required are neither as radical, nor repellent, as critics claim. For example, we can still consume dairy but will not have to do it directly from animals. In other words, we could have our buttery cake and eat it, too.\n\nBiotech start-up TurtleTree creates milk components from cells. Like Eat Just, the company operates in both California and Singapore — a popular arrangement that allows foodtech businesses access to Silicon Valley capital and the Asian city’s regulatory support.\n\nBy encouraging host cells to produce milk ingredients in bioreactors, TurtleTree hopes eventually to create dairy offshoots such as cream, cheese and butter. Precision fermentation allows humans to programme micro-organisms to produce almost any complex organic molecule.\n\nTurtleTree, which has raised nearly $40mn since its launch in 2019, plans to commercialise its cell-cultured milk ingredients in the near future. It is now working on lowering the cost of producing lactoferrin, a protein known to benefit gut health and support the immune system.\n\nLactoferrin from cattle is costly, with market prices fluctuating between several hundred dollars to $2,000 per kilogramme. This means the protein is deployed only in specialised areas such as infant nutrition, leaving broader uses like everyday food and adult nutrition untapped.\n\n“Our goal is to develop this functional protein sustainably and eventually cost-efficiently . . . which will enable everyone to enjoy the benefits of lactoferrin through everyday nutrition,” said Lin Fengru, TurtleTree co-founder and chief executive.\n\n“It is exciting to envision a future where these [dairy] bioreactors could be dropped anywhere in the world where there was a crisis or need for food,” said Fengru.\n\nInvestors are excited, too. Good Startup has bought stakes in both TurtleTree and Eat Just. Godhwani forecasts that increasing competition among foodtech businesses will further speed up innovation.\n\n“The whole of the cow milk industry . . . will start to collapse once modern food technologies have replaced the proteins in a bottle of milk — just 3.3 per cent of its content,” executives at the think-tank RethinkX said in a report.\n\nBut experts are divided on whether foodtech can make a dent in the traditional meat market.\n\nOthers are less sceptical, citing the influence of demographic changes. “In 2050, the generation after Gen Z will be the main group of consumers. They will be environmentally conscious, so consumption trends will probably be very different from now,” said Seiichi Kizuki, research director at Mitsubishi Research Institute.\n\n“One of our test models suggests that the foodtech industry will grow into a ¥279tn [$2tn] market by 2050. Meat substitutes will possibly have the biggest share.”\n\nKizuki did warn that high production costs were a bottleneck. “How to reduce costs, and be able to provide high-quality, safe food will be key,” he said.\n\nBack in Singapore, Shiok Meats co-founders Sandhya Sriram and Ka Yi Ling are developing lab-cultivated seafood they hope will hit shelves in 2023.\n\n“Many thought Ka Yi and I were crazy for leaving behind well-paid jobs to do this,” Sriram told Nikkei Asia at a meeting in Tokyo. Even though both were accomplished stem cell biologists, raising capital for the world’s first company to work on cell-based crustaceans was challenging without a male co-founder in a venture capital world notorious for its sexism.\n\nStill, within six months of its founding in 2018, Shiok Meats raised about $5mn and launched its prototype: eight shrimp dumplings that cost $5,000 to make.\n\nSince then, Shiok has raised more than $30mn, with backers including Japanese packaging maker Toyo Seikan Group Holdings, South Korean food delivery platform Woowa Brothers and Vietnamese seafood exporter Vinh Hoan Corporation.\n\nA kilogramme of Shiok shrimp now costs $50, significantly lower than four years ago but still sharply higher than the market price of roughly $11 for traditional frozen shrimp in Singapore.\n\nSriram, a high-octane 36-year-old of Indian descent, said she was stirred by the world’s first lab-grown burger patty in 2013. “I was inspired to develop the technology in Asia with seafood, the most-loved protein in this part of the world,” she said, adding that cost parity is a goal but will take time.\n\nLast year, the alternative protein company bought a 90 per cent stake in Gaia Foods, which uses stem cell technology to produce red meat in a laboratory. This added cell-based pork, beef and mutton to Shiok’s portfolio of shrimp, lobster and crab.\n\nShiok is targeting Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, subject to regulatory approvals. Sriram also said she hoped Singapore would inspire foodtech policy in India, the country of her heritage and one that accounts for a quarter of the world’s food-insecure population.\n\n“Growing up as a vegetarian because of ethical boundaries, I never imagined we would be able to opt for cruelty-free, sustainable seafood,” said Sriram, who hopes her 8-year-old son will grow up in a world where fewer animals would have to be killed for food.\n\nIn the video: Shiok samples its lab-cultivated lobster in gazpacho and terrine, and its lab-grown shrimp in beet spheres\n\nFrom beautiful desserts to marbled steak, foodtech pioneers are also experimenting with 3D-printed food.\n\n3D printing is a process in which materials are added layer by layer in a controlled, sequential manner to build up geometrically complex objects. Typically, food grade syringes hold the printing material, which is then deposited through nozzles.\n\nCustomising ingredients allows the tailoring of flavour, texture, colour, portion size, nutrients, calories and digestibility. One researcher gave the example of a vending machine in a gym that could use data obtained during exercise to make a personalised nutrition bar.\n\nShanghai-based agriculture start-up CellX is using advanced 3D-printing technology to create meat in a laboratory.\n\nThe potential is immense in the world’s most populous nation, and one with a voracious appetite for pork. CellX makes its version by harvesting cells from native black pigs.\n\nThe company, which has raised $15mn since its founding in 2020, is also working on beef and poultry.\n\n“Cellular agriculture uses significantly fewer resources and emits less carbon,” said Ziliang Yang, co-founder and chief executive of CellX.\n\nChina this year introduced lab-grown meat and alternative proteins to its five-year agricultural development plan.\n\n“We need to expand from traditional crops, livestock and poultry to more diverse biological resources, develop biotechnology, the bio-industry and get the proteins, calories from plants, animals and microorganisms,” President Xi Jinping said.\n\nChina’s food safety agency has been cautious about approvals, though. It is waiting for more studies and watching how things unfold as more countries approve the sale of lab-cultivated meat.\n\nOther challenges include scale, cost, market education and consumer acceptance.\n\nCellX has managed to cut the price of culturing cells by more than 90 per cent in the past two years.\n\nFounders Joanna Hui and Kenny Fung teamed up at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2019 to develop a patented nozzle that generates fibrous textures for plant-based meat products.\n\n“Our first target is to make plant-based products, but the technology allows us to adjust the 3D-printed food to be most textures from chewy to crunchy and so on,” Fung said. “The plant-based market is our first target as it is growing really fast and has the scale and innovation to support our simultaneous growth as well.”\n\nAlt Farm will use a blend of pea, soy and algae protein for the “Wagyu”. The protein will be printed with fats and flavourings to re-create one of the world’s most expensive cuts of meat. Coconut, shea and cocoa butter will replicate the famous marbling. An initial prototype is slated for 2023.\n\nToday, food printers are used commercially only in gourmet dining, molecular gastronomy restaurants and ambitious bakeries.\n\n“3D-food printing along with cellular agriculture holds great promise in relieving the pressure on industrial farming to meet the global food demand,” Nadiah Ghazalli, consultant for chemicals, materials and nutrition at US researcher Frost and Sullivan, told Nikkei.\n\n“We are still at a proof-of-concept stage, and much of it is targeted for specific uses such as texture enhancement,” she noted.\n\nThe degree of control allows for high levels of customisation, paving the way for personalised nutrition in industries with the most imminent need, such as hospitals, senior-care facilities and hospices.\n\nScientists at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore are working on 3D-printed soft food to help people who struggle to process solid food.\n\n“It’s all meat [cooked chicken paste],” said Anirudh Agarwal, a research associate working on the technology. “We are also trying to make sure that . . . the ingredients being used have fibres that are proven to show some improvement in the digestive tract.”\n\nAnother dimension of the foodtech revolution is the war on waste.\n\nRoughly a third of food is thrown away, according to the UN Environment Programme, because of shortcomings in production, distribution and, most importantly, storage.\n\nIn China alone, enough food to feed 200mn people is squandered annually, UNEP estimates.\n\nThis also means producers have to raise prices to compensate for their unsold stock.\n\nA few years ago, when Masayuki Kinoshita was enjoying fresh mangosteen on the streets of a small village in Thailand, it was these concerns that led to an epiphany.\n\nThe Japanese entrepreneur spent the following weeks obsessing over how to import the fruit into his home country without losing its taste. At the same time, he was also troubled by the fact that Thais discarded massive amounts of fresh fruit because of a lack of storage options.\n\nFrozen food degrades because of ice crystals that expand during cold storage. These can damage a product’s quality by causing the walls of its cells to rupture.\n\nKinoshita’s answer was to found Daybreak in 2013. The company uses advanced flash-freezing technology to minimise ice crystal formation. Its freezers can frost fish to its core in about an hour, Kinoshita told Nikkei Asia, compared with the seven hours it can otherwise take. Then the fish can be stored at optimal quality for about two months, compared with two or three weeks otherwise.\n\nClients use Daybreak’s speciality freezers for everything from fish to fruit.\n\nDaybreak’s technology can flash-freeze fruit and store it for up to three years at optimal quality.\n\nThe company is now working on ramen and sushi.\n\n“We talk about food waste in the context that it is not good and it has to be stopped for our future. But in addition to that is the fact that this waste is hurting food producers,” Kinoshita told Nikkei Asia. “Producers cannot survive if they can’t sell their products [quickly] and cannot earn a living in this low-margin, high-turnover system.”\n\nThe idea that new technologies could save humanity from itself has become a trope of radical solutions to problems from global heating to overpopulation. But the food science revolution has a practicality and immediacy missing in ideas such as building colonies on Mars. If it succeeds, it could change a culture of eating perhaps as profoundly as when humanity shifted from hunter-gathering to settled farming.\n\n“We ultimately want it to be at or below the cost of conventional meat,” Eat Just’s Tetrick said. “We’ve got to invest in infrastructure, the bioreactor, engineering, to make it at that scale.”\n\n“In the next 40 years or so, I’d like to know that the majority of the meat consumed on the planet . . . doesn’t require the slaughter of animals,” the 42-year-old said. “I think within my lifetime, we can turn the corner on it and then pass the baton to the next generation for them to finish the job.”\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on July 23. ©2022 Nikkei Inc.

    "body": "Singapore state fund GIC is directing money towards real estate and other inflation-protecting assets as it prepares for several years of disruption from rising prices.\n\nGIC’s management said in an interview with the Financial Times that soaring inflation could reverse gains it had made in recent years and warned that the world could face an extended period of stagflation if policymakers did not take appropriate action.\n\nThe warning from GIC, whose assets are estimated by analysts to exceed $700bn, reflects the potential impact rising prices could have on institutional investors who have for years capitalised on accommodative monetary policies.\n\nThe prospect of stagflation is particularly concerning to GIC, whose mandate from the government is to deliver inflation-beating returns over the long term and increase the purchasing power of Singapore’s foreign reserves.\n\n“We could be staring at a prolonged period of difficulty. [Stagflation] could last as long as a decade,” said chief executive Lim Chow Kiat, referring to the painful mix of high prices and low growth.\n\nInflation could “reverse a lot of those gains” made by the GIC since it launched in 1981, he said. He would not comment on how many years’ worth of returns he expected could be wiped out.\n\nLim was speaking ahead of the release of GIC’s annual results on Wednesday, which showed that the fund delivered an average annual return of 4.2 per cent above inflation over the past 20 years. This figure, its main performance metric, was a dip from the 4.3 per cent recorded a year earlier.\n\nGIC, which does not disclose the total value of its assets, increased its exposure to real estate from eight to 10 per cent of its portfolio in the year to March. Its allocation to equities dropped two percentage points to 30 per cent of its overall investments.\n\nThe report followed a string of international property acquisitions over the past year, including the Paddington Central office estate in London and at least two providers of student housing in Europe.\n\nShort-term rental properties, such as office buildings and student housing, are less exposed to rising inflation because they can increase prices accordingly, said chief investment officer Jeffrey Jaensubhakij.\n\n“We need to work extremely hard to try to find the assets that we think will be able to survive any near repetition” of the prolonged inflation of the 1970s, he said.\n\nHe said a repeat of this period would be a “worst case” scenario, adding that central banks now have a greater understanding of the problem.",

    "date": "2022-07-2400:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore is lobbying its largest technology companies to relist in the city-state, arguing it is their “national duty” in an escalation of the financial hub’s bid to boost the appeal of its stock market.\n\nOver the past year, exchange officials have intensified attempts to persuade Singapore-based companies, including tech conglomerate Sea and superapp Grab, to return after completing initial public offerings in the US, said people familiar with the discussions.\n\nOfficials have previously promoted the benefits of a secondary listing on the Singapore stock exchange to Sea, pitching it as an opportunity to be included on local stock indices and benefit from extra fund flows, one of the people said. But more recently, the company has been pressured to fulfil its “national duty” to the city-state, they added.\n\nSingapore’s patriotic pitch underlines its struggle to lure more high-profile listings to its stock exchange, despite the financial hub in recent years emerging as a popular incubator for tech companies such as Sea, which owns ecommerce app Shopee and popular online game Free Fire.\n\nSea and Grab have considered homecoming share sales, following similar moves by Chinese tech companies in Hong Kong. But SGX has been mired in low trading volumes and accounting scandals that have prompted delistings, while the global tech market rout this year has diminished the appeal of pursuing another flotation.\n\nOne finance industry professional in Singapore said there had been an overt effort to pressure overseas-listed businesses since early this year.\n\nGrab, a ride-hailing and food delivery app that completed a $40bn listing in New York in December, has also been targeted, the person said. Its merger with a special purpose acquisition company was the biggest of its kind globally.\n\nA person close to Sea, a $39.8bn business that debuted in New York in 2017, said SGX officials have requested meetings with the company as frequently as every few months.\n\nSingapore’s charm offensive comes after a handful of start-ups in neighbouring Indonesia opted to list locally for their IPO. Jakarta has lured businesses away from more developed markets with looser regulations, such as allowing dual-class shares that give founders greater control of their companies.\n\nWhen GoTo, the country’s biggest tech start-up, listed in Jakarta in April, chief executive Andre Soelistyo said he would “like to express our gratitude to the government of Indonesia . . . for their continued commitment to the growth of Indonesia’s digital economy”.\n\nBut the person close to Sea said the company was unlikely to bow to pressure from Singapore. In May last year, Sea was allowed to enter MSCI’s index of Singaporean companies after the index provider said foreign-listed businesses were eligible.\n\nAs with Grab, Sea’s stock has plunged more than three quarters over the past 12 months amid a broader tech stock sell-off, further damping the incentive to raise money at its current valuation.\n\nGrab and Sea declined to comment. SGX did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "blurb": "Singapore dollar has outperformed the euro, which is down 11% this year ",
    "date": "2022-07-1900:00:00.0",
    "body": "South and south-east Asian currencies are outperforming their developed-nation peers as economic reopening and swift central bank action have helped offset the impact of a stronger US dollar.\n\nIndonesia’s rupiah and Singapore’s dollar — the top performers in the region — have fallen less than half as much as the euro, which is down 11 per cent this year against the US currency.\n\nWhile the Bank of Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy has pushed the yen down 17 per cent against the dollar, tightening by India’s central bank has limited the rupee’s drop to less than 7 per cent.\n\nThose moves have come as the Federal Reserve has taken aggressive action in recent months to raise interest rates in a bid to tackle red-hot inflation. That vigorous policy stance has propelled the dollar higher and weighed heavily on the currencies of developed and emerging markets.\n\nBut several south and south-east Asian countries got in ahead of the Fed, meaning that their currencies have fallen only about 7 per cent on average in the year to date, according to Financial Times calculations based on Bloomberg data, compared with an average drop of more than 11 per cent for a range of European currencies.\n\n“In 2013, a lot of the currencies that got hit by the taper tantrum, their fundamentals were poorer,” said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief economist at Bank of Singapore, referring to the market tumult that followed then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke indicating a planned withdrawal of the central bank’s bond-buying programme.\n\nHe added that many central banks had been quicker to tighten policy or even pre-empt the Fed, while the current account deficits that left the region so vulnerable in the past were far less of a concern.\n\n“That gives a shield to these countries in terms of their exchange rates,” Mohi-uddin said, adding that long-delayed economic reopenings throughout the region were also adding strength.\n\nThe region’s outperformance comes despite substantial differences in monetary policy and the impact of surging commodity prices.\n\nSingapore’s dollar has dropped just 3.5 per cent this year as the Monetary Authority of Singapore has rapidly tightened policy in response to the Fed’s sharp moves.\n\nIrene Cheung, senior Asia strategist at ANZ, said Singapore’s currency had done well “first because of the very aggressive policy stance of the MAS and second the revival we’re seeing in tourism and the telecoms sector”.\n\nShe added that while Singapore was vulnerable to more substantial rises in energy prices already hitting European economies, export-focused countries in the region including Indonesia and Malaysia were actually benefiting from higher commodity prices.\n\n“The [Indonesian] rupiah has weakened but it’s not even as bad as the start of the pandemic,” said Cheung. She added that while Indonesia’s central bank had yet to raise rates this year, it was still running a “very good trade surplus” thanks to exports of commodities including natural gas and palm oil.\n\nResilience for the Indonesian and Malaysian currencies is backed up by investment flows this year. High-frequency data from JPMorgan on non-resident portfolio flows into local markets show net purchases of $5.4bn and $1.3bn, respectively, of Indonesian and Malaysian securities. In contrast, foreign investors have dumped about $29bn of Indian stocks and bonds.\n\nYet even India’s rupee, which this week neared a record low of Rs80 to the dollar, is only down about 7 per cent compared with the free-falling yen.\n\nA widening current account deficit has put pressure on the rupee, India’s finance ministry said in its latest monthly report, with the country’s foreign exchange reserves declining by $34bn from January to June amid high global energy costs and surging demand for gold.\n\n“As long as we’re depreciating in line with other emerging markets currencies the [Reserve Bank of India] should be OK with it,” said Jayesh Mehta, country treasurer for India at Bank of America.\n\nHe added that India’s current account deficit was still within a manageable range and the central bank was unlikely to resort to large-scale intervention as it did in 2013.\n\n“I don’t think they’ll need to do that,” Mehta said, “but that is a backstop — you have the ultimate firepower there.”",

    "date": "2022-07-1500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Gotabaya Rajapaksa has resigned as president of Sri Lanka, marking the downfall of one of Asia’s most powerful political dynasties less than a week after the 73-year-old was forced to flee by a popular revolt.\n\nSri Lanka’s parliamentary speaker said on Friday that he had accepted the president’s resignation. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena added that Rajapaksa had sent the letter from Singapore on Thursday evening.\n\n“Accordingly the president has resigned with effect from July 14,” Abeywardena said.\n\nHe said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would remain as acting president until a new head of state was elected.\n\nRajapaksa flew to Singapore on Thursday after initially fleeing Sri Lanka on a military jet to the Maldives without making good on his promise to resign, as a wave of protests over economic collapse had rocked the island nation.\n\nSingapore’s foreign ministry earlier issued a short statement confirming that Rajapaksa had been permitted to enter the city-state on a “private visit”, adding that he had not asked for asylum.\n\nRajapaksa left Sri Lanka after tens of thousands of people massed in Colombo and over-ran his official residence and other public buildings last weekend as public anger over shortages and soaring inflation boiled over.\n\nThe mass protests were among the worst bouts of political unrest this year in emerging markets, which are suffering the brunt of higher food and fuel prices and tighter credit caused by the war in Ukraine.\n\nRajapaksa’s delay in tendering his resignation was probably intended to help him retain diplomatic immunity while he sought refuge in a country that would take him in, analysts said.\n\nThyagi Ruwanpathirana, a south Asia researcher at Amnesty International, said Rajapaksa could face prosecution relating to his role in the final, bloody phase of Sri Lanka’s war against Tamil separatists in 2009, when he was defence secretary.\n\nThe UN’s human rights commission last year set up a Geneva-based Sri Lanka accountability project to gather evidence of past alleged human rights abuses in the country, with the intent of future prosecution.\n\nSingapore generally prioritises its economic relations with other countries and tends to remain neutral on foreign politics to avoid controversy. The city-state is also home to a large population of migrant workers from Sri Lanka.\n\nHowever, a former Singaporean official said: “It would be surprising [if Singapore granted Rajapaksa asylum] and even more surprising if he expected sanctuary here.”\n\nIn Colombo, authorities have imposed a curfew starting at noon while the military has urged protesters against resorting to violence. It warned that it was prepared to use force “if the situation deems necessary”.\n\nRajapaksa’s brother Mahinda also occupied the Sri Lanka presidency and, barring a spell in opposition between 2015-2019, the family has ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades.\n\nHowever, they have been blamed for borrowing heavily to build China-backed spending projects and for a series of failed economic policies that caused Sri Lanka to default on its debt in May.",

    "date": "2022-07-1200:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore state-owned fund Temasek, one of the world’s largest investors, reported a sharp drop in returns and warned it would be “cautious” about new investment amid a deteriorating economic outlook.\n\nTemasek said on Monday that downturns in China and the technology sector in particular had weighed down on its performance, with shareholder returns standing at just 5.8 per cent in the 12 months to March, far below the 24.5 per cent recorded for the previous year.\n\nThe results underline how a sudden reversal in markets has set back investors who had enjoyed years of rapid growth. Over the past decade, the value of Temasek’s portfolio has more than doubled to S$403bn ($287bn) largely thanks to its big bets on China and tech.\n\n“Against these global uncertainties, our investment approach remains cautious,” said Lim Ming Pey, managing director of Temasek’s strategy office, highlighting the impact of the war in Ukraine, slowing economic growth and rising inflation.\n\n“In view of the current environment, we expect to slow down our investment pace this financial year,” Lim said.\n\nTemasek said the total value of its investments in the technology, media and telecoms industry had dropped from 14 per cent to 7 per cent of its total portfolio.\n\nTemasek’s investments in China, which previously made up the biggest chunk of its portfolio, also took a hit, with the value of its investments in the country decreasing from 27 per cent to 22 per cent of its overall holdings. The total value of its investments in Singapore now exceeds those in China, where markets continue to be hit by severe lockdowns.\n\nBut Temasek said it was still committed to investing in the Chinese market.\n\nChief investment officer Rohit Sipahimalani told a briefing that “most of the regulatory headwinds are behind us” and that a Chinese government campaign targeting the country’s largest tech companies that had wiped billions off the stock market was “nothing new”.\n\n“Around the world, they are concerned about the power of big tech companies, they are concerned about data issues. It’s just the pace of change that we saw in China was faster than what anyone expected,” Sipahimalani said.\n\nTemasek, whose funds are largely sourced from the return on its own investments, continued to increase its holdings over the year, making a net investment of S$24bn.\n\nIt made new investments in the crypto industry, including popular exchange FTX, despite Singapore officials recently indicating they would harden their stance on the sector following a crypto market crash.\n\nBlockchain is “going to touch lots of different parts of business”, said Martin Fichtner, Temasek’s deputy head of technology and consumer investments. “Our exposure to cryptocurrencies is minimal . . . We are focused on, more broadly, the applications of the technology and the opportunities that are going to emerge from that.”",

    "body": "Australian energy start-up Sun Cable has hired investment banks Macquarie and Moelis to raise more than A$30bn (US$20.6bn) over the next 18 months to fund a giant solar farm and the world’s longest undersea power cable.\n\nIt will be the first time an Australian renewables development worth tens of billions of dollars goes to capital markets for full project funding.\n\nThe project is expected to test investor faith in the idea that Australia, a leading fossil fuel exporter, can also be a significant clean energy exporter.\n\nSun Cable plans to build about 20 gigawatts of solar capacity and 40GWh of battery storage in remote northern Australia, along with a 4,200km undersea cable to Singapore.\n\nIt is backed by Australian billionaires Andrew Forrest, chair of iron miner Fortescue Metals, and Mike Cannon-Brookes, co-founder of software company Atlassian, who are both outspoken proponents of Australia’s clean energy export potential.\n\nSun Cable stands alongside the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, a 26GW wind and solar farm planned for Western Australia, as one of the country’s most ambitious clean energy developments. Oil major BP took a leading stake in the AREH last month.\n\nNeither project has begun construction, but Sun Cable, which last month was declared “investment ready” by the Australian government, is at a more advanced stage of development and has targeted completion for 2029.\n\nUnlike the AREH, which plans to use solar and wind to manufacture green hydrogen for export, Sun Cable plans to export only electricity.\n\nSun Cable chief executive David Griffin said that when the project was completed, the cable would be the longest undersea power line in the world, dwarfing the 720km North Sea Link, which connects the UK and Norway.\n\nThe project’s viability relies on being granted a licence by Singapore’s Energy Market Authority, which has called for tenders from clean energy producers to supply 4GW of continuous reliable supply to the city-state by 2035.\n\nSun Cable wants to supply half of that energy but will probably face competition from south-east Asian power producers. In the first round of bids, in which Sun Cable did not participate, the EMA said it received 20 bids from power producers in Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nGriffin said the EMA was “100 per cent in control, so they could say anything” but expressed confidence that Singapore’s electricity demand would support the A$30bn project.\n\n“At the moment, they are looking for 4GW of supply, and that’s a big number,” he said. “But electricity demand is not going to stop growing in Singapore.”\n\nGriffin said the company needed to secure contracts with power purchasers and was talking to customers in Singapore.\n\nSingapore’s current electricity generation capacity is 12GW, more than 90 per cent of which comes from gas, according to the EMA.\n\nDavid Leitch, a Sydney-based energy analyst and principal at ITK Services, said investors and lenders would want both import licence and binding power purchase agreements before putting up funds.\n\n“The bank is not going to give them money on the hope they will be able to sell the power,” he said. But he said Sun Cable was probably in “pole position” in the EMA’s tender process.\n\nGriffin gave no details on the split between equity and debt but expressed interest in BP’s investment in the AREH.\n\n“The BP angle, and companies like them, they are interesting,” he said.\n\n“Multi-gigawatt scale, multibillion-dollar projects of this nature, that’s the norm for these types of companies. So they actually have quite a lot to bring to the table.”\n\nGriffin said Sun Cable was planning other undersea cables linking Australia, with its huge solar and wind resources, to Asia, but gave no further details.",

    "body": "Singapore will be “brutal and unrelentingly hard” on bad behaviour in the crypto industry, according to its fintech policy chief, marking a stark shift in rhetoric after years of the city-state courting the sector.\n\nSopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country’s central bank, questioned the value of private cryptocurrencies and said he expected a state-backed alternative to be launched within three years.\n\n“We have been called out by many cryptocurrencies for not being friendly,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “My response has been: friendly for what? Friendly for a real economy or friendly for some unreal economy?”\n\nMohanty added: “We have no tolerance for any market bad behaviour. If somebody has done a bad thing, we are brutal and unrelentingly hard.”\n\nThe crypto meltdown has hardened the stance of officials in Singapore, where many crypto businesses had been set up because of the perceived friendly regulatory environment and low taxes.\n\nBut crypto exchanges including Bybit and Binance have shunned the city-state in recent months as the MAS started rolling out increasingly restrictive rules.\n\nMohanty was speaking as South Korean prosecutors narrowed in on Singapore-based Terraform Labs, the company behind the collapsed stablecoin terraUSD and its twin token luna.\n\nIn the aftermath of luna’s $40bn wipeout, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, headquartered in Singapore, was also plunged into a crisis after failing to meet margin calls.\n\n“I think the world at large is lost . . . in private currency, which is causing all this market turmoil,” said Mohanty.\n\nHe said Singapore has enforced a “painfully slow” and “extremely draconian due diligence process” for licensing crypto businesses.\n\nSingapore has approved few applications for a licence to operate a crypto business.\n\nCrypto.com, a cryptocurrency trading platform, on Wednesday received in-principle approval to operate. Crypto.com has also received a licence in Dubai and plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange service there.\n\nBut Mohanty’s comments suggested that some crypto businesses may face an uncertain future in Singapore.\n\nThis week, the MAS co-launched a “centre of excellence” in the city-state to work on the development of a central bank digital currency, a concept that several countries are exploring to potentially wrest control of online payments from crypto businesses.\n\nLed by software developer Mojaloop and backed by Singapore state fund Temasek, the group hopes to implement the digital currency in a system that enables low-cost international payments.\n\nMohanty said his “best bet” was that a digital currency would be integrated into the platform within “a few years”, adding that it would not be exclusive to Singapore and would be available to other central banks.\n\n“We are relentlessly focused on the infrastructure of the future economy, which can be based on a digital asset,” he said.",

    "blurb": "Big regional economies are roaring back after lifting burdensome Covid curbs that strangled growth",
    "date": "2022-06-2100:00:00.0",
    "body": "War in Ukraine, record fuel and food prices and rising interest rates are stoking the threat of stagflation but at least one region is positioned to avoid the worst of the downturn: south-east Asia.\n\nAcross the globe, investors are selling stocks in anticipation of higher interest rates and potential recession. The US Federal Reserve last week raised rates by more than expected in a bid to tame prices while China’s punitive zero-Covid strategy has depressed demand in the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nSouth-east Asia, however, looks set to largely escape the stagflationary cycle of high inflation and cratering output. In four of the six biggest economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, gross domestic product is rising faster than inflation, a Financial Times analysis of government data has found.\n\nIn those countries — Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines — economies are bouncing back as strict pandemic entry controls are removed and a resurgence of tourism fills hotels in hotspots ranging from Vietnam’s Ha Long Bay to Bali.\n\n“What you are seeing in south-east Asia at the moment is a reopening bounce coming through: the growth environment is very strong, and that is likely to carry over into the second half of the year,” said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC. “Asean is looking very resilient.”\n\n“There’s not a lot of talk about stagflation here,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research for ANZ in Singapore. “One of the bright spots is that south-east Asian countries have embraced treating Covid as endemic, and have really moved on and eased restrictions and opened up their economies.”\n\nOnly in Thailand and Singapore has inflation climbed faster than gross domestic product growth. Thailand’s economy is rebounding, but rising inflation is dampening consumer demand, while Singapore last month warned that its recovery was slowing because of the impact of the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China, its leading trading partner.\n\nAround the region, the positive numbers partly reflect the “base effect” of bounce backs from deep economic downturns during the pandemic.\n\nIn the Philippines, which suffered one of the sharpest economic contractions of any country in the region after imposing hard lockdowns to contain Covid, GDP rose 8.3 per cent in the first quarter, sparked by a revival in consumption.\n\nBut south-east Asian economies are generating greater momentum in output, too, including steady growth in exports. Rising food, fuel and commodity prices have been good for the countries that export them in large quantities, whether palm oil (Indonesia and Malaysia), rubber (Thailand and Malaysia) or coal (Indonesia).\n\nSouth-east Asian countries are also positioned to profit from shifts in production by manufacturers diversifying their supply chains away from China. Apple, for example, is shifting some of its production of iPads to Vietnam.\n\n“Vietnam’s acceleration of manufacturing activities reflects its ability to substitute some of the loss of production in China because of zero-Covid supply-chain disruptions, especially in electronics, textiles and footwear,” said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for emerging Asia with Natixis, a bank.\n\n“The persistence of disruption in China and rising geopolitical tensions will further increase investment into south-east Asia.”\n\nWhile Asean economies are generally performing well, some are more vulnerable to darkening global trends. The Philippines, for example, relies partially on imports for rice, a staple, and is a net importer of food and fuel. It is therefore not benefiting from the improved terms of trade enjoyed by food and fuel exporters such as Thailand and Singapore.\n\nPolicymakers in the region are, however, in some cases embracing price controls — a move that could soften the shock of inflation. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, the new Philippine president who assumes power at the end of the month, promised during the campaign to bring down the price of rice by imposing a cap on the grain.\n\n“In south-east Asia, some prices are controlled — for example, petrol in Malaysia and Indonesia — and that helps to keep headline inflation contained,” said ANZ’s Goh. “We are not seeing a large breakout in inflation like in the US or Europe.”",

    "blurb": "Lloyd Austin warns China against ‘provocative’ activity at Asian defence forum",
    "date": "2022-06-1100:00:00.0",
    "body": "US defence secretary Lloyd Austin accused China of stepping up coercive behaviour towards Taiwan as he stressed that Washington would maintain its military capacity to resist any force that threatened the country.\n\nSpeaking at the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue defence forum in Singapore, Austin said China was engaging in provocative behaviour across the Indo-Pacific region that ranged from dangerous naval and aerial manoeuvres to increasingly assertive military activity around Taiwan.\n\n“We’ve witnessed a steady increase in provocative and destabilising military activity near Taiwan,” Austin said on Saturday. “That includes PLA aircraft flying near Taiwan in record numbers in recent months.\n\nAddressing an audience that included General Wei Fenghe, China’s defence minister, Austin said there had been an “alarming increase” in unsafe aerial intercepts and confrontations at sea by Chinese military ships and aircraft.\n\nAustin referred to recent incidents in which Chinese air force fighter jets conducted “dangerous intercepts” in the South China Sea and East China Sea of aircraft flown by US allies — in a reference to Australia and Canada.\n\nSpeaking several weeks after President Joe Biden said in Tokyo that the US would intervene militarily to defend Taiwan from any Chinese attack, Austin said Washington would adhere to the Taiwan Relations Act by ensuring that Taiwan maintained a sufficient defence capability.\n\n“And it means maintaining our own capacity to resist any use of force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardise the security or the social or economic system of the people of Taiwan,” he added.\n\nAustin stressed that US policy towards Taiwan had not changed and that the administration remained opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait — from Taipei or Beijing.\n\nHis comments came as US officials have grown increasingly worried about the Chinese threat to Taiwan, over which China claims sovereignty.\n\nAustin used his speech to highlight the Biden administration’s efforts to boost co-operation with allies, including the Quad — a security group that includes the US, Japan, Australia and India — and the Aukus security pact agreed by the US, UK and Australia last year.\n\nPaul Haenle, director of Carnegie China, a think-tank, said Austin’s speech “struck the right balance”, noting that the US defence secretary said US policy towards Taiwan had not changed while “stressing that key components of that policy are helping Taiwan maintain a sufficient self-defence capability and maintain a robust US capacity to resist any Chinese use of force”.\n\nAustin spoke one day after meeting Wei, in what was the first senior-level meeting between the militaries since Biden assumed office.\n\nDespite putting a positive spin on the meeting between the defence chiefs, China launched a blistering riposte to Austin’s speech.\n\n“The US has already messed up Europe and the Middle East, do they now also want to mess up Asia? We will absolutely not allow that,” said Lieutenant General Zhang Zhenzhong, deputy chief of the Joint Staff Department of China’s Central Military Commission.\n\nIn what the Chinese delegation called Beijing’s official response to Austin, Zhang rejected the US defence secretary’s pledge that Washington was not seeking a new cold war, an Asian Nato or a region split into hostile blocs.\n\n“Their words do not match their deeds,” Zhang said. “The true intention of the US is to use this to maintain their hegemonic system. They are trying to create small circles by roping in some countries.” He added that the US Indo-Pacific strategy was one of geopolitical rivalry and bloc competition.\n\nPointing to the Global Security Initiative, a still-vague security concept proposed by President Xi Jinping in April, Zhang said China was a “sustained contributor to and firm supporter of regional peace” and a provider of public goods, in contrast with the US, which he called the “biggest source of instability” and a “backstage manipulator”.\n\nZhang also warned Washington against further support for Taiwan. The US had “seriously hollowed out and undermined” its pledge to stick to a one-China policy, he said, pointing to Washington’s approval on Wednesday of the sale of $120mn worth of spare parts for warships to Taipei.\n\nSteps taken by the US in the past year were a reminder that Taiwan was the one issue with the biggest potential to lead the geopolitical rivals into conflict, Zhang said, adding: “This is extremely dangerous.”\n\nWei is scheduled to address the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday morning.\n\nMajor General Guo Ruobing, commander of the National Security College at the National Defence University, sharply dismissed Austin’s criticism of Chinese intercepts of Australian and Canadian military aircraft. “They are the ones disturbing stability,” he said, adding that “the US always says one thing but does another”. Washington has repeatedly rejected such Chinese criticism by pointing out that its aircraft fly in international airspace.\n\nAustin outlined three areas where the US was working more closely with allies, including sharing research and development to ensure they had the right capabilities to deter aggression and stepping up exercises and training.\n\nHe added that the US Coast Guard was boosting its presence in the Indo-Pacific, a shift illustrated by the fact that Admiral Linda Fagan was the first Coast Guard commandant to attend the Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\nFollow Demetri Sevastopulo and Kathrin Hille on Twitter",

    "blurb": "Property prices, visa rules and demand for school places are complicating the move for families fleeing China’s restrictions",
    "date": "2022-06-1000:00:00.0",
    "body": "John, a finance worker based in Hong Kong, is not looking forward to moving to Singapore.\n\nThe expatriate, who declines to give his real name or further identifying details, says that he and his family live a “very spoiled existence” in the former British territory, which is coming under increasingly strict Chinese rule.\n\n“I’m staring out at the ocean looking at the pool in front of me as we speak. I know we are not going to have that,” John says during a call from his current home, as he frets about the property market heating up across the South China Sea.\n\n“We are going from a house with a pool, a tennis court, a garden, five bedrooms, to somewhere where we are looking at an apartment, basically,” he says.\n\nYet John feels he has little choice. He is one of many foreign workers who this year have sought to escape Hong Kong’s strict coronavirus pandemic measures. The tough rules have proved to be the final straw for many in the city who had already endured nearly a year of escalating political turbulence before coronavirus arrived in early 2020.\n\nAlthough these restrictions have been gradually eased in recent weeks, a large number had already made the move. Reports earlier this year of parents being separated from their children in hospital wards brought China’s crackdown particularly close to home, pushing many families to pack their bags.\n\nThe most obvious new destination has been Singapore, another Asian finance hub where, in contrast to Hong Kong, business travellers no longer need to quarantine on arrival. Long seen by some as the Chinese city’s smaller and less lively cousin, its appeal was boosted after it started to lift Covid-19 restrictions last autumn. Curbs on holiday travel, restaurants and nightlife have all been dropped sooner than in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the first four months of this year, the number of visitors arriving in Singapore from Hong Kong increased more than 13-fold year-on-year to 13,678, according to official data. The figures include tourists as well as business travellers.\n\nRelocating has not been simple, however. Besides the normal troubles associated with moving, expats have had to contend with rising house prices, unprecedented competition for school places and increasingly stringent visa requirements.\n\nIn March, the Financial Times reported that some of Singapore’s top private schools were receiving up to 15 applications for every one place, as parents fleeing Hong Kong battled to secure a spot. Craig Considine, chief executive of one of the city-state’s most popular international schools, Tanglin Trust School, says demand has remained “very strong” throughout the year. With places so oversubscribed, he adds, new offers will not be made until the end of 2022.\n\nEstate agents are also being bombarded with calls. In the first quarter of this year, an index of private home rents rose 4.2 per cent over the previous period, reaching the highest level since records began, according to Singapore’s government. The authorities provided only an index, rather than raw rent figures. Private home rents in Hong Kong, meanwhile, dropped almost 2 per cent in the first quarter.\n\nMost of the residential towers that trace the Singapore skyline are public housing, with about 80 per cent of residents living in these apartment blocks, leaving new arrivals racing to snap up the much smaller selection of private properties.\n\nAreas favoured by affluent foreigners have become particularly competitive, according to Hari Krishnan, chief executive of Singapore property site PropertyGuru.\n\n“If you wanted a [house] along Bukit Timah near the British school, you’re screwed,” he told the FT earlier this year, referring to a sought-after residential area near downtown Singapore with one of the city’s densest concentrations of private housing.\n\nLeonard Tay, head of research at estate agent Knight Frank’s Singapore office, expects rents to continue rising for up to 15 months. It is “not just the guys from Hong Kong” heating up the market, he adds, pointing to a shortage of housing supply after construction was disrupted during the pandemic.\n\nAs well as Bukit Timah, Tay says the areas around the Orchard Road shopping district and near the beach in East Coast Park have seen particularly high demand.\n\nRelocation headaches have been made more painful by recent government measures to stem the influx of foreign workers. Singapore, typically seen as one of the world’s most open economies, has long welcomed international corporations. But competition for jobs has hardened attitudes against the high-earning migrants who frequent the central business district and pricey bars along nearby Clarke Quay. The government has felt under pressure to respond.\n\nOfficials have raised the base pay required for visas on three occasions in as many years, with a new minimum salary of about $44,000 for professionals coming into force this autumn. For people in their mid-40s, that rises to more than $91,000. With companies saying they are under pressure to favour locals, not every family who might have expected to make the trip has been able to do so.\n\n“[The government] has been very explicit they don’t want us to move more back-office people,” said the Asia head of one international bank last month. “They’re happy for us to have a bigger back-office operation as long as we hire locally.”\n\nDaniel Beatty, who relocated from Hong Kong in September, says his wife has struggled to get a job amid the pushback against foreigners.\n\nBut the business executive himself is reluctant to hire other expats. “I’m looking at the school fees, the rental costs,” he says. “People will be demanding more pay to move here. I’m very reticent to bring even more people to Singapore.”\n\nWesterners have been making the journey to the island cities of Hong Kong and Singapore — separated by a roughly four-hour flight — since as long ago as the 19th century, when both were British colonies. In more recent decades, foreigners in search of fortunes and warmer climes continued to travel to and from the cities’ financial districts where, instead of colonial buildings, glass offices occupied by the world’s largest banks now stand.\n\nBut, despite the two cities’ connections, those recently arriving in Singapore have found living there to be a very different experience.\n\nThe tiny city-state secured independence from British rule in 1959, decades before Hong Kong was handed over to China. Under the uncompromising guidance of its first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, it transformed in a matter of years from a trading outpost with scarce natural resources to a low-tax business centre.\n\nRainforests were razed, as were many of the city’s traditional shophouses — low-rise buildings incorporating residential and commercial spaces. Land was reclaimed from the sea to build more sleek, perpendicular towers. High state funding for housing and healthcare appeased voters, while political dissent was often swiftly stamped out.\n\nThese clampdowns have continued to the present day. In 2020, Singapore charged an activist who stood alone and held up a cardboard sign bearing a drawing of a smiley face with participating in an “illegal public assembly”.\n\nForeigners who avoid such demonstrations often find Singapore to be comfortable, clean and safe, while somewhat lacking the spirit suggested by its moniker, the Lion City. But after witnessing violent street protests and increasing political change in Hong Kong, some are grateful for the predictability of life in Singapore.\n\n“Everyone goes: ‘Hong Kong, Singapore: same, same’. But actually it is not, it is really different,” says Heather Thomas, an American business owner who recently moved from Hong Kong. “The pace of life is a little slower, which is not a bad thing necessarily.”\n\nAnother entrepreneur who arrived this year says that Singaporeans are “still very cautious” about coronavirus restrictions, despite the relaxation of the rules. Like others, he was loath to speak publicly about his new home.\n\n“In Hong Kong it is immediate,” he says of how Hong Kongers responded when coronavirus restrictions were temporarily lifted in previous years. “You open the gyms; the gyms are full.”\n\nThe adjustment to Singapore is also physical. About 2,500km south of Hong Kong, it sits just one degree north of the equator.\n\n“It is brutal,” says the entrepreneur. “[During my first month] here I could not get enough sleep. I was always worn out from the humidity.” He adds: “You order a whisky sour and the ice cube melts in 30 seconds.”\n\nAfter adapting to their more humid and docile new city, many professionals are nevertheless hopeful about their future in Singapore. Thomas, who has run a Pilates exercise business in Hong Kong for 17 years, was already considering an expansion to the city-state before the pandemic struck. The struggles her business faced subsequently pushed her to accelerate those plans and start a new life in Singapore.\n\n“We need to diversify . . . We have been suffering on and off with closures for the last three years,” she says. “[In Singapore], there is a place for classical Pilates and there is an increasingly sophisticated clientele. There is demand [in a space] that has not been occupied yet.”\n\nWith more people like her landing in Singapore, its prospects as a hub for small businesses may be rising.\n\n“It really does seem that [Singapore is now a better place to start a business than Hong Kong],” she says. “And it is an hour and a half to Bali. It’s great.”\n\nUntil he relocated temporarily to Singapore at the start of this year, Covid-19 had loomed large over Phil Krichilsky, who runs a consultancy for businesses in Asia. When word first began to spread of the virus in 2019, he says he was working for a manufacturing client just a two-hour journey away from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus was first detected. From his home in Hong Kong, he has spent much of his time since then navigating Beijing’s unpredictable pandemic policies.\n\nNow, like many who arrived in Singapore this year, he feels liberated simply because he is able to travel freely across the border. “When I was a kid, there was a game called whack-a-mole,” he says. “You knew what was going to come up [but] you didn’t know when . . . The inconsistency [in Hong Kong] makes it next to impossible for business executives to work in the mainland or the rest of the world.” Arriving in Singapore, by contrast, he was “immediately” awed to discover that clearing customs and leaving the airport took only 20 minutes.\n\n“I went out for a walk [and restaurants were inviting me in],” he recalls. “I thought I was going to have a heart attack, man. I thought it was so cool.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Andy Lin\n\nOliver Telling is the FT’s Singapore correspondent\n\nFind out about our latest stories first — follow @FTProperty on Twitter or @ft_houseandhome on Instagram",

    "date": "2022-06-0900:00:00.0",
    "body": "The price of food, energy and other necessities is soaring globally. But in Singapore, the rich still want luxury cars.\n\nPeople in the city-state are paying the highest amount in decades just for the right to own a premium car, official data showed on Wednesday.\n\nThe cost of the most exclusive certificates of entitlement, which residents must obtain before they are allowed to purchase a car, breached six figures in June for the first time in at least 20 years, according to official data.\n\nOpen category COEs, which allow the purchase of vehicles other than motorcycles, rose 5 per cent to S$100,697 (US$73,230) in the most recent round of bidding, compared with the previous auction in mid-May. Certificates for larger cars increased by a similar margin to S$100,684.\n\nThe car market is heating up as prices rise across Singapore, reflecting broader increases in the cost of living globally. Core inflation in the city-state reached 3.3 per cent in April, its highest level since 2012.\n\nThe real household income in Singapore has been hit particularly hard by regional events and the rise in commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMalaysia imposed a sweeping ban on exports of live chickens to protect domestic stocks last week. Singapore imported more than a third of its chicken from Malaysia in 2021, so purveyors of chicken rice, the national dish, have been forced to increase prices as they rush to secure supplies, according to local media.\n\nThe decision was made after Indonesia temporarily banned exports of palm oil, putting pressure on cooking oil prices in Singapore.\n\nMeanwhile, a wave of foreign professionals seeking to escape Hong Kong’s stricter coronavirus pandemic measures has descended on the city-state in recent months, driving up demand and prices for homes. The vast majority of citizens and permanent residents live in public housing, leaving expats racing to compete for the much smaller selection of private properties.\n\nSingaporeans have long faced high fees to acquire COEs, which were introduced to curb traffic. As the price of these certificates can exceed the cost of a typical vehicle, many middle-income residents have been put off car ownership.\n\n“Everyone thinks it is cheaper” in Singapore, said Heather Thomas, a small-business owner who recently relocated from Hong Kong. “I don’t think that at all. I don’t think I would get close to buying a car.”\n\nBut wealthy residents, who are particularly likely to purchase the open category COEs and certificates for larger vehicles, are still seeking out luxury cars.\n\nCertificates have to be renewed every decade and are sold through regular auctions, meaning prices fluctuate according to supply and demand. June’s auction took place three weeks after the previous one, instead of the usual two, so received more bids than normal.\n\n“I am not going to stop collecting,” said one multi-millionaire. It is still “beautiful for rich people” in Singapore.",

    "date": "2022-06-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "At the Migrant Workers’ Centre Recreation Club, about 20km west of Singapore’s central business district, the men who help keep the city-state running spend a weekday evening surrounded by a 2-metre-high fence.\n\nInside, across a sprawling concrete courtyard, vending machines dispense face masks and food stalls offer halal food to south Asian labourers who sip beers on plastic chairs.\n\nMore than two years after Singapore announced its first Covid-19 lockdown, spaces such as this, one of eight so-called recreation centres located on the outer reaches of the island, are the only places where thousands of workers are allowed to freely spend time outside their residences.\n\n“A Singapore citizen, they can access anywhere,” said Dhanu, a technician from India who lives with other migrant workers in a dormitory near the recreation centre. “That’s not fair . . . It’s discrimination.”\n\nTo much fanfare in April, the Singapore government lifted almost all its remaining Covid measures, including restrictions on travel and nightclubs. The city-state’s easing of restrictions has been welcomed by businesses and encouraged high-earning professionals to relocate from stricter cities such as Hong Kong.\n\nBut despite very high vaccination rates, the freedom of many of the island’s poorest workers remains severely curtailed.\n\nOf the roughly 280,000 workers who live in dormitories, a maximum of 25,000 are permitted to travel outside the recreation centres or their workplaces on weekdays — and only on the condition that they tell authorities where they are going and limit their trips to eight hours. On weekends, 50,000 are allowed out.\n\nCampaigners said the government was still using other pandemic measures to control foreign workers.\n\n“The lockdown is still happening for the workers,” said Jolovan Wham, former director of the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics, a support group in Singapore. “But they are allowed to come out to work. So people see them and it perhaps creates the impression they are allowed out to the community.”\n\nSingapore’s work permit holders, who typically come from poorer Asian countries to do domestic and manual labour, form the backbone of the city-state’s economy. At the end of last year, there were about 849,700 work permit holders, compared with just 161,700 foreign professionals and a native population of about 3.5mn.\n\nBut they have long suffered out of sight. Often packed into concrete blocks far from the glass apartment towers in the city centre and working long hours at construction sites or shipyards, their interactions with locals are more regulated than higher-paid foreigners. They even require government approval to marry or start a family with a Singapore citizen.\n\nTheir plight came to international attention two years ago, when Covid-19 spread rapidly through cramped dormitories. By late April 2020, hundreds of foreign workers were becoming infected each day, with Singapore reporting the third-highest number of cases per capita in the world.\n\nThe government responded harshly, quarantining workers in dormitories where more than a dozen men were often packed into one room and as many as 200 shared washing facilities.\n\nBut following widespread reports of attempted suicides by workers confined in such conditions, authorities committed to improving standards. At two new sites announced last September, the number of men in each room will be limited to 12, with each person allowed a minimum space of 4.2 square metres.\n\nDebbie Fordyce, president of support group TWC2, said the new buildings were “better in some ways”. But she also raised concerns that workers were being moved out of normal housing and into dormitories where surveillance had become “much more stringent”.\n\nIn April, the government lifted the requirement for Singaporeans to check-in at most venues using a contact tracing app. But migrants are still required to register at their dormitory rooms twice a day, with employers able to monitor their movements using a separate app, DormWatch.\n\n“It became easier to confine people,” said Fordyce, citing an incident this year when dormitory security initially prevented a man from going to the hospital without his employer’s permission.\n\nAt least 98 per cent of workers living in dormitories are fully vaccinated against Covid, according to the government. But Lawrence Wong, Singapore’s prime minister-in-waiting and co-chair of its Covid task force has defended the restrictions, arguing in comments cited by the local press that they protect migrants.\n\nSingapore’s Ministry of Manpower said applications by migrants to visit the community were approved “almost automatically”. Activities and events had resumed at dormitories and recreation centres, allowing workers to “enjoy their rest days”.\n\n“MOM will continue to provide more flexibility for migrant workers to visit the community,” the ministry said.\n\nDespite the restrictions, wide-eyed workers continue to arrive in Singapore, lured by the hope of a better life. Dhanu, a masters graduate who came this year, said he eventually hopes to do his PhD at a Singapore university.\n\nBut some veteran workers may be losing heart. Sagar, a handyman, said he was still repaying the loan he took out to move to Singapore 14 years ago.\n\nFriends had told Sagar he would earn a high salary in the city-state, but after arriving he was left “crying every day”. “The dream and the reality are not the same,” he said.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nSingapore stands by its record on migrant workers / From TK Lim, Singapore High Commissioner, London SW1, UK",

    "body": "When I was growing up in Singapore, one thing I never found in short supply was the seemingly endless variety of eateries capable of whipping up a satisfying meal at short notice. Famed as both a melting pot of eastern and western cultures and a financial hub, the city-state also wears its reputation as a food haven with pride.\n\nIt’s no surprise, then, that eating is a favoured pastime of Singapore residents. Morning, noon or night, there is hardly an awkward time to feast. A hearty brunch, for instance, is how locals like to indulge between the usual mealtimes. This is especially true on weekends, when you will find everyone from trendy teenagers to young adults, families and expats digging in at a cosy café for hours. One might argue that brunch has edged its way into Singaporean food culture, though I think it has more to do with the plethora of chic places that have opened in recent years, even during the pandemic, to tempt locals’ ever-curious taste buds.\n\nBrunch in Singapore can be anything a foodie might dream of, from traditional local toasts topped with a generous spread of coconut custard jam, known as kaya (also a breakfast favourite) to perfectly poached eggs and fresh salad. Chase those with locally brewed thick coffee or an iced latte (with oat milk, of course). These days, new eateries doing brunch tend to serve western-style fare and have become increasingly popular — you’ll often find queues at peak hours, especially if pictures of a spot have done the rounds on social media. But be prepared for a heftier bill than at Singapore’s ubiquitous food courts, known as hawker centres.\n\nBeyond food, the brunch experience in Singapore is also often tied to the setting. Sometimes the atmosphere is more crucial to your enjoyment than the quality of your meal. With that in mind, below are some suggestions on unique brunch destinations in Singapore — places you should visit if your aim is to while away an afternoon in a district where the sights and sounds are also a feast for your senses.\n\nThe striking red façade that gives this establishment its name is the first thing that will make an impression when you arrive at the Red House. The bakery is situated in eastern Singapore’s heritage-rich Katong neighbourhood, known for its traditional shophouses. The building formerly housed the Katong Bakery & Confectionery, for decades a popular bake shop and breakfast spot, and its new tenant Micro continues the tradition with its excellent pastries.\n\nBut Micro’s offering goes beyond baked goods. This is the place to build your own brunch: start with sourdough toast and French butter, and add whatever else you fancy, such as avocado, sausage, scrambled eggs or roast tomatoes. Lighter fare includes homemade granola with seasonal fruits and yoghurt, while other meat-free options are available too, such as nut butter toast with hazelnut, almond, sunflower seeds, sea salt and honey.\n\nSlake your thirst with a pink lemongrass and chrysanthemum lemonade while taking in the smells of fresh baking wafting from the oven. After brunch, go for a stroll: the colourful shophouses offer a glimpse of Singapore’s past. The district was a residential enclave for Peranakans, the descendants of Chinese or Indian migrants to Singapore who married women from the Malay Archipelago in the 15th century.\n\nThis is the flagship of a chain of bakeries named after the area in which it opened its first branch (not too far from the Central Business District). Tiong Bahru is the oldest housing estate in Singapore, where you’ll find 1930s-style Streamline Moderne architecture that features lines and curves inspired by cars, planes and ships.\n\nThis is a mecca for lovers of baked goods, offering a vast selection: try the small sugar brioche — a bun dusted with sweet crystals — the lemon loaf or the apple crumble. Savoury palates will be satisfied too; I recommend the pulled pork bun, and the more adventurous should opt for a smoked-salmon squid-ink roll. Everything goes well with a double espresso or long black coffee.\n\nOnce a nutmeg plantation, Dempsey Hill became a military camp under British rule and now has a thriving food scene that is popular with expats. SPRMRKT is situated within a former British army barracks, echoing the colonial past of Singapore before it became an independent state in 1965.\n\nThis is one of many dining establishments in the area competing for your attention, and it’s a nice spot to start a day of café-hopping. A chic interior greets you as you walk in; the layout is clean, angular and more spacious than some of the other places on this list. SPRMRKT does a western-style brunch menu, from eggs Benedict (ham or crab) to avocado toast and buttermilk pancakes (these are soft, fluffy and thicker than the thin and floppy ready-made ones normally found in supermarkets here, so they should fill you up). For something more substantial, go for the breakfast platter: eggs, mushrooms, pork sausages, bacon, tomato, greens and toast. Tasty cocktails, wine and craft beer are available too.\n\nThis is one of those places where the atmosphere is more enticing than the menu. Travellers to Singapore commonly enter via Changi Airport. This eatery is next to the lesser-known Seletar Airport, which caters to smaller planes and private jets.\n\nSoek Seng 1954 Bicycle Café (vintage bikes hang on the inside walls) serves a wide range of cuisine: dishes include standard western fare such as burgers and steak, Japanese rice bowls and favourites such as beef rendang. There are certainly better versions of these dishes elsewhere in Singapore, but what you are really here for is the unconventional vibe of brunching right next to an airstrip, where you can watch the occasional small plane take off or try to name the different models of aircraft you spot. The smaller size of the planes means that the kind of noise and pollution usually associated with aviation will not ruin your meal.\n\nSentosa Cove is known as the Monaco of Singapore, an area where the ultra rich live and play with expensive toys such as yachts and supercars on a tourist island linked to the main city-state. (Odds are those who landed with their private jets at Seletar Airport may be headed here.) From your seat in Miska Café, you’ll be able to view the scores of pristine vessels on display at the Sentosa Cove dock while tucking into a Mediterranean-inspired brunch. You can have a hearty breakfast steak with halloumi cheese and pita bread, or the shakshouka — oven-baked eggs with feta, roast stewed tomato, peppers and onion. Take note: if you’re dining on the terrace, don’t leave your table if there’s food on your plate — the local mynahs and crows will dash down for scraps if it is unoccupied. It is not uncommon to see staff rush to clear plates when the birds swoop in.\n\nWhere’s your favourite place for brunch in Singapore?

    "body": "Société Générale made an arrangement with the Singapore government that allowed it to relocate at least a dozen Hong Kong bankers despite the city-state’s tightening of controls on foreign hires, according to people close to the matter.\n\nTwo people familiar with the relocations said they were made this year after the French bank came under pressure from staff in Hong Kong keen to escape the Chinese territory’s tough pandemic restrictions.\n\nUnder the arrangement, SocGen officially designated its Singapore office as the back-up location for its Asia headquarters in Hong Kong, the centre of its regional operations since 1977, said one of the people. The bank was then able to declare a business “emergency” after Hong Kong intensified its pandemic measures and temporarily move workers to ensure “continuity”.\n\nThe workaround, the person said, was an indicator that Singapore did not want to appear “too obstructionist” to foreign workers even as it increased restrictions on them.\n\nSingapore, long seen as one of the world’s most open economies, has faced increasing difficulty balancing the demands of international businesses and locals in recent years. As the city-state seeks to bolster its reputation as a regional financial hub, it has also come under pressure to control immigration amid deepening anti-foreigner sentiment.\n\nThis year, it raised the minimum salary required for foreign professionals to obtain a visa and tightened curbs on the number of expatriates that companies can employ. Although the government said this cap does not apply to skilled professionals, businesses said restrictions were often applied informally.\n\n“Singapore has these quotas . . . [SocGen] will never get them [in on longer-term visas],” said one of the people familiar with the bank’s staff move. But the person added that SocGen realised it would have problems retaining employees if it did not respond to their demands.\n\nSingapore supported the relocations because officials saw the move as an opportunity to attract good finance jobs, another person said.\n\nSocGen is among a number of international financial institutions that have recently moved staff from Hong Kong to Singapore as pandemic restrictions in the Chinese territory disrupt inward and outbound travel. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citibank have all made senior relocations in recent months.\n\nBut some banks said that due to Singapore’s stricter immigration control policies, they have abandoned contingency plans that could have led to larger-scale relocations.\n\n“Singapore doesn’t make sense for us,” said the Asia head of one international bank. “[The government] have been very explicit they don’t want us to move more back-office people. They’re happy for us to have a bigger back-office operation as long as we hire locally.”\n\nThe Asia head added: “There’s no rationale in us closing down operations in Hong Kong and rehiring in Singapore. There’s not enough talent.”\n\nMany businesses plan to keep their Asian headquarters in Hong Kong. According to one person familiar with the matter, SocGen eventually hopes to return staff from Singapore once possible.\n\nSingapore’s Ministry of Manpower said “no special exemptions” had been granted to Société Générale.\n\n“Staying open and connected to the world is fundamental to our success as a vibrant, leading global business hub,” the ministry said.\n\nSocGen declined to comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tabby Kinder in Hong Kong",

    "blurb": "Recent policy moves suggest Lawrence Wong will struggle to strike a balance between the US and China",
    "date": "2022-05-0300:00:00.0",
    "body": "Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first prime minister who built the foundations for the city-state, was different things to different people. Former British foreign secretary George Brown called him the “best bloody Englishman east of Suez”. The Chinese government described Lee upon his death as a “strategist embodying Oriental values”.\n\nSingapore’s next leader will find it harder to be a friend to everyone.\n\nFinance minister Lawrence Wong, 49, was confirmed last month as the successor to Lee Hsien Loong, son of Lee Kuan Yew and the current prime minister. But Wong, who would be only the fourth prime minister in the quasi-authoritarian state’s 56-year history, faces a more difficult task than any of his predecessors in maintaining friendly relations with China and the west.\n\nLee Kuan Yew’s pragmatic vision was to create an international financial powerhouse by building an open economy with close ties to both east and west. Today, Singapore trades more with China than any other country and the US is its biggest foreign investor.\n\nBut recent foreign policy moves have highlighted the increasing challenge of maintaining that balance. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the government condemned and imposed sanctions on Moscow, in a rare break from its cautious approach to diplomacy.\n\nDuring a business conference in March, Wong expressed concern that mounting global tensions would overshadow the city-state.\n\n“Will we, with this event happening, be entering a more divided, a more bifurcated world? Will we start to see . . . an erosion of the international, rules-based order that has enabled small countries like Singapore to thrive and prosper?” he asked.\n\nWong, who as with every prime minister to precede him is ethnically Chinese and western educated, became a member of parliament in 2011 after more than a decade in the civil service.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, he co-chaired the committee that led Singapore’s virus response before becoming finance minister last year.\n\nWong, whose party has yet to reveal when he will take control, has recited Singapore’s economic mantra during his time as finance minister, emphasising that the city-state remained open to businesses and workers from around the world.\n\nWhile acknowledging the increasingly fraught global environment, he has welcomed US plans to build an “economic framework” in the Indo-Pacific, even suggesting China could one day join the pact.\n\n“We have entered a new era of greater contestation for influence between countries and blocks, which may erode the rules-based multilateral system that has been so crucial to Singapore’s success. In particular, rivalry between the two great powers — US and China — has intensified, and will impact the world for the rest of the decade and more,” he said in February.\n\nLinda Lim, a business professor at the University of Michigan who knew Wong when he studied there, described him as a “technocrat” who would maintain the status quo. The problem, she added, is that the “status quo [is] evolving”.\n\n“If we were still in the 1990s or early 2000s, someone like Lawrence Wong would fit right in. How someone like that would fit in now is an unknown,” said Ian Chong, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore who performed his national service with Wong.\n\nWong’s team declined to comment directly on what to expect from his administration. But they pointed to a press conference held following the announcement of his succession, when the finance minister stressed his desire to lead as a team, adding “it is never about one person”.\n\nCo-operating with both sides could also cause Wong trouble at home. About 64 per cent of Singaporeans view China favourably, according to a Pew Research Center study released last year, compared with a median of just 27 per cent in the 17 advanced economies surveyed. Only in Singapore did more people prefer close economic ties with China to with the US.\n\n“We feel a certain sympathy, even empathy, for the Chinese,” said one former independent MP.\n\n“We no longer trust western politicians. We no longer trust the western media,” the person added.\n\nRising inequality has also stoked frustration with the open market economy championed by Wong and western leaders.\n\n“There is a big overlap between those who are more sceptical of that western world order and those who may have not benefited much from globalisation,” said Donald Low, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a former civil servant in Singapore.\n\n“Voters have a voice. Whether that means Singapore cannot find this delicate balance, that remains to be seen.”\n\nWong is unlikely to be seriously challenged in an election: the ruling People’s Action party has won every vote since independence.\n\nMany Singaporeans cling to the hope that the country can remain a friend to all and enemy to none.\n\n“Morally, I support [Singapore’s stance on Ukraine],” said Yeoh Lam Keong, former chief economist at GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund. But “I’m not sure it’s the smart thing to do”, he added.\n\nHe pointed to Switzerland during the second world war, claiming it “may have been invaded and taken over” if it had condemned Nazi Germany. “You have got to think in the best interests of your country . . . For small countries it is not a matter of choice, it is a matter of survival.”",

    "blurb": "In the first of a new FT Globetrotter series on sustainable escapes in and around our destination cities, we sail an hour south of Singapore to a duo of sublime private-island resorts that privilege renewability, the environment and community engagement ",
    "date": "2022-05-0100:00:00.0",
    "body": "This article is part of a guide to Singapore from FT Globetrotter\n\nHere’s a question I’m asked a lot: is there a hotel or resort in the world you love so much, a place that gets it so right, that you’ve kept it to yourself, and never written about it?\n\nThe answer I’m invariably inclined to give anyone who’s not a friend seems obvious, if also churlish: where exactly does dishing about it fit into the “keeping it to myself” agenda? But some places merit extolment far too much to not share them. Nikoi, a private-island resort in the western Indonesian regency of Bintan, is one of them. For that reason I have actually written about it, including for this newspaper — though given it’s been happily humming along at about 90 per cent occupancy year-round for ages, I suspect I’m pretty irrelevant to its success.\n\nThose who know Nikoi know its story: in 2004 Andrew Dixon, an Australian who was then a Singapore-based banker, purchased a deserted 37-acre Indonesian island some 60 miles south of the Lion City with a small cohort of friends, initially with the idea of using it as a weekend escape. Over time, the group realised it made more sense to run it as a resort. Because the project evolved slowly, with no huge revenue-generating agenda, Dixon, who took the lead on development, was able to adhere to a sustainable vision.\n\nThe result is a place that today resembles what it was a decade ago, and still run along the same precepts: high gratification in ways that matter for enjoyment and low-fi in ways that matter for the environment. It has a fine white-sand beach; an interior of unadulterated rainforest; bars and restaurants with sand floors, and a single menu each day; a grass tennis court; a spa consisting of a clutch of dreamy tents next to the water. No phones or TVs in the rooms — just the privileging of the truest and most elemental luxuries there are: space, light, and nature.\n\nThe journey to get to Nikoi starts with a one-hour ferry from Singapore to Bintan island, followed by a one-hour car transfer to its eastern shore, where a speedboat waits at Dixon’s private jetty to take you the remaining 20 minutes. So you commit; but then you’re there, greeted with icy ginger-snake fruit mocktails, walking along packed-sand paths curtained by emerald undergrowth to the villas, strung out along the beach. These are enormous (even the most basic is two storeys) with indoor-outdoor living rooms and a spare bathroom downstairs, and a huge, airy bedroom and bathroom upstairs, fronted by a wide veranda.\n\nThere is no air con, but huge fans spin lazily above, and the breeze from the sea — maybe 10 yards from your private garden and massage bale — sneaks in and out all day long. The main beach is lined with loungers and umbrellas. There are two bars, and two restaurants: the food at the main one is mainly Indonesian with some western dishes; opening in July, the new restaurant by the pool will serve pizzas and Mediterranean dishes.\n\nNikoi hits all its marks on holiday style, but they’re balanced carefully in a framework that prioritises, as it always has, the sustainable footprint. Villas are constructed of driftwood; power comes primarily from solar, and entirely from renewable energy sources. Desalination technology produces potable water, and groundwater is recycled for all other purposes, including tending the organic gardens (the island also sources from fisherman and farmers on Bintan). External consultants visit regularly to survey the natural and marine environments, ensuring best practices for protection — and restoration — are in place. If it all sounds par for the course to 2022 ears, bear in mind Dixon was already doing this in 2007, back when bath butlers and $82 Kobe burgers in the Maldives were the vanguard of Experiential Luxury.\n\nA decade after purchasing Nikoi, Dixon acquired a second island about 14 miles to the south called Cempedak. It opened in 2017 as a more ambitiously sleek destination, and a child-free one — a boon for those who, as a repeat visitor and friend of Dixon’s I know once noted, find that Nikoi (which is hugely popular with Singapore-based families) can skew a bit Lord of the Flies on weekends.\n\nCempedak’s sustainability bona fides are no less legitimate. With driftwood no longer in ample supply, its villas were instead built with bamboo, one of the world’s most renewable materials. Their innovative architecture maximises air circulation, eliminating the need for air conditioning. They’re also massive, leveraging bamboo’s famous tensile strength in soaring, dome-like configurations.\n\nSo far, so eco-fabulous. But genuine sustainability extends beyond environmental custodianship to engagement with local communities. Dixon had done so in an ad hoc, intuitive capacity from the time of Nikoi’s inception, both with Riau Islands Indonesians and with the local seafaring nomadic ethnic groups, known collectively as Orang Suku Laut. In 2010 he made it official, registering a non-profit, The Island Foundation, in Singapore. It quickly became evident that education initiatives would have the biggest impact. “It was also what the communities themselves wanted most from us,” he tells me. “A lot of these kids are excluded from learning because of the language and economic barriers they face.”\n\nAround 90 per cent of the people The Island Foundation serves are in fishing communities, which aren’t always counted in the national literacy data; the non-profit estimates that as many as 30 per cent of adults haven’t completed primary education themselves. And in the case of the Orang Laut, Dixon says, “they’re now some of the first generations to live on land. They can be culturally marginalised and viewed superstitiously by locals,” which tends to further distance them from educational opportunities.\n\nToday the Foundation runs eight learning centres in rural Bintan communities, educating as many as 250 primary-school-aged children at a time. Stakeholders are engaged too: teacher-training courses are free to local adults; Learning for Sustainability, an education programme for the children taught by the Foundation, was recently introduced. Meanwhile, Island Foundation staff and volunteers provide support in human resources, infrastructure and data-gathering.\n\nLike the rest of the travel industry, Dixon suffered a huge blow with the onset of the pandemic. The Singapore-Indonesia border stayed closed more or less consistently from early 2020 until April 2022. But he managed to keep his resorts’ staff engaged, and solvent, by partnering with an Asia-based profit-for-purpose organisation called Seven Clean Seas (SCS), which sells plastic credits to companies as offsets, ploughing the returns into clean-up initiatives across the region.\n\nBefore Covid, Dixon says, his employees had done “maybe a couple of beach cleans a year”. Since 2020, they have helped remove 250 tonnes of plastic from Bintan beaches and audited it for recycling. “We initially had two teams, each working twice a week; SCS funded one team, we funded the other,” he explains. They eventually worked five times weekly or more, collecting as many as 1.5 tonnes of plastic each go. “They were paid a full-day’s wage for a half-day’s work, plus a bonus,” Dixon says. The rates were the going minimum wage, which, he notes, was less than his staff normally earn, “but they didn’t really have other sources of income, so it’s been a real lifeline”.\n\nMeanwhile, borders are open again and guests are returning in numbers. Three new villas have been completed on Nikoi, and major upkeep projects ticked off (“It was a fantastic time to re-roof,” Dixon says with a laugh). These days, he’s focused on implementing an official management plan for the Marine Protected Area in which Nikoi and Cempedak sit, in collaboration with other foundations and government actors. He speaks enthusiastically of eight previously unidentified species of fish, and more than 200 others that are new to the area, discovered on sponsored dive surveys.\n\nIt’s that engagement, and walking the talk, that makes Nikoi the backable venture it is. But not only. The place, it must be said again, is the dream. Go one day, if you can. Not that you heard it from me.\n\nNikoi, minimum three-night stay in a one-bedroom beach house from S$1,335 (about £765). Cempedak, minimum three-night stay in a pool villa from S$1,425 (about £815)\n\nDo you have any green getaways to recommend in and around Singapore?

    "date": "2022-04-2600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s decision to execute a Malaysian man with a learning disability for drug trafficking has highlighted the regressive laws in one of the world’s most liberal economies, critics say.\n\nActivists and the UN have made a last-minute appeal to spare the life of Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, who supporters said has an IQ of 69, and Datchinamurthy Kataiah. Both were convicted of separate drug trafficking offences.\n\nUp to 300 campaigners staged a demonstration on Monday in Speakers’ Corner, a fenced-off area in Singapore designated for protests, to oppose the executions.\n\nOn the same day, the UN urged Singapore to halt the executions and raised concerns that the city-state was lining up a string of capital punishments after a temporary reprieve during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe case of Dharmalingam in particular has drawn criticism from world leaders and rights groups, who have argued that the 34-year-old’s sentence should be commuted because of his learning disability.\n\nSingapore’s embrace of globalisation has helped it prosper and forge close ties with the world’s leading economies. But the city-state, once infamously described as “Disneyland with the death penalty”, has maintained strict laws that set it apart from many of its trading partners.\n\nForeigners without permanent residence in Singapore are prohibited from attending protests at Speakers’ Corner. This meant family members had to watch from the sidelines as campaigners spoke in support of the Malaysian men, whom activists said were scheduled to be executed this week following their arrests more than a decade ago.\n\n“In lifestyle, in everything, Singapore is considered a very good country,” said Kataiah’s sister, Sathirani, from outside the fence. But the death penalty “is a black dot on Singapore”.\n\nThe law ministry declined to comment, but has maintained that executions are a necessary deterrent supported by the majority of citizens. A survey of 1,500 Singaporeans by the National University of Singapore found that 87 per cent supported the death penalty for drug trafficking.\n\nBut when a range of scenarios involving drug offences were described in detail to respondents, that support dropped to less than half.\n\nLast year, an EU delegation to Singapore called for Dharmalingam’s death sentence to be commuted, adding there was no compelling evidence that capital punishment was more effective than imprisonment.\n\nA cross-party group of UK MPs has also asked foreign secretary Liz Truss, who has called for the country to emulate Singapore’s economic model, to defend Dharmalingam, according to The Times.\n\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: “It is the longstanding policy of the UK government to oppose the death penalty. The UK government has raised concerns with the government of Singapore about the resumption of executions, including the case of Mr Nagaenthran.”\n\nHuman rights lawyer M Ravi wrote in a Facebook post that Dharmalingam’s mother had filed a last-ditch challenge in the Court of Appeal. He added she would appear in court on Tuesday as she could not find a lawyer in Singapore to represent her son.\n\n“[Nagaenthran] has suffered”, said Dharmalingam’s brother, Navin. We still “hope he can stave off execution”.",

    "body": "Singapore’s finance minister Lawrence Wong has been made prime ministerial heir apparent, as the ruling People’s Action party seeks to recover public support and bolster the city-state’s status as an international financial hub.\n\nLee Hsien Loong, prime minister since 2004, announced on social media late on Thursday that ministers had backed Wong to be the leader of the ruling PAP’s “fourth generation team” with “overwhelming support”.\n\nThe fourth generation team is a group of younger ministers lined up to take the reins of the governing party, putting its leader on course to be the next prime minister.\n\n“This decision on succession is a crucial one for Singapore,” Lee said. “It will ensure the continuity and stability of leadership that are the hallmarks of our system.”\n\nWong, 49, would be only the fourth leader of the quasi-authoritarian state in its 56-year history. The announcement comes as the PAP, which has governed since independence and transformed Singapore into an international business centre, faces pressure to control immigration and navigate an increasingly divided geopolitical environment.\n\nThe PAP’s succession plans were thrown into disarray last year, after deputy prime minister Heng Swee Keat stepped down as leader of the fourth generation team.\n\nAlongside health minister Ong Ye Kung and education minister Chan Chun Sing, Wong was considered one of the favourites to succeed Lee, who is a son of founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.\n\n“The right to lead is not inherited. It has to be earned afresh by each generation of leaders,” Lee said in a posting on Facebook.\n\nLinda Lim, a business professor at the University of Michigan who knew Wong when he studied economics there, said he was a “safe decision” that would help the party maintain the status quo.\n\n“Lawrence has always been more of a technocrat than a politician,” she said. “There is not going to be a huge amount of change.”\n\nBut Lim added that the “status quo was evolving” for Singapore.\n\nIn recent years, the PAP has struggled to maintain Singapore’s openness to international business. In the 2020 general election, the party lost a record amount of seats to the opposition after a recession triggered by the pandemic deepened frustrations about inequality and competition with foreign workers.\n\nIncreasing tensions between China and the US have also raised questions about whether Singapore can retain close ties with both. Following the invasion of Ukraine, ministers made a rare break from tradition and condemned Russia while calling on Beijing to assert its influence on Moscow.\n\nAt a speech to Singapore business leaders last month, Wong signalled his desire to counter pushback against the PAP and increase Singapore’s strength as a financial centre.\n\n“Strong connectivity will enable us to be a choice destination for business, finance, trade and even data flows,” he said.\n\n“But all the connections that we have . . . will not be sufficient if we are not connected in our hearts and minds. That’s why it’s also very, very important that we always retain the ethos and mindset in Singapore. To stay open, to welcome entrepreneurs, talent and investment from around the world.”",

    "body": "South Korea and Singapore have become the latest Asian economies to tighten monetary policy to combat inflationary risks stoked by the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Bank of Korea on Thursday increased its benchmark interest rate for the fourth time since August to 1.5 per cent, its highest level in almost three years. The central bank made the decision as inflation in Asia’s fourth-largest economy hit 4.1 per cent in March on a year earlier, more than double the BoK’s target range and up from 3.7 per cent in February.\n\nSeparately, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which relies on exchange rate adjustments rather than interest rates to guide monetary policy, said it would raise the midpoint for the Singapore dollar’s trading band and increase the pace at which it allowed the currency to move for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nThe city-state keeps the trading band and the composition of the currency basket on which it is based secret to deter speculation, but the Singapore dollar was up 0.7 per cent against its US counterpart at about $0.74 following the MAS announcement on Thursday.\n\nThe MAS announced the move as core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport, hit 2.3 per cent year on year in January-February, up from 1.7 per cent in the final three months of last year.\n\nSingapore also upgraded its core inflation forecast for the year by 0.5 percentage points to 2.5-3.5 per cent and its all-items forecast by 2 percentage points to between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent. Economists also highlighted downside risks to the city-state’s gross domestic product growth, which came in at 3.4 per cent for the first three months of 2022, just missing forecasts.\n\nThe Korean and Singaporean decisions were announced a day after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand increased rates by half a percentage point, its biggest rise in 22 years.\n\nNew Zealand’s most recent inflation figure, from December 2021, was 5.9 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent a year earlier. The country’s central bank expects inflation to peak at 7 per cent in the first half of 2022.\n\nSouth Korea and Singapore cited surging costs owing to the war in Ukraine on top of the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnalysts at Fitch, the rating agency, said rising commodity prices would continue to push up inflation across Asia and probably lead to further rate increases.\n\n“Inflation in Asian [emerging markets] . . . has generally been more subdued than in much of the rest of the world,” they wrote in a note. “Policy tightening may now be brought forward, especially if commodity-price moves were to speed up Fed tightening.”\n\nCapital Economics, the consultancy, projected the BoK would deliver at least two more 25-basis point increases this year, which would take the country’s benchmark rate to its highest level since early 2015.\n\nBut Clara Cheong, a Singapore-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said Asian economies varied widely and inflation in the region had been more subdued than elsewhere.\n\n“Generally what we’ve seen is that inflation has been relatively more benign in this part of the world due to the delayed recovery from the pandemic,” she said, adding that China would probably ease monetary policy to be able to achieve its 5.5 per cent annual growth target.\n\nThe moves by South Korea and Singapore were “unlikely to signal a wave of Asian central bank hawkishness”, she added.",

    "date": "2022-04-1400:00:00.0",
    "body": "CLSA, an institutional broker and investment group, has proposed moving its flagship investors’ forum from Hong Kong to Singapore this year as pandemic restrictions in the territory disrupt international travel, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nThey said the brokerage had suggested to its Chinese owner Citic Securities the relocation of what is Hong Kong’s best-known business conference. The star-studded annual event has run for almost three decades with attendees including representatives from the world’s biggest funds and celebrity guests such as Bill Clinton, Desmond Tutu and Kylie Minogue.\n\nCLSA’s proposal to move the event, typically attended by 1,500 institutional investors from around the world, highlights the disruption caused by Hong Kong’s strict pandemic control measures.\n\nIt also comes as some international companies have relocated teams of staff to Singapore, which is seeking to bolster its reputation as a financial hub in Asia.\n\nPlans to move the forum have been stalled because it would require sign-off from the chair of Citic Securities, CLSA’s parent company and the largest state-owned investment bank in China, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nCitic Securities chair Zhang Youjun has not given the green light to the relocation because of logistical and political challenges, according to one of the people.\n\nRelocating the conference “makes commercial sense”, the person said, “but it’s in Beijing’s hands. It is not a straightforward political decision”.\n\nCLSA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nCLSA was founded in 1986 by journalists in Hong Kong. It was acquired by Citic Securities for $1.2bn in 2013, the first time a Chinese brokerage acquired a global financial institution. The deal was part of a push by China to create a global investment banking powerhouse, but has suffered a series of senior exits.\n\nThe CLSA annual party has been considered one of the best launch pads for international investors to form relationships with fast-growing Chinese companies and access opportunities in Asia. This year’s conference — the 29th — was scheduled to be held at the Rosewood Hong Kong in September.\n\nCLSA’s Tokyo forum will be held online for the third year in a row next month and its Asean conference was held virtually in March. However, some company executives had pushed for the flagship event in Hong Kong to go ahead in order to compete with other conferences in Europe and the US that have returned this year, said one of the people familiar with the discussions.\n\nRelocating the conference comes with its own challenges, including whether it would be possible for executives from Chinese corporations to travel to Singapore and back because of China’s own zero-Covid restrictions.\n\n“How do you structure an event when China is on hold?” said one of the people familiar with the matter. “It is getting more difficult for Chinese companies to connect with foreign clients. The exchange of information and ideas is at a standstill.”\n\nThe Asia head of a global hedge fund in Hong Kong said he thought the financial services industry would benefit from the conference happening in person.\n\n“I know that it’s not straightforward, but I really hope they do go ahead in Singapore,” the person said. “The whole industry is just waiting for someone to break the deadlock . . . it doesn’t matter if it’s not in Hong Kong.”",

    "date": "2022-04-1000:00:00.0",
    "body": "This article is part of a guide to Singapore from FT Globetrotter\n\nI usually travel a lot for work and play, but throughout the pandemic I, like everyone, have spent a whole lot more time in one place — here in Singapore, one of my favourite cities.\n\nWhenever I am here, I start my day with a morning run: the route I like the most is around MacRitchie Reservoir Park, Singapore’s largest reservoir. It feels like a different world, away from the skyscrapers and surrounded by tropical rainforest, yet still close to the city centre. It’s an invigorating dose of nature amid urban life; non-runners can go kayaking and canoeing here too.\n\nAfter a run, for my morning coffee I like Tiong Bahru Bakery — they make a great brew and serve excellent French pastries and cakes in the trendy Tiong Bahru neighbourhood. The area has some interesting architecture to take in, inspired by the 1930s Streamline Moderne style, with its clean lines and curved forms. For something more authentically Singaporean, I head to Killiney Kopitiam — an old, very local and pretty rustic experience, where the coffee is served to take away in plastic bags. The Killiney Road branch has been there since 1919 and is a local institution. Nearby is Journey East, a cool furniture store that I might pop into to check out its diverse offering of decor and design pieces, some made from reclaimed teak, others Asian vintage, industrial chic or by boutique designers.\n\nI typically prefer to travel around town in a taxi — Singapore is surprisingly walkable, but it’s usually much too hot and humid to go very far on foot. I’ll head over to the National Gallery Singapore. The building is an architectural beauty, and home to both the world’s largest public display of modern south-east Asian art and to Odette, the three-Michelin-starred French restaurant from chef Julien Royer. The decor, by Sacha Leong of Universal Design Studio and artist Dawn Ng, is an elegant, pastel creation, as delicate as the food. I might stop for a special lunch after exploring the galleries, or fit in some shopping first. I love Space, a designer-furniture destination on Bencoolen Street, not far from the gallery.\n\nFor independent stores and craft boutiques, I’ll stroll around the creative hub of Arab Street, named in reference to the area’s rich Islamic history and culture. Textile merchants with their brightly coloured fabrics, Middle Eastern restaurants and vegan cafés abound, and the charming, colourful “shophouses” are one of our most popular forms of local architecture.\n\nKeong Saik Road is another favourite neighbourhood for vintage finds, as well as cool restaurants and bars. In the 1960s it was Singapore’s red-light district. Today, its heritage buildings combine with street art, co-working spaces and hip hang-outs such as Pasta Bar, Potato Head and Papa Doble.\n\nSingapore is a cosmopolitan place where different cultures coexist side by side and often merge. Nowhere is that more evident than the temples you’ll see everywhere — Indian, Buddhist, Taoist — and Christian churches. As a hotelier, I am constantly looking for design inspiration and I am very influenced by the bright colours of some of our temples here, so I’ll often visit them. There’s the Hindu Sri Thendayuthapani Temple and the Taoist Tan Si Chong Su, which are both visually stimulating, no matter what your beliefs. Our three new hotels in New Zealand embrace the joyful and uplifting use of colour you’ll see here.\n\nFor a late lunch, dim sum at Min Jiang is always a winner, or if you want to partake in the latest culinary craze in Singapore — hot pot — head to a branch of Hai Di Lao. Be warned, it’s very popular and there’s often an hour-long wait, but it’s worth it.\n\nChilled afternoons are spent at PS Café in Dempsey Hill, a sweet spot for a cup of tea and a quiet corner to read. It’s surrounded by a park and makes the most of its setting in nature with expansive wraparound floor-to-ceiling windows. I love the contrast between the urban and the natural in  Singapore.\n\nFor an early-evening stroll, head to Marina Bay — down by the water you can enjoy the breeze and take in the incredible architecture: on one side, the original skyscrapers of Singapore, and on the other, the iconic Marina Bay Sands resort, which completely changed the city’s skyline when it opened in 2010.\n\nFor dinner there’s a plethora of choices — my favourites include Rang Mahal at Pan Pacific Singapore for exquisite Indian food in a contemporary setting and, for Chinese food in a heritage building, Madame Fan by Alan Yau and chef Mike Tan.\n\nMuch of our nightlife is closed due to the pandemic, but usually for late-night drinks I would suggest Spago at the top of Marina Bay Sands. It’s a lovely spot for alfresco cocktails, with breathtaking views of the city from one of its highest points. Atlas is another favourite watering hole for its dramatic Art Deco design. The building, by the late property magnate CS Hwang, was modelled after western-style Art Deco hotels and is sometimes referred to as Gotham — visit and you’ll see why. Named one of the World’s Best Bars last year, it serves a gin and tonic as perfectly constructed as the surroundings. It’s ideal way to end the day.\n\nGaurang Jhunjhnuwala is the CEO of Naumi Hotels\n\nHow would you spend your perfect day in Singapore?

    "date": "2022-04-0600:00:00.0",
    "body": "Ser Lin Chia, a Singaporean entrepreneur, has a simple message for expats: go somewhere else.\n\nAs Singapore eases its pandemic measures, it has become the obvious destination for many Hong Kongers worn down by years of travel restrictions, home-schooling and lengthy quarantines.\n\nMultinationals from JPMorgan to Bank of America have considered moving staff from Hong Kong to Singapore as the Chinese city’s dogged pursuit of zero-Covid stymies business.\n\nBut Chia, who said competition with foreigners for jobs forced him to launch his own business five years ago, thinks corporations have a responsibility to create employment for locals.\n\n“If companies want to set up their operation in Singapore to take advantage of the safety, the political environment, they have to hire Singaporeans,” he said. “[Expats in Hong Kong] have to make do with their circumstances. If they cannot, they have to go back to where they came from.”\n\nThat view is at odds with Singapore’s reputation as one of the world’s most open and reliable places to do business. Since independence in 1965, the tiny city-state’s economy has thrived largely thanks to its low tax rates and willingness to accept international businesses and workers.\n\nFrom Google to Twitter, many of the world’s largest companies have their Asian headquarters in Singapore, where about two in every five workers were foreigners in 2019.\n\nBut Chia is not alone in holding anti-expat beliefs. Over the past decade, perceptions that international employers have discriminated against locals have placed increasing pressure on the government to clamp down on immigration.\n\nWhile some anger has been directed towards manual labourers from elsewhere in Asia, Singaporeans are also frustrated by the significant proportion of westerners that make up the city’s elite workforce.\n\nAfter the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic refocused attention on employment and inequality in Singapore, the discontent has intensified. Experts warned that an influx of white-collar staff from Hong Kong risked deepening tensions, complicating Singapore’s bid to attract foreign money and talent.\n\n“It will certainly expose these issues,” said Fraser Howie, an independent analyst who lived in Singapore for several years. “We are talking finance, we are talking high-paying jobs . . . [Singaporeans] will say: hang on, these jobs are being brought here, so why aren’t they being offered to Singaporeans first?”\n\nHong Kong suffered a net outflow of 129,000 people in February and March, but an influx of professionals from the rival financial hub is unlikely to have a significant effect on the overall number of foreigners in Singapore. Most non-residents are manual or domestic workers from countries such as Malaysia and India.\n\nAs of December, the number of employment-pass holders in Singapore had fallen by almost a fifth compared with pre-pandemic levels, as fed-up expats fled the island’s tough Covid restrictions before they were eased towards the end of 2021.\n\nLinda Lim, a business professor from Singapore who works at the University of Michigan, said that “objectively, [the arrivals from Hong Kong will] not change anything [but] a lot depends on how these [expats] carry themselves”.\n\nShe pointed to cases of westerners refusing to wear masks that were reported in the local press and shared across social media in the early days of the pandemic, igniting public anger.\n\nLim said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has further divided the west and China, had “unleashed all these simmering tensions” in majority Chinese Singapore. Many Singaporeans she knew were consuming anti-western “Chinese propaganda” and sharing it on WhatsApp.\n\nSome view the Singapore government, which has aligned itself with the west in condemning Russia, as “lapdogs of imperialists, just serving western or international companies”.\n\nThe government faces a difficult balancing act placating disgruntled voters while presenting an open image to the world. Although the People’s Action party has ruled since independence, in the 2020 election it lost a record number of seats to the opposition Workers’ party, which had called for tighter controls on employment visas.\n\nWary of antagonising China, ministers avoid referring directly to the city’s rivalry with Hong Kong. But this year they have repeatedly emphasised the importance of bringing in talent while steadily opening Singapore’s borders.\n\nAttending the opening of Dyson’s new global headquarters in Singapore last month, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong urged Singaporeans to remember that “the ethos of our society must remain open . . . If we succumb to the temptation to close our doors, we will surely end up hurting ourselves”.\n\nThe Singapore government has introduced further measures that will make it more difficult for companies to hire from abroad. This year it announced new minimum salaries and a “points-based” system for approving employment passes, Singapore’s visa for higher-earning professionals.\n\nThe rules, which from September will require incoming finance professionals to earn at least S$5,500 ($4,050) a month, will probably not trouble Hong Kong’s bankers. Animosity towards expats, rarely expressed by Singaporeans in public, is also unlikely to deter those desperate to escape Hong Kong.\n\nBut outside Singapore’s central business district there are many who will not welcome the latest arrivals and want the government to take harsher action.\n\nEric Tan, a retired banker in Singapore, said any companies relocating teams from Hong Kong should consider replacing expat staff with Singaporeans within two years.\n\n“We go into the workplace and find we are a minority,” said Tan, a former HSBC employee. “The indigenous Singaporeans, the core Singaporeans, must benefit because this is their country. We must look after the core group.”\n\nThis article has been amended to reflect the fact that Eric Tan did not work at Citi and that Linda Lim is a business professor.",

    "body": "Singapore’s leading property website expects to cash in on an influx of house-hunters from Hong Kong, as expatriates fleeing the Chinese city’s strict Covid measures race to secure prime residences in its rival financial centre.\n\nThe chief executive of PropertyGuru, which in March completed a New York listing backed by billionaires Peter Thiel and Richard Li, said the Hong Kong exodus was driving up prices in Singapore’s most in-demand neighbourhoods.\n\n“In pockets, it’s a high-demand, low-supply market, for sure. If you wanted a [house] along [central area] Bukit Timah near the British school, you’re screwed,” chief executive Hari Krishnan said in an interview.\n\nHigher prime Singapore house prices could brighten the outlook for PropertyGuru, which has suffered a nearly one-fifth fall in its share price since listing via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.\n\nThe company charges estate agents higher fees to list more expensive properties, so stands to benefit as prices rise.\n\nBut Krishnan said the new demand was concentrated in certain neighbourhoods, with areas not favoured by expats unlikely to see similar growth. Home price growth across the city slowed to just 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of this year, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority, after the government introduced measures including higher property taxes to cool the market.\n\n“There is real estate available. You can get it at an affordable price,” said Krishnan. “If you choose to live in specific enclaves that are all Aussie, all Brit, all Indian, whatever, that’s your choice. Those are oversubscribed.”\n\nSince Singapore began to loosen Covid-19 restrictions in October, it has received a wave of white-collar workers seeking to escape the quarantines and other measures associated with Hong Kong’s continued pursuit of zero Covid.\n\nOverseas investors are also returning to the Singapore property market, which has long been one of the most popular places for foreigners to park their money. Krishnan said PropertyGuru was making plans to expand beyond the consumer market and to sell its data to institutional investors.\n\n“Singapore is a property-mad country. There’s more money in real estate than in the stock market,” he said, adding that foreign investors were attracted by the stability of the city-state’s politics, economy and legal system.\n\nKrishnan was speaking a week after his company raised about $254mn through its New York debut on March 18, following a merger with the special purpose acquisition company Bridgetown 2, backed by Thiel and Li.\n\nPropertyGuru, which aborted plans to list in Australia in 2019, followed through with the New York listing despite a global decline in technology stocks and mounting regulatory scrutiny of Spac listings.\n\nDespite PropertyGuru’s share price fall since listing, Krishnan said backing from Thiel and Li gave the company “phenomenal access to sophisticated investors in North America and north Asia”.\n\n“The company is much stronger than it was in 2019,” he added. “We successfully listed the business on the largest stock exchange in the world, so we take that as a successful endorsement.”",

    "body": "Expatriates fleeing Hong Kong’s draconian pandemic restrictions are struggling to secure places for their children at Singapore’s top private schools, prompting some families to think twice about relocating to the rival financial centre.\n\nInternational schools across Singapore told the Financial Times that they had received multiple times more inquiries than normal but were unable to meet the unprecedented demand.\n\nMany international businesses are making plans to move staff from Hong Kong, where schools were closed again in January as the territory tightened restrictions. Companies including JPMorgan and Bank of America have considered relocations as border closures and tough quarantine measures make travelling from the city to meet clients almost impossible.\n\nBut growing waiting lists at Singapore’s schools are complicating those plans.\n\n“It is very, very tough. The market is incredibly hot,” said Daniel Beatty, Asia general manager for nutrition group Glanbia, who relocated from Hong Kong in September and is trying to secure a secondary school place for his son.\n\n“Families are saying: ‘Right, if we cannot get kids into places in Singapore . . . we’re planning to go to the UK or Australia.’”\n\nSingapore-based Tanglin Trust School, a non-profit with 2,800 students and annual fees of up to S$46,965 (US$34,600), received as many applications in January and February as during the whole of last year, according to Craig Considine, the chief executive.\n\nFor every one place at the junior school there were about 15 families interested, he said.\n\n“Gaining a place in a good school is a big driver” for those considering whether to relocate, said Considine, adding parents may move somewhere elsewhere if they could not get their child into the right school.\n\nThe Canadian International School, which has about 3,200 pupils across two Singapore campuses and charges fees of up to S$41,700 a year, has already received about seven times more inquiries in 2022 than in the previous six months, according to head of communications Michelle Sharp. As many as 10 families are after every one place in the most oversubscribed year groups.\n\nThe Perse School Singapore is receiving as many as 30 inquiries a day, said Benyna Richards, the principal. But she said there was no waiting list after many expats left the city-state last year before it loosened its Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nClassrooms in Hong Kong, however, are quickly emptying, with rising demand in Singapore mirrored by the falling value of Hong Kong school debentures, a type of advance loan paid for priority admission.\n\nDebentures for Harrow Hong Kong dropped to about HK$3.3mn (US$420,000) this year on the secondary market from a peak of more than HK$5mn in 2019, according to brokerage agencies.\n\nInternational schools in Hong Kong have also reported higher staff turnover this year amid the city’s tough Covid-19 regime. While the government’s decision this week to reintroduce face-to-face schooling in April might ease some pressure on expatriates to leave the city, the territory remains committed to zero Covid.\n\nFor Hong Kong expats unable to sell their debentures to another family, the move to Singapore could be costly.\n\nOne Hong Kong expat who did not want to be named said they would be HK$150,000 worse off when they relocated to Singapore as they did not give enough notice to reclaim their debenture for the rest of the school year.\n\n“It is a costly exercise. It is not for fun,” the person said. But “we just can’t deal with any more home schooling. I work in finance, I don’t have the time to help sit and mentor [my children].”",

    "body": "Hong Kong stock exchange has seized market share from its Singapore rival in China stock futures, opening up a winner-takes-all battle for control of how global investors hedge Chinese equities.\n\nThe fight to become the dominant pool of liquidity for so-called A-share futures not only pits Hong Kong’s share market against Singapore but also Blackrock against Chinese fund companies and the index provider FTSE Russell against MSCI, with implications for their global competitiveness.\n\nOpen interest in Hong Kong’s A-shares futures contract has risen to as much as $2bn since its October launch. The swift uptake recalls past shifts in derivative liquidity, such as the “Battle of the Bund” between Frankfurt and London in the late 1990s.\n\nA-shares are stocks of mainland Chinese companies listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen that trade in renminbi, in contrast to H-shares, which are listed in Hong Kong and trade in freely convertible Hong Kong dollars.\n\nBlackRock, the world’s largest provider of exchange traded funds, has built up a large pool of assets tracking the FTSE China A50, the index underlying the Singapore contract. But three mainland Chinese fund companies have already amassed $10bn in assets to track the new MSCI China A50 Connect index used by Hong Kong.\n\n“I do think the centre of gravity is shifting,” said the head of execution for Asia at one Wall Street investment bank, arguing that the next six months would be crucial in the fight for the futures market. “Liquidity is king with respect to derivative instruments and hedging.”\n\nDespite Hong Kong’s recent inroads, Singapore remains the biggest centre for hedging Chinese equities. Open interest in Singapore futures stands at about $13bn and liquidity has not dropped since Hong Kong’s launch, according to data from Refinitiv.\n\nBut traders said Hong Kong’s success in establishing some initial liquidity suggested the city posed a meaningful threat. HKEX has also waived its trading fee on the new futures until June. Kevin Rideout, co-head of sales and marketing at HKEX, said the exchange could extend the waiver for another six months without regulatory approval.\n\nThere is relentless appetite for exposure to China’s $14tn stock market. Offshore futures have become a central tool for risk management, index tracking funds and structured products after Beijing severely curtailed onshore stock futures trading in 2015.\n\n“When more investors are holding Chinese assets, they need hedging,” said Eddie Yue, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at a recent Financial Times event. “Hong Kong is the best place for risk management to take place. So we are looking at the range of derivative products we have here for that purpose.”\n\nStrategists and traders said the differences between the indices would be one of the main factors in determining the futures contracts winner.\n\nThe FTSE product uses a more straightforward methodology, but the MSCI rival promises better representation of the overall A-share market.\n\nThe FTSE index, which consists of China’s 50 largest companies weighted by market capitalisation, is dominated by the finance and consumer sectors, with names including China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance as well as Kweichow Moutai, the maker of spirit baijiu.\n\nThe MSCI index also includes just 50 companies but is meant to be more representative of the wider market. “This index selects at least two stock names from all sectors,” said Kazuya Nagasawa, the head of MSCI in Asia. “It’s not just the biggest names, which leads to sector bias.”\n\nFor example, Kweichow Moutai makes up 12.7 per cent of the FTSE Russell index, but 8.3 per cent of the MSCI version and less than 6 per cent of China’s benchmark CSI 300 index.\n\nIf investors have the whole A-share market as their universe, then the more representative index would better hedge their exposure, said Jason Lui, head of East Asia strategy at BNP Paribas.\n\nFTSE Russell is considering changes to its index, chief executive Arne Staal told the FT in November, such as weighting by sector and doubling the number of constituent stocks. BNP estimated that those moves could bring the FTSE benchmark’s performance in line with MSCI’s, potentially erasing an advantage for Hong Kong.\n\nMichael Syn, head of equities at SGX, said no decision had been made on expanding the FTSE index or corresponding futures contract, but that “the direction of travel over time is more representation, more inclusion”.\n\nThe Singapore exchange and FTSE also have to be careful of offending Chinese regulators because abrupt changes to the futures contract could blow back into the onshore markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The Hong Kong stock exchange spent more than two years waiting for regulatory approval from Beijing after first announcing plans to launch MSCI-based futures in 2019.\n\nThe history of such battles for liquidity suggests one contract will prevail. In the “Battle for the Bund”, Frankfurt struggled to capture even a third of the market until gains began accelerating in 1997, sapping the London trade dry within a year. As demand for Chinese equities booms, Singapore will hope history does not recur.",

    "body": "You need money to make money. Singaporean banks plan to use their excess billions to find more billionaire clients. Leader DBS’s fourth-quarter profits beat expectations, but it has bigger ambitions. It seeks to expand in Asia’s lucrative wealth management market.\n\nNet income rose to S$1.4bn ($1bn), up 37 per cent. Full year loan growth increased almost a tenth. Wealth management growth meant fee income rose 15 per cent. Non-performing exposure fell and its CET1 ratio finished the year well above its own and regulatory targets at 14.4 per cent.\n\nThat suggests DBS has excess capital of roughly $3.3bn to spend. Buying Citigroup’s consumer banking businesses in Taiwan last month should make DBS the largest foreign bank there. It has already bought access to China last year, gaining approval to become the largest shareholder of Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank Corporation with a 13 per cent stake. Local rivals are keen too. United Overseas Bank will acquire Citi’s south-east Asian retail banking assets.\n\nThe timing is good. Over the past two years, Asia-Pacific has become home to more billionaires than any other region. Taiwan has as many billionaires as Japan. No surprise that wealth management offers very promising opportunities for banks focused on Asia. Singapore’s capital-rich banks can now buy the coveted market share that HSBC and Standard Chartered have also sought for years.\n\nMarkets have taken note. DBS trades at 1.8 times tangible book value, a big 80 per cent premium to Asia-focused peers such as HSBC.\n\nBut acquisitions will not eat into dividends, with the annualised payout to DBS shareholders rising by about a tenth. DBS shares have climbed more than 40 per cent in the past year, and well above 2020 lows. Back then, Singapore’s banks had exposure to energy trader losses plus a credit crunch.\n\nToday, the health of the city-state has improved. Its economy grew 7.2 per cent last year, the fastest rate in more than a decade. But rather than simply chasing loan growth, seeking more fees from billionaire clients should justify DBS’s hefty valuation.",

    "body": "Bank of America, the second-largest US bank by assets, has started a review of its Hong Kong business to identify workers who can be relocated to Singapore as severe pandemic control measures have forced global businesses to re-evaluate their operations in the Chinese territory.\n\nThe bank’s management is considering roles in a number of its business lines and operations, according to a person close to the bank. “It is [in the] early stages of figuring out who might want to go . . . but the process has started,” the person added.\n\nA second person close to the bank described the process as “contingency planning” and said the moves could be permanent or temporary while Covid-19 restrictions on travel persist.\n\nIt is not yet known how many people will be relocated and a wholesale move of any business or operation is unlikely. Bank of America declined to comment.\n\nThe review is being co-ordinated by Richard Yacenda, the bank’s chief operating officer for Asia-Pacific, according to the people. It will also consider the tax and regulatory issues related to relocating some job roles.\n\nHong Kong’s strict coronavirus regime, which involves 21 days of quarantine for international arrivals, has made it ever more difficult for executives to use the city as a regional hub. Passenger flights to eight countries, including the UK and US, have been banned and air freight services reduced.\n\nThe Omicron outbreak has increased pressure on the territory’s zero-Covid strategy, with Hong Kong tightening pandemic controls this month. International business groups have expressed concern that the city has not articulated an exit strategy and is becoming cut off from the world, leading to an exodus of talent and problems for global businesses that recruit overseas.\n\nIn October, global banks warned the Hong Kong government that the territory’s status as an international financial centre was at risk because of “highly restrictive” coronavirus policies that stifle foreign travel.\n\nWells Fargo, America’s fourth-largest bank by assets, was last year quietly working on a plan to move its Asian regional hub from Hong Kong to Singapore as part of wider restructuring efforts.\n\nBonus season, which runs until April at global banks, has heightened anxiety over exits among both foreign and local workers who have been unable to travel freely for two years.\n\nAfter reporting record profits in 2021, Bank of America is handing out its biggest pay awards since it started giving out additional bonuses tied to company performance six years ago, according to an internal memo sent by chief executive Brian Moynihan on Tuesday and seen by the Financial Times.\n\nThe bank will give 97 per cent of its 208,000 employees restricted stock awards worth roughly $1bn in total, but bankers will have to stick around to earn their payday in full. The special stock awards will vest in equal payments over four years starting in 2023.",

    "blurb": "Move signals further caution despite platforms’ eagerness to tap financial hub",
    "date": "2022-01-2500:00:00.0",
    "body": "Singapore’s financial regulator is clamping down on the marketing of cryptocurrency services in the city-state in a further setback for digital asset service providers looking to establish themselves in the Asian financial hub.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore on Monday published a set of guidelines instructing crypto businesses to stop marketing or advertising their offerings to retail investors in public spaces, both physical and virtual, calling the trading of such assets “highly risky and not suitable for the general public”.\n\nThe guidelines are not legally binding, but the announcement comes as authorities have already disappointed several businesses with the slow pace of approvals for platforms looking to set up operations in Singapore.\n\nEffective immediately, cryptocurrency players should not solicit customers through ads on social media platforms or other public websites, on public transport such as buses and trains or the venues where they stop, or through broadcast and print media. They are also discouraged from providing physical ATMs for dispensing crypto tokens.\n\nThese digital asset service providers should also not engage external parties, such as social media influencers, to promote their crypto-based offerings to people in Singapore.\n\nThey can, however, continue to market or advertise on their own corporate websites, mobile applications or official social media accounts.\n\n“The trading of cryptocurrencies is highly risky and not suitable for the general public,” Loo Siew Yee, MAS assistant managing director for policy, payments and financial crime, said in a press statement on Monday.\n\n“DPT service providers should therefore not portray the trading of DPTs in a manner that trivialises the high risks of trading in DPTs, nor engage in marketing activities that target the general public,” she added, referring to digital payment tokens, which Singapore’s central bank uses as a broad classification to cover cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ethereum and similar assets underpinned by blockchain technology.\n\nSingapore-based Foris DAX Asia, which operates the crypto.com trading platform, has been promoting its portal in movie theatres in the city-state. The company even splashed out to hire American actor Matt Damon to front its ads.\n\nAcross multiplex screens in Singapore, the Hollywood star has appeared in a promotional video uttering the tagline “fortune favours the brave” for crypto.com before movies start.\n\nAccording to MAS guidelines, such advertisements should no longer be used in public venues to market the wares of DPT players.\n\n“The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) requires us to provide this risk warning to you as a customer of a digital payment token (DPT) service provider,” a disclaimer on crypto.com reads. “Please note that you may not be able to recover all the money or DPTs you paid to Foris DAX Asia Pte Ltd if Foris DAX Asia Pte Ltd business fails.”\n\nWhile there is no specified penalty should crypto service providers fail to follow the guidelines, the financial regulator is likely to take note of digital asset companies that ignore the public safeguards, which may in turn affect whether they are allowed to continue operating legally in Singapore.\n\nWhile the marketing framework came into effect on January 17, DPT players are being given some leeway to wind down any advertising efforts that run contrary to the guidelines, for instance if certain contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.\n\nSingapore’s central bank is taking a similar stance on the matter to the UK, where the advertising watchdog has moved to clamp down on “misleading” marketing carried out by crypto players. The city-state’s guidelines also come as regulators across jurisdictions tighten scrutiny of the emerging crypto sector, which is known for operating across borders and away from regulatory oversight.\n\nBut for crypto players, the move by the MAS to curtail their ability to target Singaporean customers adds to the difficulty many of them already face operating in the city-state.\n\nThese businesses have raced to set up in Singapore in the past few years to leverage its status as a prominent hub for the growth of financial technology services. They run the spectrum from exchange platforms for trading crypto, to investment managers and financial advisers looking after digital asset portfolios for the wealthy. Authorities, however, have set a high benchmark for granting licences, with only a handful awarded so far.\n\nUnder Singapore’s Payment Services Act, businesses that provide offerings relating to DPTs are regulated primarily for money laundering and terrorism financing risks, as well as technology risks.\n\nTo operate legally, they need to apply for licences in the area of “digital payment token services”. Since the Act took effect in January 2020, there have been about 180 applications for permits for such services.\n\nBut only five of these have been awarded in-principle approvals, the MAS said. Sixty DPT applications were withdrawn, while three have been rejected. This failure rate comes in stark contrast to the image cast of Singapore as a crypto-friendly location relative to other jurisdictions such as China, which has banned the digital asset.\n\nIn view of the rapidly changing landscape for the industry, the MAS said it would continue to review the provision of DPT services to the public by providers and may update these guidelines as necessary.\n\nThe regulator had asked crypto stakeholders and the Singapore FinTech Association, a lobby group for tech-based financial businesses in the city-state, for feedback on the guidelines before they were published.\n\nThe SFA said in a statement that the new framework demonstrates that Singapore continues to see blockchain and cryptocurrencies as innovations that have the potential to gain mass adoption in the community, acknowledging that such adoption should be “balanced with pragmatic guardrails”.\n\n“The technology behind blockchain has the potential to open many exciting opportunities for the industry and bring benefits to consumers,” said Shadab Taiyabi, president of the SFA. “Opening the doors to innovation also requires a system of checks and balances to be put in place before consumers gain full awareness and understanding of the new tools.”\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on January 17 2022. ©2022 Nikkei Inc.

    "body": "The recently announced exchange traded fund link between the Singapore Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange will not feature fixed income ETFs or real estate investment trust products, potentially tempering enthusiasm for the scheme in its initial stages.\n\nThe two bourses signed a memorandum of understanding in December to develop an ETF connection allowing investors in Singapore and China to access feeder ETFs listed locally on each exchange.\n\nThe agreement comes amid surging growth in the Singapore ETF landscape, with locally listed ETF assets soaring 47 per cent to S$12.5bn ($9.3bn) last year, following 57 per cent growth in ETF assets in 2020.\n\nMichael Syn, Singapore-based head of equities at the Singapore Exchange, said he expected the scheme to be launched within the year but in its initial stages will permit a more limited range of products.\n\nThe focus at the start would be on equities ETFs due to their larger turnover versus fixed income ETFs, as well as the broader range of investors using equities ETFs, said Syn.\n\nThis decision would rule out most of Singapore’s largest locally listed ETFs from the link-up between the Chinese bourse and Singapore exchange.\n\nSix out of the top seven Singapore ETFs by net inflows in 2021 were fixed income or real estate investment trust (Reit) products, led by BlackRock’s iShares USD Asia High Yield Bond ETF’s S$2.94bn, which accounted for almost three-quarters of net inflows into locally listed ETFs last year.\n\nSyn noted that most fixed income ETFs were held by institutions and tended to come in very large ticket sizes, versus equities ETFs that are traded by robo-advisers, private wealth institutions and individual investors.\n\n“Our motivation isn’t just large ETFs but frequently used ETFs,” he added.\n\nReit ETFs could be the logical next step in terms of inclusion in the scheme, he added, but there was a certain amount of education needed among both onshore asset managers and Chinese investors before doing so.\n\nHowever, some in the industry believe that this approach might not be beneficial for ensuring that there is a strong initial uptake when it is eventually launched.\n\nMelody He, Hong Kong-based deputy chief executive of CSOP Asset Management, said the exclusions could temper excitement among Singapore ETF issuers for the scheme in the beginning.\n\nShe said Singapore’s fixed income and Reit ETFs were likely to be the biggest draw for investors in China, but added that regulators might have wanted to keep things simple initially, especially when retail investors are involved.\n\nKao Shih Teng, Singapore-based senior director and head of product solutions at Lion Global Investors, said that allowing for non-equities ETFs was likely to be more of a “phase-two” development.\n\nETF issuers in Singapore had frequently struggled to attract sufficient retail interest to build asset size and liquidity, but if locally listed ETFs could be distributed to Chinese investors, the probability of achieving profitability increased, CSOP AM’s He said.\n\nHowever, Ng Sze Yoon, Singapore-based senior director for Asia-Pacific insights at Broadridge, said companies will need to iron out operational and settlement issues before there could truly be connectivity between the two markets.\n\nAny ability to leverage on parent group resources will be “massively helpful”, she said, though she noted that with the size of the Chinese market, even a tiny percentage of the market was huge compared with other markets in the region.\n\n*Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

    "body": "This article is part of a guide to Singapore from FT Globetrotter\n\nYou can still find the old Singapore on screen — the vegetable farms of Potong Pasir, the hawker markets that would be turned into malls, the hubbub of Boat Quay as a working harbour. But the movies that captured those sights are mostly now lost like the landmarks themselves, left to be tracked down in grainy archive on YouTube.\n\nInstead, the (excellent) cinema of Singapore you’ll find on streaming platforms in 2022 was made in the wake of the urban redevelopment that defines the modern city. That transformed landscape is a constant presence in those movies, and often key to their stories too. They bear witness to a place that, now as then, is a patchwork of global influences — with a soul all its own.\n\nWhere to watch: available to stream on Amazon Prime\n\nIf a single director offers a one-stop-shop guide to modern Singapore, it is the prolific Eric Khoo, who broke through in the 1990s. His body of work includes panoramic social dramas set in the city-state’s ubiquitous Housing and Development Board flats (12 Storeys) and an account of the slow disappearance of its beloved hawker stalls (Wanton Mee). His most recent movie is another story of food and identity, Ramen Teh (Ramen Shop), a cross-cultural family drama with a Japanese-Singaporean chef searching for his roots — softer-edged than his earlier films but just as evocative as a portrait of Singapore.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nCranes dot the horizon in director Yeo Siew Hua’s 2018 thriller A Land Imagined. The red safety lights against the night sky make a perfect emblem for a city continually rebuilding itself to the point of reinvention. But the endless construction sites are more than just set-dressing in a 21st- century noir in which a Chinese migrant worker goes missing while toiling on a land-reclamation project. The mystery is bound up with the physical drama of Singapore’s transformation — here where vast tracts of sand imported from other countries are used to extend the very mass of the city.\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime, Apple TV, YouTube and other platforms\n\nThe same year that A Land Imagined tackled the darker realities of Singapore, the city-state was also host to a giddy cultural juggernaut that seduced audiences worldwide. Crazy Rich Asians is the fairytale of a New Yorker who discovers her boyfriend is part of an immensely wealthy family of Singapore aristocrats. Under the soapy surface is a droll clash of old and new money, themes of class and social climbing. The gleam of modern luxury also comes with a hint of the grander end of the city’s past. The palatial interiors — stuffed tiger included — were based on old family photographs contributed by the writer of the bestselling source novel, Kevin Kwan, descended from the founder of OCBC Bank.\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime, Apple TV and other platforms\n\nIf Crazy Rich Asians had a hint of autobiography, the acclaimed Ilo Ilo was also shaped by the early life of its creator. But the experience of director Anthony Chen was very different from that of Kevin Kwan. Backdropped by the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the film was tied up with the lack of work-life balance that has long afflicted ordinary Singaporeans. Its Chinese title is “Mom and Dad Aren’t Home” — and for the parents of a near-delinquent 10-year-old, their jobs are so demanding of time that a Filipino domestic helper, Teresa, is hired to look after the boy. The story that follows is steeped in the detail of Singapore, from “Singlish” dialogue through haircuts and fashions to the financial precarity of the central family — and Teresa’s uncertain place in the city.\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime\n\nIf most of the films here are rooted in the modern Singapore, the sleazy brio of Saint Jack caught the city in a moment of transformation. It is also a Hollywood curio with a rum back-story. The starting point was Paul Theroux’s novel of an American pimp. The book caught the attention of no less than Orson Welles; he recommended it to actress Cybill Shepherd; she duly secured the film rights as part of a legal settlement, having sued Playboy for printing photos of her on set in the late, great Peter Bogdanovich’s The Last Picture Show. The film of Saint Jack went ahead in 1979 with Bogdanovich directing. With a local cast supporting star Ben Gazzara, Bogdanovich shot in a Singapore soon to be literally demolished or — like the infamous Bugis Street night market — transformed from fleshpot to tourist attraction. The whole thing was too much for the authorities, who banned the movie until 2006.\n\nWhere to watch: DVD\n\nFormer president SR Nathan was among those who hailed the realism of the 2006 comedy Singapore Dreaming. Yet the movie lies some way from the rose-tinted visions usually enjoyed by politicians. Instead, it is a satire of life at the sharper end of the city-state’s economy, where a lottery win is only the beginning of the problems for an ordinary family plagued by their aspirations to the “5Cs” said to make up the Singapore Dream (cash, car, condo, credit card and country club).\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nAnother snapshot of Singapore at a moment frozen in time, Shirkers is a charming punky comedy-thriller made in 1992 by young director Sandi Tan and two friends — and a documentary about the strange events that happened next. That movie-after-the-fact centres on the American expat film tutor who acted as Tan’s mentor, then absconded with the footage. Three decades later, Tan returned to the mystery of her movie — telling a tale of youthful vision and adult skulduggery that also acts as a heady time capsule of the city it was made in.\n\nWhat’s your favourite film set in Singapore?

    "body": "The Omicron coronavirus variant has brought the slow reopening of Asia to a juddering halt as governments rush to reimpose travel restrictions even though the new strain is already circulating in the local community.\n\nThailand and Singapore this week joined Japan in closing their borders to most foreign travellers. All three countries have reported domestic cases of the highly transmissible new variant, suggesting Omicron will spread even without new arrivals from abroad.\n\nThe latest travel restrictions highlight Asia’s hard line against the virus and threaten to hamper the region’s economic recovery in 2022.\n\nJeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda in Jakarta, said the economic impact of Omicron in Asia had, so far, been limited because there was little travel activity to halt. “One thing we can be grateful for is this has come now rather than a few months down the line when people had opened up more,” he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thailand suspended registration for its “Test & Go” travel scheme, launched on November 1, which allowed fully vaccinated visitors to enter the country without quarantining if they tested negative for Covid-19.\n\nThe Thai government also suspended registrations for its “Sandbox” quarantine-free travel schemes opened in selected tourist spots around the country, apart from the flagship programme on the island of Phuket, which was launched on July 1.\n\nBangkok said it would still allow about 200,000 people who had already lodged applications or been approved for the two schemes to enter, and said it would revisit the measures after January 4.\n\nThe temporary closure is, however, a setback for Thailand’s vaunted reopening of its tourism industry, which collapsed during the pandemic after the country sealed its borders to most foreign visitors and introduced quarantine requirements from April 2020.\n\nSingapore said it would suspend ticket sales for fully vaccinated travellers seeking to visit from about two dozen countries covered under its vaccinated travel lane (VTL) scheme, which include the US, UK, and Germany.\n\nThe health ministry said no new tickets would be issued for people arriving from these countries from December 23 to January 20, and that Singapore would temporarily reduce the number of tickets sold under the scheme after January 20.\n\nLike Thailand, Singapore said it would allow travellers who already held flight tickets booked on the scheme before December 22 to enter, provided they met all the VTL conditions.\n\nIn Japan, the city of Osaka reported the country’s first known Omicron cases without a link to foreign travel.\n\n“Because this virus is an unknown we must throw in all our resources,” said Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. “In a crisis, it’s better to do too much than too little, too late.”\n\nNew Zealand and Hong Kong, which have both kept Covid cases to a minimum through some of the world’s toughest border restrictions, have not yet reported domestic transmission of Omicron. Both have stepped up their border controls.\n\nThe New Zealand government has postponed its phased reopening of the border, pushing back plans for quarantine-free travel with Australia from January 16 until the end of February. It also extended quarantine for arriving citizens from seven days to 10 and shrunk the window for a pre-flight Covid test from 72 hours to 48.\n\nChris Hipkins, the minister in charge of New Zealand’s Covid response, said reopening the border was too high a risk.\n\n“Our immediate job right now must be to slow it down and delay it from entering the New Zealand community for as long as we possibly can,” he said.\n\nHong Kong recorded seven new Omicron cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases for the highly transmissible variant to 34. Although all of the cases were imported, and most were detected during isolation, local health authorities have increased virus-testing efforts and tightened quarantine rules.\n\nThe Chinese territory has banned non-residents from more than 90 countries from entering while residents must undergo three weeks of quarantine.\n\nHong Kong residents arriving from the UK and US, along with 12 African countries on the “highest-risk” list, must spend their first four days after arrival in the government-run Penny’s Bay quarantine camp. They must then spend 17 days of isolation in a designated hotel.",

    "body": "This is the third in a Nikkei Asia series on supply chain nightmares. Read also Apple’s nightmare before Christmas, a look at how the crisis finally reached the maker of the iPhone, and Automakers hit limits of ‘just-in-time’ supply chain management, on the car industry’s nightmare year.\n\nA dozen cranes stack giant concrete structures and heavy machines roar as they dig the ground at a massive construction site in the northern part of Singapore, near the Johor Strait, where the island nation shares its border with Malaysia.\n\nThe $4bn project began six months ago at the Woodlands Wafer Fab Park, one of Singapore’s semiconductor manufacturing clusters. The site will house a new semiconductor factory of US contract chipmaker GlobalFoundries, and is expected to start production in 2023.\n\nGlobalFoundries, whose largest shareholder is Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment, already operates several chip fabs in the island nation. It is adding 23,000 sq metres of cleanroom space and new administrative offices at the site. When completed, the company will boost annual capacity by 450,000 wafers, bringing the Singapore campus up to approximately 1.5m wafers per year. The company also plans to expand capacity at its sites in the US and Germany.\n\n“It took 50 years for the industry to grow to half a trillion dollars today, and now it is estimated that the industry will grow to a trillion in roughly eight years,” GlobalFoundries CEO Tom Caulfield said at the Singapore groundbreaking ceremony, which was held virtually in June, referring to the chip industry’s annual revenue. “It is hard to overstate the amount of investment and focus the industry will have to deliver to meet this challenge.”\n\nCaulfield is just one of many chip executives optimistic about the industry’s growth and it is not only in Singapore where new fabs are being planned. It is happening all over the world, including Taiwan, the US, South Korea, Europe and Japan. Chip manufacturers worldwide — including the three giants, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, Samsung Electronics and Intel — are rapidly increasing their global manufacturing footprints and capacity.\n\nIndustry organisation SEMI estimated in June that construction on close to 30 new fabs will start by the end of 2022. In September it predicted global semiconductor equipment investment for front-end fabs, where the silicon wafers are processed, will be nearly $100bn next year, after topping $90bn this year — both records. This will mark a “rare three consecutive years of growth that began in 2020, bucking the historical cyclical trend of a one or two-year expansion followed by a year or two of tepid growth or declines”, SEMI said.\n\nAn unprecedented global chip shortage has given semiconductor industry executives confidence to expand capacity. On top of this, governments in the US, Europe, Japan and elsewhere have committed to spend billions of dollars to expand semiconductor production within their own borders — measures designed to protect against supply chain disruptions like those caused by the pandemic and to reduce reliance on production in Taiwan.\n\nMeanwhile, China, the biggest consumer of chips globally, is ramping up its own investment to achieve a goal of 70 per cent self-sufficiency in semiconductors by 2025. Analysts at Moody’s in August said this would support China’s tech progress but that there was the potential for overcapacity and investment inefficiency, adding extra uncertainty over global chip supply and demand.\n\n“I’ve never seen this level of government money poured into the semiconductor sector,” said Akira Minamikawa, senior consulting director of UK-based research company Omdia, who has been a close industry watcher since the 1980s.\n\nIn the past, the Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese governments invested heavily in the industry, “but this happened continuously over a long period of time. This time, it’s happening simultaneously,” Minamikawa told Nikkei Asia. Building resilience and minimising dependency on the global chip supply chain means that there will be redundancy. At some point, he predicts, “there will be an imbalance between the supply and demand for sure, and it’s a matter of when that is the question”.\n\nMinamikawa is not alone in his forecast. Research group IDC in September said the semiconductor market is on course to grow by 17.3 per cent in 2021 versus 10.8 per cent in 2020, with growth driven by mobile phones, notebooks, servers and more sophisticated cars. But it said there is a potential for overcapacity in 2023 as large-scale capacity expansion begins to come online toward the end of next year.\n\nMario Morales, group vice-president of IDC, told Nikkei that “we can argue that a lot of the capacities are going to be needed because we’re still seeing very good secular semiconductor market growth”. However, he added, “we started seeing a slowdown in consumer sentiment”. IDC expects that the growth of the PC market will probably be flat in 2022, especially after heated demand during the pandemic, as society shifted rapidly to remote work and online classes.\n\nMorales already thinks that some of the investment plans made by chip companies might be pushed back or even cancelled in the future. “I don’t think all of it will be realised,” he said. “But it’s going to be enough that I think that could turn the corner and really change the dynamics that we’re seeing.”\n\nIn fact, the fine print in the share prospectus of GlobalFoundries, which went public on Nasdaq in October, sets out risks in the industry that Caulfield and other chip executives rarely touch upon publicly.\n\n“The seasonality and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and periodic overcapacity make us vulnerable to significant and sometimes prolonged economic downturns,” it states. “Overcapacity in the semiconductor industry may reduce our revenues, earnings, and margins . . . Strong government support in China for capacity expansion, combined with weaker demand from and strained economic relations with that country, could lead to underutilisation or significant ASP (average selling prices) erosion for fab fill.”\n\nThe giant chipmakers are planning their mega-investments at a time when the supply-demand picture is more obscure than ever. Since the chip shortage intensified from the beginning of the year, a broad range of customers — including the manufacturers of smartphones, consumer electronics and cars — have been ordering more than they need because they fear not getting what they want.\n\nNobody in the industry seems to know what the actual demand is, “and that is the risk”, said Minamikawa.\n\n“Figuring out how many orders are ‘double orders’ and even ‘phantom orders’ is a million-dollar question,” said Renesas Electronics CEO Hidetoshi Shibata, at the Japanese chipmaker’s most recent earnings announcement in October. While the company posted record profit driven by demand for chips from the car industry, Shibata said that Renesas had to exclude even some “noncancelable” and “nonreturnable” orders from earnings forecasts “since we judge some of them as inflated orders”.\n\n“No one has any visibility in the next two years,” said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive officer of VLSI Research, who has been in the industry for more than 40 years. “We will see oversupply, but that’s not a concern . . . We overproduce, and then a year or two later, we get into negative growth, we come back. That’s just the history of the industry. It’s cyclical.”\n\nIf there is a supply glut, it may not apply equally across the different types of chips.\n\nMost of the new capacity being added by contract chipmakers — like the plant that TSMC announced it will build in Kumamoto, Japan, in a joint investment with Sony Group and which will be subsidised by the Japanese government to the tune of billions of dollars — is in relatively mature technology, chips in the 22 to 90-nanometer range. The size refers to the line width between transistors on a chip. The smaller the size, generally, the more challenging and expensive the chip is to produce.\n\nThis mature technology is used in a wide range of chips from sensors and microcontrollers to power management chips, and is where the present global chip shortage has been most acute. Major contract chipmakers will increase capacity for such chips by about 40 per cent from 2021 to 2025, Dale Gai, research director with Counterpoint, told Nikkei.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting-edge chips requiring 10-nanometer technology or finer, suitable for building CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators and networking processors, will more than double from now to 2025, the research agency estimates. But this expansion is from a low base. Cutting-edge production capacity only accounts for about 11 per cent of global semiconductor output from contract chipmakers.\n\n“We are more concerned about those more mature chip production technologies and whether that addition will be sustainable when that new capacity becomes ready by 2023 or 2024,” said Gai. “The area is much more crowded.”\n\nThere are signs of a slowdown in demand emerging already in memory chips, reflecting slower sales primarily of PCs, which were in heavy demand during the pandemic.\n\nThe bulk price of 8 GB “double data rate 4” memory — a benchmark for dynamic random-access memory used in computers — has declined for four consecutive months since August. Key players such as US-based Micron Technology and South Korea’s SK Hynix have reported a steady decline in inventory. Micron in September announced a financial forecast for the fiscal first quarter that was well below analysts’ expectations.\n\nCompanies are urging their investors to think long term and to consider structural changes that will justify increased capacity.\n\n“The way we look at the factory is always long term,” Helmut Gassel, chief marketing officer and member of the management board of Infineon Technologies, a German chip giant, told Nikkei. The company recently opened a new fab in Villach, Austria, to ramp up output of power semiconductors primarily used in the auto industry, particularly in electric vehicles and hybrids.\n\n“When we announced the manufacturing . . . site in Villach in 2018, people were wondering. And now they all are thinking we did great,” Gassel said. “We have grown as a company — 10 per cent per year for over the past 20 years — and you know you have to build the next step in order to be able to serve the market,” he said. “When you believe in structural growth and continuous growth, then you will need to add fabs. And when you add too many at one point? Well, then you will have a break. But eventually, demand will always grow to the capacity that has been built.”\n\nGassel may be right. Although the demand for smartphones and PCs may decline over the year, new applications such as EVs, autonomous vehicles, the internet of things and smart cities will surely emerge. Shifts to cloud computing driven by heavy investments in data centres filled with servers, made by cash-rich US companies, will also increase.\n\nBut it is also true that the chip industry has experienced significant fluctuations, saddling manufacturers with excess capacity built up during boom years once the market cools. “The only way to minimise this risk is to make precise demand forecasts, but this is very difficult to do, especially in the current market condition,” said Minamikawa.\n\nA version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on December 15 2021. ©2021 Nikkei Inc.
