Purpose and Policy. On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense \nmandated that all service members receive the COVID–19 vaccine. The Sec-\nretary of Defense later rescinded the mandate on January 10, 2023. The vaccine mandate was an unfair, overbroad, and completely unnecessary burden on our service members. Further, the military unjustly discharged those who refused the vaccine, regardless of the years of service given to our Nation, after failing to grant many of them an exemption that they should have received. Federal Government redress of any wrongful dismissals is overdue. \nSec. 2. Redress. Consistent with the policies announced in section 1 of \nthis order, the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nas appropriate, shall take all necessary action permitted by law to: \n(a) make reinstatement available to all members of the military (active \nand reserve) who were discharged solely for refusal to receive the COVID– 19 vaccine and who request to be reinstated; \n(b) enable those service members reinstated under this section to revert \nto their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments, or compensation; and \n(c) allow any service members who provide a written and sworn attestation \nthat they voluntarily left the service or allowed their service to lapse accord-ing to appropriate procedures, rather than be vaccinated under the vaccine mandate, to return to service with no impact on their service status, rank, or pay. \nSec. 3. Additional Agency Responsibilities. (a) Nothing in this order precludes \ndisciplinary or administrative action for conduct that is proscribed by chapter \n47 of title 10, United States Code (Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. 801–946a). \n(b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense \nand the Secretary of Homeland Security shall report to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs on their progress in implementing this order. \nSec. 4.

Purpose. The threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise \nmissiles, and other advanced aerial attacks, remains the most catastrophic \nthreat facing the United States. \nPresident Ronald Reagan endeavored to build an effective defense against \nnuclear attacks, and while this program resulted in many technological advances, it was canceled before its goal could be realized. And since \nthe United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and initiated development of limited homeland missile defense, official United States homeland missile defense policy has remained only to stay ahead of rogue-nation threats and accidental or unauthorized missile launches. \nOver the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation \nstrategic weapons has become more intense and complex with the develop-ment by peer and near-peer adversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland integrated air and missile defense capabilities. \nSec. 2. Policy. To further the goal of peace through strength, it is the \npolicy of the United States that: \n(a) The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens \nand the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile \ndefense shield; \n(b) The United States will deter—and defend its citizens and critical \ninfrastructure against—any foreign aerial attack on the Homeland; and \n(c) The United States will guarantee its secure second-strike capability. \nSec. 3. Implementation. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary \nof Defense shall: \n(a) Submit to the President a reference architecture, capabilities-based \nrequirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield. The architecture shall include, at a minimum, plans for: \n(i) Defense of the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near- peer, and rogue adversaries; \n(ii) Acceleration of the deployment of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking \nSpace Sensor layer; \n(iii) Development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors \ncapable of boost-phase intercept; \n(iv) Deployment of underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities \npostured to defeat a countervalue attack; \n(v) Development and deployment of a custody layer of the Proliferated \nWarfighter Space Architecture; \n(vi) Development and deployment of capabilities to defeat missile attacks \nprior to launch and in the boost phase; \n(vii) Development and deployment of a secure supply chain for all compo-\nnents with next-generation security and resilience features; and \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:43 Jan 31, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\03FEE3.SGM 03FEE3khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOC6\n8768 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 21 / Monday, February 3, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(viii) Development and deployment of non-kinetic capabilities to augment \nthe kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks; \n(b) Review relevant authorities and organization of the Department of \nDefense to develop and deploy capabilities at the necessary speed to imple-\nment this directive; \n(c) Jointly with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \nsubmit to the President a plan to fund this directive, allowing sufficient time for consideration by the President before finalization of the Fiscal Year 2026 Budget; and \n(d) In cooperation with United States Strategic Command and United \nStates Northern Command, submit to the President: \n(i) An updated assessment of the strategic missile threat to the Homeland; and \n(ii) A prioritized set of locations to progressively defend against a counter-\nvalue attack by nuclear adversaries. \nSec. 4. Allied and Theater Missile Defense Review. The United States con-\ntinues to cooperate on missile defense with its allies and partners to aid in the defense of ally populations and troops and of forward-deployed United States troops. Following the submission to the President of the next- generation missile defense reference architecture under section 3(a) of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall direct a review of theater missile defense posture and initiatives to identify ways in which the United States and its allies and partners can: \n(a) Increase bilateral and multilateral cooperation on missile defense tech-\nnology development, capabilities, and operations; \n(b) Improve theater missile defenses of forward-deployed United States \ntroops and allied territories, troops, and populations; and \n(c) Increase and accelerate the provision of United States missile defense \ncapabilities to allies and partners. \nSec. 5.

Purpose. As Chief Executive and as Commander in Chief, I am \ncommitted to meritocracy and to the elimination of race-based and sex- \nbased discrimination within the Armed Forces of the United States. No individual or group within our Armed Forces should be preferred or dis-advantaged on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, color, or creed. \nUnfortunately, in recent years civilian and uniformed leadership alike have \nimplemented Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs and their at-tendant race and sex preferences within the Armed Forces. These actions undermine leadership, merit, and unit cohesion, thereby eroding lethality and force readiness.

It is the policy of my Administration that the Department \nof Defense, the Department of Homeland Security with regard to the United \nStates Coast Guard (USCG), and every element of the Armed Forces should operate free from any preference based on race or sex. \nSec. 3.

Abolishing the DEI Bureaucracy. The Secretary of Defense and the \nSecretary of Homeland Security shall abolish every DEI office within the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security with regard to the USCG, respectively, including any vestiges of DEI offices, such as sub-offices, programs, elements, or initiatives established to promote a race- based preferences system that subverts meritocracy, perpetuates unconstitu-tional discrimination, and promotes divisive concepts or gender ideology. \nSec. 5. Department of Defense Internal Review. The Secretary of Defense \nshall conduct an internal review that documents actions taken in pursuit \nof DEI initiatives, including all instances of race and sex discrimination and activities designed to promote a race- or sex-based preferences system.

In addition, these institutions shall be required to teach that America and its founding documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history. \nSec. 7. Implementation.

The order mandates a review of existing medical guidelines, defunding of related practices, and regulatory actions to protect children from irreversible medical interventions. Key agencies must report progress within 60 days, ensuring compliance with this directive to safeguard children's health.",

        "body": "Presidential Documents8771 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 21 / Monday, February 3, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nExecutive Order 14187 of January 28, 2025 \nProtecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation \nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: \nSection 1. Policy and Purpose. Across the country today, medical profes-\nsionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable \nchildren under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child’s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions. This dangerous trend will be a stain on our Nation’s history, and it must end. \nCountless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin \nto grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding. More-over, these vulnerable youths’ medical bills may rise throughout their life-times, as they are often trapped with lifelong medical complications, a losing war with their own bodies, and, tragically, sterilization. \nAccordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, \nsponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘‘transition’’ of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures. \nSec. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this order: \n(a) The term ‘‘child’’ or ‘‘children’’ means an individual or individuals \nunder 19 years of age. \n(b) The term ‘‘pediatric’’ means relating to the medical care of a child. (c) The phrase ‘‘chemical and surgical mutilation’’ means the use of puberty \nblockers, including GnRH agonists and other interventions, to delay the \nonset or progression of normally timed puberty in an individual who does \nnot identify as his or her sex; the use of sex hormones, such as androgen blockers, estrogen, progesterone, or testosterone, to align an individual’s physical appearance with an identity that differs from his or her sex; and surgical procedures that attempt to transform an individual’s physical appear-ance to align with an identity that differs from his or her sex or that attempt to alter or remove an individual’s sexual organs to minimize or destroy their natural biological functions. This phrase sometimes is referred to as ‘‘gender affirming care.’’ \nSec. 3. Ending Reliance on Junk Science. (a) The blatant harm done to \nchildren by chemical and surgical mutilation cloaks itself in medical neces-\nsity, spurred by guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which lacks scientific integrity.

Purpose and Policy. Parents trust America’s schools to provide \ntheir children with a rigorous education and to instill a patriotic admiration \nfor our incredible Nation and the values for which we stand. \nIn recent years, however, parents have witnessed schools indoctrinate their \nchildren in radical, anti-American ideologies while deliberately blocking parental oversight. Such an environment operates as an echo chamber, in which students are forced to accept these ideologies without question or critical examination. In many cases, innocent children are compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics. In other instances, young men and women are made to question whether they were born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their reality as enemies to be blamed. These practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity. \nImprinting anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on our \nNation’s children not only violates longstanding anti-discrimination civil rights law in many cases, but usurps basic parental authority. For example, steering students toward surgical and chemical mutilation without parental consent or involvement or allowing males access to private spaces designated for females may contravene Federal laws that protect parental rights, includ-ing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Protec-tion of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), and sex-based equality and oppor-tunity, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX). Similarly, demanding acquiescence to ‘‘White Privilege’’ or ‘‘unconscious bias,’’ actually promotes racial discrimination and undermines national unity. \nMy Administration will enforce the law to ensure that recipients of Federal \nfunds providing K–12 education comply with all applicable laws prohibiting discrimination in various contexts and protecting parental rights, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), 42 U.S.C. 2000d et \nseq.; Title IX, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.; FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; and the \nPPRA, 20 U.S.C. 1232h. \nSec. 2. Definitions. As used herein: \n(a) The definitions in the Executive Order ‘‘Defending Women from Gender \nIdeology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Govern-\nment’’ (January 20, 2025) shall apply to this order. \n(b) ‘‘Discriminatory equity ideology’’ means an ideology that treats individ-\nuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals, and minimizes agency, merit, and capability in favor of immoral generaliza-tions, including that: \n(i) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally or inherently superior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; \n(ii) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national \norigin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:33 Jan 31, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\03FEE7.SGM 03FEE7khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOCA\n8854 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 21 / Monday, February 3, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(iii) An individual’s moral character or status as privileged, oppressing, \nor oppressed is primarily determined by the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin; \n(iv) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should \nnot attempt to treat others without respect to their race, color, sex, or national origin; \n(v) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national \norigin, bears responsibility for, should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of, should be discriminated against, blamed, or stereotyped for, or should receive adverse treatment because of actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin, in which the individual played no part; \n(vi) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national \norigin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion; \n(vii) Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, \nobjectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; or \n(viii) the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise dis-\ncriminatory. \n(c) ‘‘Educational service agency’’ (ESA) has the meaning given in 20 U.S.C. \n1401(5), and the terms ‘‘elementary school,’’ ‘‘local educational agency’’ \n(LEA), ‘‘secondary school,’’ and ‘‘state educational agency’’ (SEA) have the meanings given in 34 CFR 77.1(c). \n(d) ‘‘Patriotic education’’ means a presentation of the history of America \ngrounded in: \n(i) an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles; \n(ii) a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown \ncloser to its noble principles throughout its history; \n(iii) the concept that commitment to America’s aspirations is beneficial \nand justified; and \n(iv) the concept that celebration of America’s greatness and history is \nproper. \n(e) ‘‘Social transition’’ means the process of adopting a ‘‘gender identity’’ \nor ‘‘gender marker’’ that differs from a person’s sex. This process can include \npsychological or psychiatric counseling or treatment by a school counselor or other provider; modifying a person’s name (e.g., ‘‘Jane’’ to ‘‘James’’) or pronouns (e.g., ‘‘him’’ to ‘‘her’’); calling a child ‘‘nonbinary’’; use of intimate facilities and accommodations such as bathrooms or locker rooms specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex; and participating in school athletic competitions or other extracurricular activities specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex. ‘‘Social transition’’ does not include chemical or surgical mutilation. \nSec. 3.

Purpose. Parents want and deserve the best education for their \nchildren. But too many children do not thrive in their assigned, government- \nrun K–12 school. According to this year’s National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent were below proficient in math. Moreover, geographically based school assignments exacerbate the cost of housing in districts with preferred schools, straining the finances of millions of American families sacrificing for their children’s futures. \nWhen our public education system fails such a large segment of society, \nit hinders our national competitiveness and devastates families and commu-nities. For this reason, more than a dozen States have enacted universal K–12 scholarship programs, allowing families—rather than the government— to choose the best educational setting for their children. These States have highlighted the most promising avenue for education reform: educational choice for families and competition for residentially assigned, government- run public schools. The growing body of rigorous research demonstrates that well-designed education-freedom programs improve student achievement and cause nearby public schools to improve their performance. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of my Administration to support parents \nin choosing and directing the upbringing and education of their children. Sec. 3. Guidance on Supporting State-based K–12 Educational Choice. Within \n60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education shall issue \nguidance regarding how States can use Federal formula funds to support K–12 educational choice initiatives. \nSec. 4. Encouraging Education Freedom through Discretionary Grant Pro-\ngrams. (a) The Secretary of Education shall include education freedom as \na priority in discretionary grant programs, as appropriate and consistent \nwith applicable law. \n(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Labor \nand the Secretary of Education shall review their respective discretionary grant programs and each submit a plan to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, that identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations regarding using relevant discretionary grant programs to expand education freedom for America’s families and teachers. \nSec. 5. Expanding Opportunities for Low-Income, Working Families. Within \n90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices shall issue guidance regarding whether and how States receiving block grants for families and children from the Department, including the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDGB), can use them to expand educational choice and support families who choose educational alternatives to governmental entities, including private and faith-based options. \nSec. 6.

Helping Children Eligible for Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) \nSchools. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the \nInterior shall review any available mechanisms under which families of \nstudents eligible to attend BIE schools may use their Federal funding for educational options of their choice, including private, faith-based, or public charter schools, and submit a plan to the President describing such mecha-nisms and the steps that would be necessary to implement them for the 2025–26 school year.

        "body": "Presidential Documents8625 \nFederal Register \nVol. 90, No. 20 \nFriday, January 31, 2025 \nTitle 3— \nThe President Executive Order 14171 of January 20, 2025 \nRestoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions With-\nin the Federal Workforce \nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States of America, including sections 3301, 3302, and 7511 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: \nSection 1. Purpose. Article II of the United States Constitution vests the \nPresident with the sole and exclusive authority over the executive branch, \nincluding the authority to manage the Federal workforce to ensure effective execution of Federal law. A critical aspect of this executive function is the responsibility to maintain professionalism and accountability within the civil service. This accountability is sorely lacking today. Only 41 percent of civil service supervisors are confident that they can remove an employee who engaged in insubordination or serious misconduct. Even fewer super-visors—26 percent—are confident that they can remove an employee for poor performance. \nAccountability is essential for all Federal employees, but it is especially \nimportant for those who are in policy-influencing positions. These personnel are entrusted to shape and implement actions that have a significant impact on all Americans. Any power they have is delegated by the President, and they must be accountable to the President, who is the only member of the executive branch, other than the Vice President, elected and directly accountable to the American people. In recent years, however, there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career Federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership. Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. \nSec. 2. Reinstatement of Prior Administration Policy. Executive Order 13957 \nof October 21, 2020 (Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service), is hereby \nimmediately reinstated with full force and effect, subject to the amendments described in section 3 of this order; provided that the date of this order shall be treated as the date of Executive Order 13957. \nSec. 3. Amendments to Prior Administration Policy. Executive Order 13957 \nis amended as follows: \n(a) replace the letter ‘‘F’’ throughout, when used to designate an excepted \nservice schedule, with the words ‘‘Policy/Career’’; \n(b) in section 1: \n(i) remove the text between the words ‘‘make necessary’’ in the seventh \nparagraph and ‘‘excepting such positions’’ in the eighth paragraph; and \n(ii) insert the text ‘‘competitive service and the’’ immediately before the \nwords ‘‘adverse action procedures’’ in the eighth paragraph; \n(c) in section 4(a)(i), replace the word ‘‘Positions’’ with the words ‘‘Career \npositions’’ in the final paragraph; \n(d) in section 4(b)(i), add the text ‘‘providing for the application of Civil \nService Rule 6.3(a) to Schedule Policy/Career positions and’’ after the words \n‘‘as appropriate’’; \n(e) in section 5: \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:39 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\31JAE0.SGM 31JAE0ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E0\n8626 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 20 / Friday, January 31, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(i) insert the words ‘‘recommend that the President’’ immediately after \nthe words ‘‘petition the Director to’’ in subsection (a)(i); \n(ii) insert the following text at the end of subsection (c): ‘‘(vi) directly or indirectly supervising employees in Schedule Policy/ \nCareer positions; or \n(vii) duties that the Director otherwise indicates may be appropriate for \ninclusion in Schedule Policy/Career.’’; and \n(iii) amend subsection (d) to read ‘‘The Director shall promptly recommend \nto the President which positions should be placed in Schedule Policy/ Career.’’; \n(f) in section 6: (i) designate the existing text as new subsection \n‘‘(a)’’; (ii) insert a new subsection (b) that reads: ‘‘(b) Employees in or applicants for Schedule Policy/Career positions are \nnot required to personally or politically support the current President or the policies of the current administration. They are required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the President. Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal.’’ \nSec. 4. Conforming Regulatory Changes. The Director of the Office of Per-\nsonnel Management (Director) shall promptly amend the Civil Service Regula-tions to rescind all changes made by the final rule of April 9, 2024, ‘‘Uphold-ing Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles,’’ 89 Fed. Reg. 24982, that impede the purposes of or would otherwise affect the implementa-tion of Executive Order 13957.

Additional Positions for Consideration. Within 30 days of the date \nof this order, the Director shall, after consultation with the Executive Office \nof the President, issue guidance about additional categories of positions that executive departments and agencies should consider recommending for Schedule Policy/Career. \nSec. 6. Revocation. Executive Order 14003 of January 22, 2021 (Protecting \nthe Federal Workforce), is hereby revoked, and any rules, regulations, guid-\nance, or other agency policies effectuated under Executive Order 14003 shall not be enforced. The heads of each executive department and agency shall review and identify existing agency actions relating to or arising under section 3(e)(v) and 3(f) of Executive Order 14003 (relating to suspending, revising, or rescinding revisions to discipline and unacceptable performance policies) and, as soon as practicable, suspend, revise, or rescind such actions identified in the review. \nSec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed \nto impair or otherwise affect: \n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, \nor the head thereof; or \n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. \n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and \nsubject to the availability of appropriations. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:39 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\31JAE0.SGM 31JAE0ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E0\n8627 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 20 / Friday, January 31, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, \nsubstantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party \nagainst the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. \nTHE WHITE HOUSE, \nJanuary 20, 2025. \n[FR Doc. 2025–02095 \nFiled 1–30–25; 8:45 am] \nBilling code 3395–F4–P \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:39 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\31JAE0.SGM 31JAE0\nTrump.EPS</GPH>ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E0",

As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans. \nYet today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, critical and influential institutions of American society, including the Federal Government, major corporations, financial institutions, the med-ical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and insti-tutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, de-meaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called ‘‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’’ (DEI) or ‘‘diversity, equity, inclu-sion, and accessibility’’ (DEIA) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation. \nIllegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our \nlongstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system. Hard-working Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex. \nThese illegal DEI and DEIA policies also threaten the safety of American \nmen, women, and children across the Nation by diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society, including all levels of government, and the medical, aviation, and law-enforcement communities. Yet in case after tragic case, the American people have wit-nessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of illegal, pernicious discrimi-nation that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing. \nThe Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws. \nThe purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil \nrights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence, \nand hard work. I therefore order all executive departments and agencies (agencies) to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, con-sent orders, and requirements. I further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI pref-erences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities. \nSec. 3.

Purpose. The American story is one of boundless creativity and \nbold ambition, driven by an indomitable pioneering spirit that propels explo-\nration and discovery. It is this spirit that illuminated the world with Edison’s lightbulb, carried the Wright brothers into the skies, and sent Armstrong to the moon. Today, a new frontier of scientific discovery lies before us, defined by transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence, quan-tum computing, and advanced biotechnology. Breakthroughs in these fields have the potential to reshape the global balance of power, spark entirely new industries, and revolutionize the way we live and work. As our global competitors race to exploit these technologies, it is a national security impera-tive for the United States to achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchal-lenged global technological dominance. To secure our future, we must har-ness the full power of American innovation by empowering entrepreneurs, unleashing private-sector creativity, and reinvigorating our research institu-tions. \nAt the heart of scientific progress lies the pursuit of truth. But this \nfoundational principle, which has driven every major breakthrough in our history, is increasingly under threat. Today, across science, medicine, and technology, ideological dogmas have surfaced that elevate group identity above individual achievement, enforce conformity at the expense of innova-tive ideas, and inject politics into the heart of the scientific method. These agendas have not only distorted truth but have eroded public trust, under-mined the integrity of research, stifled innovation, and weakened America’s competitive edge. This order establishes the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to unite the brightest minds from academia, industry, and government to guide our Nation through this critical moment by charting a path forward for American leadership in science and tech-nology. \nSec. 2. Establishment. (a) There is hereby established the President’s Council \nof Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). \n(b) The PCAST shall be composed of not more than 24 members. The \nAssistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST) and the Special \nAdvisor for AI & Crypto shall be members of the PCAST. If also serving as the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the APST may designate the U.S. Chief Technology Officer as a member. The remaining members shall be distinguished individuals and representatives from sectors outside of the Federal Government appointed by the President. These non- Federal members shall have diverse perspectives and expertise in science, technology, education, and innovation. \n(c) The APST and the Special Advisor for AI & Crypto shall serve as \nCo-Chairs of the PCAST. The Co-Chairs may designate up to two Vice Chairs of the PCAST from among the non-Federal members of the PCAST, to support the Co-Chairs in the leadership and organization of the PCAST. \nSec. 3. Functions. (a) The PCAST shall advise the President on matters \ninvolving science, technology, education, and innovation policy.

Administration.

Purpose and Policy. It is in the national interest to promote \nthe extraordinary heritage of our Nation and ensure future generations of \nAmerican citizens celebrate the legacy of our American heroes. The naming of our national treasures, including breathtaking natural wonders and historic works of art, should honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans in our Nation’s rich past. \nSec. 2. Appointments to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. (a) Within \nseven days of the date of this order, each agency head with authority \nto appoint members to the Board on Geographic Names (Board) pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 364a, shall review their respective appointees and consider replacing those appointees in accordance with applicable law. \n(b) The Secretary of the Interior shall review and consider additional \nappointments to the Board to assist in fulfilling all aspects of this order, subject to all applicable laws. \n(c) With respect to all applications for naming and renaming submitted \nto the newly constituted Board, the Board shall advance the policy estab-lished in section 1 of this order to honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans and may update its principles, policies, and proce-dures as needed to achieve this policy. \n(d) Where Congressional action is required to establish a renaming in \npublic law, following Board approval on renaming, the Board shall provide guidance to all relevant Federal agencies to use the Board-approved name in the interim in federal documents and achieve consistency across the federal government. \nSec. 3. Renaming of Mount McKinley. (a) President William McKinley, the \n25th President of the United States, heroically led our Nation to victory \nin the Spanish-American War. Under his leadership, the United States en-joyed rapid economic growth and prosperity, including an expansion of territorial gains for the Nation. President McKinley championed tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing, boost domestic production, and drive U.S. indus-trialization and global reach to new heights. He was tragically assassinated in an attack on our Nation’s values and our success, and he should be honored for his steadfast commitment to American greatness. \nIn 1917, the country officially honored President McKinley through the \nnaming of North America’s highest peak. Yet after nearly a century, President Obama’s administration, in 2015, stripped the McKinley name from federal nomenclature, an affront to President McKinley’s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice. \nThis order honors President McKinley for giving his life for our great Nation \nand dutifully recognizes his historic legacy of protecting America’s interests and generating enormous wealth for all Americans. \n(b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior \nshall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, reinstate the name ‘‘Mount McKinley.’’ The Secretary shall subsequently update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:42 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\31JAE1.SGM 31JAE1ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E1\n8630 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 20 / Friday, January 31, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nMount McKinley. The national park area surrounding Mount McKinley shall \nretain the name Denali National Park and Preserve. \n(c) The Secretary of the Interior shall work with Alaska Native entities \nand state and local organizations to adopt names for landmarks to honor the history and culture of the Alaskan people. \nSec. 4. Gulf of America. (a) The area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico \nhas long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has \nremained an indelible part of America. The Gulf was a crucial artery for America’s early trade and global commerce. It is the largest gulf in the world, and the United States coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres. Its natural resources and wildlife remain central to America’s economy today. The bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our Nation’s crude-oil production and an abundance of natural gas, and consistently driving new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world. The Gulf is also home to vibrant American fisheries teeming with snapper, shrimp, grouper, stone crab, and other species, and it is recognized as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with the second largest volume of commercial fishing landings by region in the Nation, contributing millions of dollars to local American economies. The Gulf is also a favorite destination for American tourism and recreation activities. Further, the Gulf is a vital region for the multi-billion-dollar U.S. maritime industry, providing some of the largest and most impressive ports in the world. The Gulf will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping America’s future and the global economy, and in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our Nation’s economy and its people, I am directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America. \n(b) As such, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary \nof the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, take all appropriate actions to rename as the ‘‘Gulf of America’’ the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of Mexico. The Secretary shall subsequently update the GNIS to reflect the renaming of the Gulf and remove all references to the Gulf of Mexico from the GNIS, consistent with applicable law. The Board shall provide guidance to ensure all federal references to the Gulf of America, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communica-tions shall reflect its renaming. \nSec. 5. Additional Action. The Secretary of Interior may solicit public and \nintergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor, particularly \nin light of America’s semiquincentennial celebration, and shall recommend action to me, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. \nSec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed \nto impair or otherwise affect: \n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, \nor the head thereof; or \n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. \n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and \nsubject to the availability of appropriations. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:42 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\31JAE1.SGM 31JAE1ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E1\n8631 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 20 / Friday, January 31, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, \nsubstantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party \nagainst the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. \nTHE WHITE HOUSE, \nJanuary 20, 2025. \n[FR Doc. 2025–02096 \nFiled 1–30–25; 8:45 am] \nBilling code 3395–F4–P \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:42 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\31JAE1.SGM 31JAE1\nTrump.EPS</GPH>ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E1",

(INA), it is hereby ordered as follows: \nSection 1. Purpose. This order sets in motion a process by which Ansar \nAllah, also known as the Houthis, shall be considered for designation as \na Foreign Terrorist Organization, consistent with section 219 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1189). \nSupported by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC– \nQF), which arms and trains terrorist organizations worldwide, the Houthis have fired at U.S. Navy warships dozens of times since 2023, endangering American men and women in uniform. Since seizing most Yemeni population centers by force from the legitimate Yemeni government in 2014–2015, the Houthis have launched numerous attacks on civilian infrastructure, including multiple attacks on civilian airports in Saudi Arabia, the deadly January 2022 attacks on the United Arab Emirates, and more than 300 projectiles fired at Israel since October 2023. The Houthis have also attacked commercial vessels transiting Bab al-Mandeb more than 100 times, killing at least four civilian sailors and forcing some Red Sea maritime commercial traffic to reroute, which has contributed to global inflation. \nThe Houthis’ activities threaten the security of American civilians and per-\nsonnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to cooperate with its \nregional partners to eliminate Ansar Allah’s capabilities and operations, \ndeprive it of resources, and thereby end its attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea. \nSec. 3. Implementation. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the \nSecretary of State shall, after consultation with the Director of National \nIntelligence and the Secretary of the Treasury, submit a report to the Presi-dent, through the National Security Council, concerning the designation of Ansar Allah as a foreign terrorist organization consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189. \n(b) Within 15 days after submitting the report required under subsection \n(a) of this section, the Secretary of State shall take all appropriate action, consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189, with regard to a designation of Ansar Allah as a terrorist organization. \n(c) Following any designation of Ansar Allah as a foreign terrorist organiza-\ntion under 8 U.S.C. 1189, the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) shall jointly conduct a review of the United Nations partners, nongovernmental organizations, and contractors through which USAID works in Yemen, and identify any entities with a relationship with USAID that have: \n(i) made payments to members of, or governmental entities controlled by, Ansar Allah; or \n(ii) criticized international efforts to counter Ansar Allah while failing \nto document Ansar Allah’s abuses sufficiently. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:54 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\31JAE4.SGM 31JAE4ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E4\n8640 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 20 / Friday, January 31, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(d) The Administrator of USAID shall take all appropriate action to termi-\nnate the projects, grants, or contracts identified under subsection (c) of \nthis section as appropriate. \nSec. 4.

Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: \nSection 1. Policy and Purpose. More than 50 years after the assassinations \nof President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Federal Government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events. Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth. It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay. \nThe President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of \n1992 required all records related to the assassination of President Kennedy to be publicly disclosed in full by October 26, 2017, unless the President certifies that: (i) continued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations; and (ii) the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure. President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, section 5(g)(2)(D), Public Law 102–526, 106 Stat. 3443, 3448–49, codified at 44 U.S.C. 2107 note. \nI previously accepted proposed redactions from executive departments and \nagencies (agencies) in 2017 and 2018, but ordered the continued re-evaluation of those remaining redactions. See Temporary Certification for Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 82 FR 50,307–08 (Oct. 31, 2017); Certification for Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 83 FR 19, 157–58 (Apr. 26, 2018). In the Presidential Memorandum of April 26, 2018, I also ordered agencies to re-review each of those redactions over the next 3 years and disclose information that no longer warrants continued withholding under the standard set forth in section 5(g)(2)(D) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. \nPresident Biden issued subsequent certifications with respect to these records \nin 2021, 2022, and 2023, which gave agencies additional time to review the records and withhold information from public disclosure. See Temporary Certification Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 86 FR 59,599 (Oct. 22, 2021); Certifications Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 87 FR 77,967 (Dec. 15, 2022); Certification Regarding Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 88 FR 43,247 (June 30, 2023). \nI have now determined that the continued redaction and withholding of \ninformation from records pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is not consistent with the public interest and the release of these records is long overdue. And although no Act of Congress directs the release of information pertaining to the assassinations of Senator Robert F.

Purpose and Policy. The Federal responses to Hurricane Helene \nand other recent disasters demonstrate the need to drastically improve the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency’s (‘‘FEMA’s’’) efficacy, priorities, and competence, including evaluating whether FEMA’s bureaucracy in dis-aster response ultimately harms the agency’s ability to successfully respond. Despite obligating nearly $30 billion in disaster aid each of the past three years, FEMA has managed to leave vulnerable Americans without the re-sources or support they need when they need it most. \nThere are serious concerns of political bias in FEMA. Indeed, at least one \nformer FEMA responder has stated that FEMA managers directed her to avoid homes of individuals supporting the campaign of Donald J. Trump for President. And it has lost mission focus, diverting limited staff and resources to support missions beyond its scope and authority, spending well over a billion dollars to welcome illegal aliens. \nAmericans deserve an immediate, effective, and impartial response to and \nrecovery from disasters. FEMA therefore requires a full-scale review, by individuals highly experienced at effective disaster response and recovery, who shall recommend to the President improvements or structural changes to promote the national interest and enable national resilience. \nSec. 2. Establishment. (a) There is hereby established the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency Review Council (‘‘Council’’). \n(b) The Council shall be composed of not more than 20 members. The \nSecretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Defense shall be mem-\nbers of the Council. The remaining members shall include relevant agency heads and distinguished individuals and representatives from sectors outside of the Federal Government appointed by the President. These non-Federal members shall have diverse perspectives and expertise in disaster relief and assistance, emergency preparedness, natural disasters, Federal-State rela-tionships, and budget management. \n(c) The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Defense \nshall serve as Co-Chairs of the Council. The Co-Chairs may designate up to two Vice Chairs of the Council from among the non-Federal members of the Council, to support the Co-Chairs in the leadership and organization of the Council. \nSec. 3.

Agencies must report on measures within 15 days, aiming to prevent future disasters and support recovery efforts in affected communities.",

Policy. For weeks, residents of the Los Angeles area have watched \nraging fires consume their homes, belongings, beloved pets, and childhood \nmemories. Almost immediately, firefighters were unable to fight the blaze due to dry hydrants, empty reservoirs, and inadequate water infrastructure. Today, at least 28 people have lost their lives and thousands more have lost everything else, with some damage estimates calculating hundreds of billions of dollars in damage. \nThis tragedy affects the entire Nation, so it is in the Nation’s interest to \nensure that California has what it needs to prevent and fight these fires and others in the future. Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to provide Southern California with necessary water resources, notwith-standing actively harmful State or local policies. And it is the policy of the United States to assist Americans in disaster areas through responsive policies that more effectively empower them to rebuild and regain their livelihoods. \nSec. 2. Overriding Disastrous California Policies. (a) The Secretary of Defense, \nthe Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary \nof Commerce, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Agriculture shall expeditiously take all measures, consistent with all applicable authori-ties, to ensure adequate water resources in Southern California. Each shall report to me within 15 days on all authorities, including emergency authori-ties, available to ensure, require, maintain, or use infrastructure necessary to fight and prevent massive wildfires in Southern California. \n(b) In particular, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce \nshall immediately take actions to override existing activities that unduly burden efforts to maximize water deliveries. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall consider actions including those con-sistent with the ‘‘No Action Alternative’’ in the Final Environmental Impact Statement issued November 15, 2024, by the Bureau of Reclamation on Long-term Operation of the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. \n(c) The Secretary of the Interior, including through the Bureau of Reclama-\ntion, shall utilize his discretion to operate the CVP to deliver more water and produce additional hydropower, including by increasing storage and conveyance, and jointly operating federal and state facilities, to high-need communities, notwithstanding any contrary State or local laws. The Bureau of Reclamation shall take all available measures to ensure that State agen-cies—including the California Department of Water Resources—do not inter-fere with the Bureau of Reclamation’s operation of the project to maximize water delivery to high-need communities or otherwise, including but not \nlimited to the issuance of a new Record of Decision maximizing water deliveries and consistent with the 2020 Record of Decision. \n(d) In accordance with section 6 of the Executive Order of January 20, \n2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), the Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation, and in accordance with section 1536 of title 16 United States Code, shall expedite action related to any exemption under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq., \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:45 Jan 30, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\31JAE10.SGM 31JAE10ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E10\n8748 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 20 / Friday, January 31, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nfor the Long-Term Operation of the CVP and the State Water Project for \nall applicable threatened and endangered species. \n(e) The Secretary of the Interior shall promptly review, revise, or rescind \nany regulations or procedures specific to implementation of section 1536 of title 16 United States Code, as needed and consistent with applicable law, to conform with the plain meaning of the statute. \n(f) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall \nidentify all ongoing or potential major water-supply and storage projects within the State of California for which they have joint responsibility under the ESA or individual responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. \n(g) For each such project identified under subsection (f), the Secretary \nof the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall each designate one federal official to coordinate each agency’s respective NEPA and ESA compli-ance responsibilities. Within 30 days from the date of this order, each designated official shall identify any regulatory hurdles that unduly burden each respective water project, identify any recent changes in state or Federal law that may impact such projects from a regulatory perspective (including Public Law 118–5), and shall develop a proposed plan, for review by the Secretaries, to appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind any regulations or procedures that unduly burden such projects and are not necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law. In so doing, each designated federal official will coordinate and share all appropriate informa-tion that will enable improved efficiencies. For the purposes of this order, ‘‘unduly burden’’ means to unnecessarily obstruct, delay, curtail, impede or otherwise impose significant costs on the permitting, utilization, trans-mission, delivery, or supply of water resources and water infrastructure. \nSec. 3. Ending the Subsidization of California’s Mismanagement. (a) The \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall review all \nFederal programs, projects, and activities for all relevant agencies that impact land management, water availability, water supply, water storage and deliv-ery, water infrastructure, and disaster preparedness and response. \n(b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, to ensure that State and \nlocal jurisdictions promote sensible land management practices and reliable water supply for all Americans, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, regarding California State and local policies or practices inconsistent with sound disaster prevention and response. \n(c) The Director of OMB, in consultation with the Assistant to the President \nfor Domestic Policy and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall recommend appropriate action to the President, regarding: \n(i) any lack of compliance by California with the terms of existing Federal grants, contracts, or other financial assistance to States or localities; and \n(ii) beneficial additional terms that may be added with respect to any \nfuture Federal programs, projects, or activities to ensure sound disaster prevention and response. \nSec. 4. Additional Actions to Help Los Angeles Families. (a) Housing Dis-\nplaced Families. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Administrator of FEMA, shall expeditiously provide an Integrated Federal Housing Strategy and Imple-mentation Plan to the Director of OMB and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that expedites options for housing relief to survivors displaced by wildfires in California. \n(b) Expediting Waste Removal.

The Secretary \nof Homeland Security, through the Administrator of FEMA, shall immediately implement a plan to enable the timely and appropriate use of Federal preparedness grants for the City of Los Angeles. As of the date of this order, the city has yet to use the majority of its $213 million allotment that has accrued since fiscal year 2021. These Federal preparedness grants shall not be used to support illegal aliens. The Attorney General, in coordina-tion with the FEMA Administrator, shall investigate the misuse of these grants by the City of Los Angeles and take appropriate action to address such misuse. \nSec. 5. Additional Actions to Help North Carolina Families. (a) Clearing \nRoads. To accelerate rebuilding and community recovery, the Secretary of \nTransportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Ad-ministrator of FEMA, and the Administrator of the Small Business Adminis-tration shall immediately take all necessary and appropriate measures, includ-ing through direct assistance, loans, and other available means, to expedite roadway clearance or rebuilding, including the section of Interstate 40 in North Carolina that remains closed, and the repair or rebuilding of roads and bridges on private property in areas of North Carolina affected by Hurricane Helene. \n(b) Housing Displaced Families. The Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Adminis-trator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall immediately provide an Integrated Federal Housing Strategy and Implementation Plan to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that expedites options for housing relief to survivors displaced by Hurricane Helene. \nSec. 6. General Provisions.

The order mandates that agencies enforce sex-based distinctions, restricts the use of gender ideology in federal documents, and ensures privacy in women’s spaces. Agencies must provide guidance within 30 days and submit implementation updates within 120 days. This order aims to protect women’s rights and uphold biological truths in government policy.",
        "date": "2025-01-30",
        "body": "Presidential Documents8615 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nExecutive Order 14168 of January 20, 2025 \nDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Re-\nstoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government \nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States of America, including section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered: \nSection 1. Purpose. Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological \nreality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means \nto permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single- sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women’s domestic abuse shelters to women’s workplace showers. This is wrong. Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system. Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself. \nThis unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against \nthe ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts. Invalidating the true and biological category of ‘‘woman’’ improperly trans-forms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept. \nAccordingly, my Administration will defend women’s rights and protect \nfreedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male. \nSec. 2. Policy and Definitions. It is the policy of the United States to \nrecognize two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and \nare grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Under my direc-tion, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpre-tation of and application of Federal law and administration policy: \n(a) ‘‘Sex’’ shall refer to an individual’s immutable biological classification \nas either male or female. ‘‘Sex’’ is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of ‘‘gender identity.’’ \n(b) ‘‘Women’’ or ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘girls’’ or ‘‘girl’’ shall mean adult and \njuvenile human females, respectively. \n(c) ‘‘Men’’ or ‘‘man’’ and ‘‘boys’’ or ‘‘boy’’ shall mean adult and juvenile \nhuman males, respectively. \n(d) ‘‘Female’’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that \nproduces the large reproductive cell. \n(e) ‘‘Male’’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that pro-\nduces the small reproductive cell. \n(f) ‘‘Gender ideology’’ replaces the biological category of sex with an \never-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:43 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE7.SGM 30JAE7lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC13\n8616 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nGender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders \nthat are disconnected from one’s sex. Gender ideology is internally incon-sistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body. \n(g) ‘‘Gender identity’’ reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of \nself, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex. \nSec. 3. Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men. (a) Within \n30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order. \n(b) Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing \nsex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. Each agency should therefore give the terms ‘‘sex’’, ‘‘male’’, ‘‘female’’, ‘‘men’’, ‘‘women’’, ‘‘boys’’ and ‘‘girls’’ the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications. \n(c) When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency \nand all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term ‘‘sex’’ and not ‘‘gender’’ in all applicable Federal policies and documents. \n(d) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director \nof the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder’s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Manage-ment shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees’ sex, as defined by section 2 of this order. \n(e) Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, com-\nmunications, or other internal and external messages that promote or other-wise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. Agency forms that require an individual’s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity. Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. \n(f) The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court’s decision \nin Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single- sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act. This position is legally untenable and has harmed women. The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities. In addition, \nthe Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent. \n(g) Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each \nagency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. \nSec. 4. Privacy in Intimate Spaces. (a) The Attorney General and Secretary \nof Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women’s \nprisons or housed in women’s detention centers, including through amend-ment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:43 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE7.SGM 30JAE7lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC13\n8617 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(b) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall prepare and \nsubmit for notice and comment rulemaking a policy to rescind the final \nrule entitled ‘‘Equal Access in Accordance with an Individual’s Gender Identity in Community Planning and Development Programs’’ of September 21, 2016, 81 FR 64763, and shall submit for public comment a policy protecting women seeking single-sex rape shelters. \n(c) The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises \nits policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex. \n(d) Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to \nensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity. \nSec. 5.

Purpose. Over the last 4 years, the United States has been inun-\ndated with record levels of migration, including through the U.S. Refugee \nAdmissions Program (USRAP). Cities and small towns alike, from Charleroi, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Ohio, to Whitewater, Wisconsin, have seen significant influxes of migrants. Even major urban centers such as New York City, Chicago, and Denver have sought Federal aid to manage the burden of new arrivals. Some jurisdictions, like New York and Massachusetts, have even recently declared states of emergency because of increased migra-tion. \nThe United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, \nand in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees. This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to ensure that public \nsafety and national security are paramount considerations in the administra-\ntion of the USRAP, and to admit only those refugees who can fully and appropriately assimilate into the United States and to ensure that the United States preserves taxpayer resources for its citizens. It is also the policy of the United States that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. \nSec. 3. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. (a) I hereby \nproclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) \nand 1185(a), that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore direct that entry into the United States of refugees under the USRAP be suspended— subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (c) of this section—until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order. This suspension shall take effect at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 27, 2025. \n(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applica-\ntions for refugee status, until a finding is made in accordance with section 4 of this order. \n(c) Notwithstanding the suspension of the USRAP imposed pursuant to \nsubsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit aliens to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such aliens as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:50 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE2.SGM 30JAE2lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC2\n8460 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(d) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney \nGeneral, shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, con-\nsistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement. In all cases, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure that the State and local consultation requirements in 8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(2) are carried out with respect to all refugees admitted to the United States. \nSec. 4. Resumption of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Within 90 \ndays of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, shall submit a report to the President through the Homeland Security Advisor regarding whether resumption of entry of refugees into the United States under the USRAP would be in the interests of the United States, in light of the policies outlined in section 2 of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit further reports every 90 days thereafter until I determine that resumption of the USRAP is in the interests of the United States. \nSec. 5. Revocation. Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding \nand Enhancing Programs To Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact \nof Climate Change on Migration), is hereby revoked. \nSec. 6. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of \nany provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the \nremainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. \nSec. 7. General Provisions.

The United States’ successful track record of advancing both economic and environmental objectives should be a model for other countries. \nIn recent years, the United States has purported to join international agree-\nments and initiatives that do not reflect our country’s values or our contribu-tions to the pursuit of economic and environmental objectives. Moreover, these agreements steer American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of my Administration to put the interests \nof the United States and the American people first in the development \nand negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy. These agreements must not unduly or unfairly burden the United States. \nSec. 3. Implementation. (a) The United States Ambassador to the United \nNations shall immediately submit formal written notification of the United \nStates’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The notice shall be submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Depositary of the Agree-ment, attached as Appendix A. The United States will consider its withdrawal from the Agreement and any attendant obligations to be effective immediately upon this provision of notification. \n(b) The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall immediately \nsubmit written formal notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, or any relevant party, of the United States’ withdrawal from any agreement, pact, accord, or similar commitment made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n(c) The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collaboration \nwith the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, shall immediately cease or revoke any purported financial commitment made by the United States under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n(d) Immediately upon completion of the tasks listed in subsections (a), \n(b), and (c), the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collabora-tion with the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury shall certify a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that describes in detail any further action required to achieve the policy objectives set forth in section 2 of this order. \n(e) The U.S. International Climate Finance Plan is revoked and rescinded \nimmediately.

Purpose. Capital punishment is an essential tool for deterring \nand punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes and acts \nof lethal violence against American citizens. Before, during, and after the founding of the United States, our cities, States, and country have continu-ously relied upon capital punishment as the ultimate deterrent and only proper punishment for the vilest crimes. Our Founders knew well that only capital punishment can bring justice and restore order in response to such evil. For this and other reasons, capital punishment continues to enjoy broad popular support. \nYet for too long, politicians and judges who oppose capital punishment \nhave defied and subverted the laws of our country. At every turn, they seek to thwart the execution of lawfully imposed capital sentences and choose to enforce their personal beliefs rather than the law. When President Biden took office in 2021, he allowed his Department of Justice to issue a moratorium on Federal executions, in defiance of his duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United States that provide for capital punishment. And on December 23, 2024, President Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 most vile and sadistic rapists, child molesters, and murderers on Federal death row: remorseless criminals who brutalized young children, strangled and drowned their victims, and hunted strangers for sport. He commuted their sentences even though the laws of our Nation have always protected victims by applying capital punishment to barbaric acts like theirs. Judges who oppose capital punishment have likewise disregarded the law by falsely claiming that capital punishment is unconstitutional, even though the Constitution explicitly acknowledges the legality of capital punishment. \nThese efforts to subvert and undermine capital punishment defy the laws \nof our nation, make a mockery of justice, and insult the victims of these horrible crimes. The Government’s most solemn responsibility is to protect its citizens from abhorrent acts, and my Administration will not tolerate efforts to stymie and eviscerate the laws that authorize capital punishment against those who commit horrible acts of violence against American citizens. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to ensure that the \nlaws that authorize capital punishment are respected and faithfully imple-\nmented, and to counteract the politicians and judges who subvert the law by obstructing and preventing the execution of capital sentences. \nSec. 3. Federal Capital Punishment. (a) The Attorney General shall pursue \nthe death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use. \n(b) In addition to pursuing the death penalty where possible, the Attorney \nGeneral shall, where consistent with applicable law, pursue Federal jurisdic-\ntion and seek the death penalty regardless of other factors for every federal capital crime involving: \n(i) The murder of a law-enforcement officer; or \n(ii) A capital crime committed by an alien illegally present in this country. \nThe Attorney General shall encourage State attorneys general and district \nattorneys to bring State capital charges for all capital crimes with special \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:54 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE3.SGM 30JAE3lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC3\n8464 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nattention to the crimes described in Subsections (i) and (ii), regardless of \nwhether the federal trial results in a capital sentence. \n(d) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to modify the \nJustice Manual based on the policy and purpose set forth in this Executive Order. \n(e) The Attorney General shall evaluate the places of imprisonment and \nconditions of confinement for each of the 37 murderers whose Federal death sentences were commuted by President Biden, and the Attorney Gen-eral shall take all lawful and appropriate action to ensure that these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose. The Attorney General shall further evaluate wheth-er these offenders can be charged with State capital crimes and shall rec-ommend appropriate action to state and local authorities. \nSec. 4. Preserving Capital Punishment in the States. (a) The Attorney General \nshall take all necessary and lawful action to ensure that each state that \nallows capital punishment has a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection. \n(b) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to approve \nor deny any pending request for certification made by any State under 28 U.S.C. 2265. \nSec. 5. Seeking The Overruling of Supreme Court Precedents That Hinder \nCapital Punishment. The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action \nto seek the overruling of Supreme Court precedents that limit the authority of State and Federal governments to impose capital punishment. \nSec. 6. Prosecuting Crime to Protect Communities. (a) The Attorney General \nshall appropriately prioritize public safety and the prosecution of violent \ncrime, and take all appropriate action necessary to dismantle transnational criminal activity in the United States. \n(b) To ensure the fullest protection of American communities from vio-\nlence, the Attorney General shall encourage state attorneys general and dis-trict attorneys to adopt policies and practices aligned with subsection (a). Federal law enforcement should coordinate with State and local law enforce-ment where possible to facilitate these objectives. \nSec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed \nto impair or otherwise affect: \n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, \nor the head thereof; or \n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. \n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and \nsubject to the availability of appropriations. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:54 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE3.SGM 30JAE3lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC3\n8465 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, \nsubstantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party \nagainst the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. \nTHE WHITE HOUSE, \nJanuary 20, 2025. \n[FR Doc. 2025–02012 \nFiled 1–29–25; 8:45 am] \nBilling code 3395–F4–P \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:54 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE3.SGM 30JAE3\nTrump.EPS</GPH>lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC3",

Purpose. Over the last 4 years, the United States has endured \na large-scale invasion at an unprecedented level. Millions of illegal aliens \nfrom nations and regions all around the world successfully entered the United States where they are now residing, including potential terrorists, foreign spies, members of cartels, gangs, and violent transnational criminal organizations, and other hostile actors with malicious intent. \nDeadly narcotics and other illicit materials have flowed across the border \nwhile agents and officers spend their limited resources processing illegal aliens for release into the United States. These catch-and-release policies undermine the rule of law and our sovereignty, create substantial risks to public safety and security, and divert critical resources away from stopping the entry of contraband and fugitives into the United States. \nWe have limited information on the precise whereabouts of a great number \nof these illegal aliens who have entered the United States over the last 4 years. \nThis cannot stand. A nation without borders is not a nation, and the Federal \nGovernment must act with urgency and strength to end the threats posed by an unsecured border. \nOne of my most important obligations is to protect the American people \nfrom the disastrous effects of unlawful mass migration and resettlement. \nMy Administration will marshal all available resources and authorities to \nstop this unprecedented flood of illegal aliens into the United States. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to take all appropriate \naction to secure the borders of our Nation through the following means: \n(a) Establishing a physical wall and other barriers monitored and supported \nby adequate personnel and technology; \n(b) Deterring and preventing the entry of illegal aliens into the United \nStates; \n(c) Detaining, to the maximum extent authorized by law, aliens appre-\nhended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, until such time \nas they are removed from the United States; \n(d) Removing promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of \nFederal law; \n(e) Pursuing criminal charges against illegal aliens who violate the immigra-\ntion laws, and against those who facilitate their unlawful presence in the United States; \n(f) Cooperating fully with State and local law enforcement officials in \nenacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities; and \n(g) Obtaining complete operational control of the borders of the United \nStates. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:55 Jan 29, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\30JAE4.SGM 30JAE4lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC4\n8468 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 19 / Thursday, January 30, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nSec. 3.

The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, issue new policy guidance or propose regulations regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as ‘‘catch-and-release,’’ whereby illegal aliens are routinely released into the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law. \nSec. 6. Resumption of Migrant Protection Protocols. As soon as practicable, \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary \nof State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to resume the Migrant Protection Protocols in all sectors along the southern border of the United States and ensure that, pending removal proceedings, aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came. \nSec. 7. Adjusting Parole Policies. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, \nconsistent with applicable law, take all appropriate action to: \n(a) Cease using the ‘‘CBP One’’ application as a method of paroling or \nfacilitating the entry of otherwise inadmissible aliens into the United States; \n(b) Terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the \npolicies of the United States established in my Executive Orders, including \nthe program known as the ‘‘Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.’’ \n(c) Align all policies and operations at the southern border of the United \nStates to be consistent with the policy of Section 2 of this order and ensure that all future parole determinations fully comply with this order and with applicable law. \nSec. 8.

Policy. The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Con-\ntrolled Applications Act (the ‘‘Act’’) (Pub. L. 118–50, div. H) regulates ‘‘for-\neign adversary controlled applications,’’ specifically those operated by TikTok and any other subsidiary of its China-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., on national security grounds. \nSection 2(a) of the Act prohibits entities from distributing, maintaining, \nor updating certain defined foreign adversary controlled applications within the territory of the United States by providing (A) services for such distribu-tion, maintenance, or updates by means of an online mobile application store or other marketplace; or (B) internet hosting services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such applications. Section 2(g) of the Act defines ‘‘Foreign Adversary Controlled Application’’ to include websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, and augmented or immersive technology applications operated directly or indirectly by ByteDance Ltd. or TikTok. Under section 2(a) of the Act, the prohibitions of the Act with respect to these entities became effective on January 19, 2025. \nI have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of \nthe United States, the conduct of foreign policy, and other vital executive functions. To fulfill those responsibilities, I intend to consult with my advi-sors, including the heads of relevant departments and agencies on the na-tional security concerns posed by TikTok, and to pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans. My Administration must also review sensitive intelligence related to those concerns and evaluate the sufficiency of mitigation measures TikTok \nhas taken to date. \nThe unfortunate timing of section 2(a) of the Act—one day before I took \noffice as the 47th President of the United States—interferes with my ability to assess the national security and foreign policy implications of the Act’s prohibitions before they take effect. This timing also interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns. Accordingly, I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans. \nSec. 2. Action. (a) I hereby order the Attorney General not to take any \naction on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 75 days from \nthe date of this order, to permit my Administration an opportunity to deter-mine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok. During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating) of any foreign adversary con-trolled application as defined in the Act.

The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive’s exclusive authority to enforce the Act. \nSec. 3. General Provisions.

(a) As Chief Executive and as Commander in Chief \nof the Armed Forces of the United States, I have no more solemn responsi-\nbility than protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the United States along our national borders. The protection of a nation’s territorial integrity and national boundaries is paramount for its security. \n(b) The Armed Forces of the United States have played a long and well- \nestablished role in securing our borders against threats of invasion, against unlawful forays by foreign nationals into the United States, and against other transnational criminal activities that violate our laws and threaten the peace, harmony, and tranquility of the Nation. These threats have taken a variety of forms over our Nation’s history, but the Armed Forces have consistently played an integral role in protecting the sovereignty of the United States. \n(c) Threats against our Nation’s sovereignty continue today, and it is \nessential that the Armed Forces staunchly continue to participate in the defense of our territorial integrity and sovereignty.

Purpose. The United States noticed its withdrawal from the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) in 2020 due to the organization’s mishandling \nof the COVID–19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influ-ence of WHO member states. In addition, the WHO continues to demand unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries’ assessed payments. China, with a population of 1.4 billion, has 300 percent of the population of the United States, yet contributes nearly 90 percent less to the WHO. \nSec. 2. Actions. (a) The United States intends to withdraw from the WHO. \nThe Presidential Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations signed \non January 20, 2021, that retracted the United States’ July 6, 2020, notification of withdrawal is revoked. \n(b) Executive Order 13987 of January 25, 2021 (Organizing and Mobilizing \nthe United States Government to Provide a Unified and Effective Response to Combat COVID–19 and to Provide United States Leadership on Global Health and Security), is revoked. \n(c) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs shall estab-\nlish directorates and coordinating mechanisms within the National Security Council apparatus as he deems necessary and appropriate to safeguard public health and fortify biosecurity. \n(d) The Secretary of State and the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget shall take appropriate measures, with all practicable speed, to: \n(i) pause the future transfer of any United States Government funds, sup-port, or resources to the WHO; \n(ii) recall and reassign United States Government personnel or contractors \nworking in any capacity with the WHO; and \n(iii) identify credible and transparent United States and international part-\nners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO. \n(e) The Director of the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness \nand Response Policy shall review, rescind, and replace the 2024 U.S. Global \nHealth Security Strategy as soon as practicable. \nSec. 3. Notification. The Secretary of State shall immediately inform the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, any other applicable depositary, \nand the leadership of the WHO of the withdrawal. \nSec. 4. Global System Negotiations. While withdrawal is in progress, the \nSecretary of State will cease negotiations on the WHO Pandemic Agreement \nand the amendments to the International Health Regulations, and actions taken to effectuate such agreement and amendments will have no binding force on the United States. \nSec. 5.

Background. America is blessed with an abundance of energy \nand natural resources that have historically powered our Nation’s economic \nprosperity. In recent years, burdensome and ideologically motivated regula-tions have impeded the development of these resources, limited the genera-tion of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens. These high energy costs devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utili-ties, farming, and manufacturing, while weakening our national security. \nIt is thus in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable \nenergy and natural resources. This will restore American prosperity—includ-ing for those men and women who have been forgotten by our economy in recent years. It will also rebuild our Nation’s economic and military security, which will deliver peace through strength. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States: \n(a) to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and \nwaters, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to meet the \nneeds of our citizens and solidify the United States as a global energy leader long into the future; \n(b) to establish our position as the leading producer and processor of \nnon-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states; \n(c) to protect the United States’s economic and national security and \nmilitary preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation; \n(d) to ensure that all regulatory requirements related to energy are grounded \nin clearly applicable law; \n(e) to eliminate the ‘‘electric vehicle (EV) mandate’’ and promote true \nconsumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles; by terminating, where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable; \n(f) to safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a variety \nof goods and appliances, including but not limited to lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water heaters, toilets, and shower heads, and to promote market competition and innovation within the manufacturing and appliance industries; \n(g) to ensure that the global effects of a rule, regulation, or action shall, \nwhenever evaluated, be reported separately from its domestic costs and \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOC8\n8354 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nbenefits, in order to promote sound regulatory decision making and prioritize \nthe interests of the American people; \n(h) to guarantee that all executive departments and agencies (agencies) \nprovide opportunity for public comment and rigorous, peer-reviewed sci-entific analysis; and \n(i) to ensure that no Federal funding be employed in a manner contrary \nto the principles outlined in this section, unless required by law. \nSec. 3. Immediate Review of All Agency Actions that Potentially Burden \nthe Development of Domestic Energy Resources. (a) The heads of all agencies \nshall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and any other agency actions (collectively, agen-cy actions) to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources— with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources—or that are otherwise incon-sistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including restric-tions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances. \n(b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency \nshall, in consultation with the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC), develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome under subsection (a) of this section, as expeditiously as possible and consistent with applicable law. The head of any agency who determines that such agency does not have agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the Director of OMB a written statement to that effect and, absent a determination by the Director of OMB that such agency does have agency actions described in this subsection, shall have no further responsibilities under this section. \n(c) Agencies shall promptly notify the Attorney General of any steps \ntaken pursuant to subsection (a) of this section so that the Attorney General may, as appropriate: \n(i) provide notice of this Executive Order and any such actions to any court with jurisdiction over pending litigation in which such actions may be relevant; and \n(ii) request that such court stay or otherwise delay further litigation, or \nseek other appropriate relief consistent with this order, pending the com-pletion of the administrative actions described in this order. \n(d) Pursuant to the policy outlined in section 2 of this order, the Attorney \nGeneral shall consider whether pending litigation against illegal, dangerous, \nor harmful policies should be resolved through stays or other relief. \nSec. 4. Revocation of and Revisions to Certain Presidential and Regulatory \nActions. (a) The following are revoked and any offices established therein \nare abolished: \n(i) Executive Order 13990 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting Public Health \nand the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis); \n(ii) Executive Order 13992 of January 20, 2021 (Revocation of Certain \nExecutive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation); \n(iii) Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the Climate \nCrisis at Home and Abroad); \n(iv) Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s Council of \nAdvisors on Science and Technology); \n(v) Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing \nPrograms to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration); \n(vi) Executive Order 14027 of May 7, 2021 (Establishment of the Climate \nChange Support Office); \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOC8\n8355 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(vii) Executive Order 14030 of May 20, 2021 (Climate-Related Financial \nRisk); \n(viii) Executive Order 14037 of August 5, 2021 (Strengthening American \nLeadership in Clean Cars and Trucks); \n(ix) Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy \nIndustries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability); \n(x) Executive Order 14072 of April 22, 2022 (Strengthening the Nation’s \nForests, Communities, and Local Economies); \n(xi) Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of \nthe Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022); and \n(xii) Executive Order 14096 of April 21, 2023 (Revitalizing Our Nation’s \nCommitment to Environmental Justice for All). \n(b) All activities, programs, and operations associated with the American \nClimate Corps, including actions taken by any agency shall be terminated \nimmediately. Within one day of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a letter to all parties to the ‘‘American Climate Corps Memorandum of Understanding’’ dated December 2023 to terminate the memorandum, and the head of each party to the memorandum shall agree to the termination in writing. \n(c) Any assets, funds, or resources allocated to an entity or program \nabolished by subsection (a) of this section shall be redirected or disposed of in accordance with applicable law. \n(d) The head of any agency that has taken action respecting offices and \nprograms in subsection (a) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all such actions are terminated or, if necessary, appropriate, or required by law, that such activities are transitioned to other agencies or entities. \n(e) Any contract or agreement between the United States and any third \nparty on behalf of the entities or programs abolished in subsection (a) of this section, or in furtherance of them, shall be terminated for convenience, or otherwise, as quickly as permissible under the law. \nSec. 5. Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting. (a) Execu-\ntive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (Relating to protection and enhancement \nof environmental quality) is hereby revoked. \n(b) To expedite and simplify the permitting process, within 30 days of \nthe date of this order, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall provide guidance on implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and propose rescinding CEQ’s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq. \n(c) Following the provision of the guidance, the Chairman of CEQ shall \nconvene a working group to coordinate the revision of agency-level imple-menting regulations for consistency. The guidance in subsection (b) and any resulting implementing regulations must expedite permitting approvals and meet deadlines established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118–5). Consistent with applicable law, all agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives, including those of activist groups, that do not align with the policy goals set forth in section 2 of this order or that could otherwise add delays and ambiguity to the permitting process. \n(d) The Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing \nand Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Chairman of CEQ, and the heads of any other relevant agencies shall undertake all available efforts to eliminate all delays within their respective permitting processes, including through, but not limited to, the use of general permitting and permit by rule.

Agencies shall work closely with project sponsors to realize the ultimate construction or development of permitted projects. \n(e) The Director of the NEC and the Director of the Office of Legislative \nAffairs shall jointly prepare recommendations to Congress, which shall: \n(i) facilitate the permitting and construction of interstate energy transpor-tation and other critical energy infrastructure, including, but not limited to, pipelines, particularly in regions of the Nation that have lacked such development in recent years; and \n(ii) provide greater certainty in the Federal permitting process, including, \nbut not limited to, streamlining the judicial review of the application of NEPA. \nSec. 6. Prioritizing Accuracy in Environmental Analyses. (a) In all Federal \npermitting adjudications or regulatory processes, all agencies shall adhere to only the relevant legislated requirements for environmental considerations and any considerations beyond these requirements are eliminated. In ful-filling all such requirements, agencies shall strictly use the most robust methodologies of assessment at their disposal and shall not use methodolo-gies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated. \n(b) The Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse \nGases (IWG), which was established pursuant to Executive Order 13990, is hereby disbanded, and any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy including: \n(i) the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021 (Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policy-making); \n(ii) the Report of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Inter-\nagency Working Group of November 2023 (National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Informa-tion System); \n(iii) the Technical Support Document of February 2021 (Social Cost of \nCarbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990); and \n(iv) estimates of the social cost of greenhouse gases, including the estimates \nfor the social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, or the social cost of nitrous oxide based, in whole or in part, on the IWG’s work or guidance. \n(c) The calculation of the ‘‘social cost of carbon’’ is marked by logical \ndeficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence \nof a foundation in legislation. Its abuse arbitrarily slows regulatory decisions and, by rendering the United States economy internationally uncompetitive, encourages a greater human impact on the environment by affording less efficient foreign energy producers a greater share of the global energy and natural resource market. Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the EPA shall issue guidance to address these harmful and detrimental inadequacies, including consideration of eliminating the ‘‘social cost of carbon’’ calculation from any Federal permitting or regu-latory decision. \n(d) Prior to the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, \nagencies shall ensure estimates to assess the value of changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from agency actions, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international effects and evaluating appro-priate discount rates, are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A–4 of September 17, 2003 (Regu-latory Analysis). \n(e) Furthermore, the head of each agency shall, as appropriate and con-\nsistent with applicable law, initiate a process to make such changes to \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOC8\n8357 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nany rule, regulation, policy or action as may be necessary to ensure consist-\nency with the Regulatory Analysis. \n(f) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the \nEPA, in collaboration with the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit joint recommendations to the Director of OMB on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator’s findings, ‘‘Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,’’ Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009). \nSec. 7. Terminating the Green New Deal. (a) All agencies shall immediately \npause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction \nAct of 2022 (Public Law 117–169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117–58), including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and shall review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disburse-ments of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agency heads shall submit a report to the Director of the NEC and Director of OMB that details the findings of this review, including recommendations to enhance their alignment with the policy set forth in section 2. No funds identified in this subsection (a) shall be disbursed by a given agency until the Director of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt. \n(b) When procuring goods and services, making decisions about leases, \nand making other arrangements that result in disbursements of Federal funds, agencies shall prioritize cost-effectiveness, American workers and businesses, and the sensible use of taxpayer money, to the greatest extent. The Director of OMB shall finalize and circulate guidelines to further implement this subsection. \n(c) All agencies shall assess whether enforcement discretion of authorities \nand regulations can be utilized to advance the policy outlined in section 2 of this order. Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall submit a report to the Director of OMB identifying any such instances. \nSec. 8. Protecting America’s National Security. (a) The Secretary of Energy \nis directed restart reviews of applications for approvals of liquified natural \ngas export projects as expeditiously as possible, consistent with applicable law. In assessing the ‘‘Public Interest’’ to be advanced by any particular application, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the economic and employ-ment impacts to the United States and the impact to the security of allies and partners that would result from granting the application. \n(b) With respect to any proposed deepwater port for the export of liquefied \nnatural gas (project) for which a favorable record of decision (ROD) has previously been issued pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (DWPA), 33 U.S.C. 1501 et seq., the Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall, within 30 days of the date of this order and consistent with applicable law, determine whether any refinements to the project pro-posed subsequent to the ROD are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that substantially differ from those associated with the origi-nally-evaluated project so as to present a seriously different picture of the foreseeable adverse environmental consequences (seriously different con-sequences). In making this determination, MARAD shall qualitatively assess any difference in adverse environmental consequences between the project with and without the proposed refinements, including any potential con-sequences not addressed in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which shall be considered adequate under NEPA notwithstanding any revi-sions to NEPA that may have been enacted following the final EIS. MARAD shall submit this determination, together with a detailed justification, to the Secretary of Transportation and to the President. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:04 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE4.SGM 29JAE4khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOC8\n8358 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(c) Pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, if MARAD determines that \nsuch refinements are not likely to result in seriously different consequences, \nit shall include in that determination a description of the refinements to supplement and update the ROD, if necessary and then no later than 30 additional days, he shall issue a DWPA license. \n(d) If MARAD determines, with concurrence from the Secretary of Trans-\nportation, that such proposed refinements are likely to result in seriously different consequences, it shall, within 60 days after submitting such deter-mination, issue an Environmental Assessment (EA) examining such con-sequences and, with respect to all other environmental consequences not changed due to project refinements, shall reaffirm the conclusions of the final EIS.

Purpose. Over the last 4 years, the prior administration invited, \nadministered, and oversaw an unprecedented flood of illegal immigration \ninto the United States. Millions of illegal aliens crossed our borders or were permitted to fly directly into the United States on commercial flights and allowed to settle in American communities, in violation of longstanding Federal laws. \nMany of these aliens unlawfully within the United States present significant \nthreats to national security and public safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans. Others are engaged in hostile activities, including espionage, economic espionage, and preparations for terror-related activities. Many have abused the generosity of the American people, and their presence in the United States has cost taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels. \nEnforcing our Nation’s immigration laws is critically important to the national \nsecurity and public safety of the United States. The American people deserve a Federal Government that puts their interests first and a Government that understands its sacred obligation to prioritize the safety, security, and finan-cial and economic well-being of Americans. \nThis order ensures that the Federal Government protects the American people \nby faithfully executing the immigration laws of the United States. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to faithfully execute \nthe immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens, particu-\nlarly those aliens who threaten the safety or security of the American people.

Faithful Execution of the Immigration Laws.

Purpose and Policy. The Biden Administration forced illegal \nand immoral discrimination programs, going by the name ‘‘diversity, equity, \nand inclusion’’ (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas ranging from airline safety to the military. This was a concerted effort stemming from President Biden’s first day in office, when he issued Executive Order 13985, ‘‘Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Under-served Communities Through the Federal Government.’’ \nPursuant to Executive Order 13985 and follow-on orders, nearly every Federal \nagency and entity submitted ‘‘Equity Action Plans’’ to detail the ways that they have furthered DEIs infiltration of the Federal Government. The public release of these plans demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination. That ends today. Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great. \nSec. 2. Implementation. (a) The Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB), assisted by the Attorney General and the Director of the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM), shall coordinate the termination of all discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI and ‘‘diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility’’ (DEIA) mandates, policies, programs, pref-erences, and activities in the Federal Government, under whatever name they appear. To carry out this directive, the Director of OPM, with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall review and revise, as appropriate, all existing Federal employment practices, union contracts, and training policies or programs to comply with this order. Federal employ-ment practices, including Federal employee performance reviews, shall re-ward individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and shall not under any circumstances consider DEI or DEIA factors, goals, policies, mandates, or requirements. \n(b) Each agency, department, or commission head, in consultation with \nthe Attorney General, the Director of OMB, and the Director of OPM, as appropriate, shall take the following actions within sixty days of this order: \n(i) terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and ‘‘environmental justice’’ offices and positions (including but not lim-ited to ‘‘Chief Diversity Officer’’ positions); all ‘‘equity action plans,’’ ‘‘equity’’ actions, initiatives, or programs, ‘‘equity-related’’ grants or con-tracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements for employees, con-tractors, or grantees. \n(ii) provide the Director of the OMB with a list of all: \n(A) agency or department DEI, DEIA, or ‘‘environmental justice’’ posi-\ntions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures \nin existence on November 4, 2024, and an assessment of whether these positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expendi-tures have been misleadingly relabeled in an attempt to preserve their pre-November 4, 2024 function; \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:59 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE1.SGM 29JAE1khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOC5\n8340 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(B) Federal contractors who have provided DEI training or DEI training \nmaterials to agency or department employees; and \n(C) Federal grantees who received Federal funding to provide or advance \nDEI, DEIA, or ‘‘environmental justice’’ programs, services, or activities \nsince January 20, 2021. \n(iii) direct the deputy agency or department head to: \n(A) assess the operational impact (e.g., the number of new DEI hires) \nand cost of the prior administration’s DEI, DEIA, and ‘‘environmental \njustice’’ programs and policies; and \n(B) recommend actions, such as Congressional notifications under 28 \nU.S.C. 530D, to align agency or department programs, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices, enforcement activities, con-tracts (including set-asides), grants, consent orders, and litigating positions with the policy of equal dignity and respect identified in section 1 of this order. The agency or department head and the Director of OMB shall jointly ensure that the deputy agency or department head has the authority and resources needed to carry out this directive. \n(c) To inform and advise the President, so that he may formulate appro-\npriate and effective civil-rights policies for the Executive Branch, the Assist-\nant to the President for Domestic Policy shall convene a monthly meeting attended by the Director of OMB, the Director of OPM, and each deputy agency or department head to: \n(i) hear reports on the prevalence and the economic and social costs of DEI, DEIA, and ‘‘environmental justice’’ in agency or department pro-grams, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices, enforcement activities, contracts (including set-asides), grants, consent or-ders, and litigating positions; \n(ii) discuss any barriers to measures to comply with this order; and (iii) monitor and track agency and department progress and identify poten-\ntial areas for additional Presidential or legislative action to advance the policy of equal dignity and respect. \nSec. 3.

The order emphasizes that the Intelligence Community must remain apolitical and prohibits the misuse of clearances in elections. A report detailing further inappropriate activities is due within 90 days. This action aims to restore public trust and safeguard national security.",

Purpose. In the closing weeks of the 2020 Presidential campaign, \nat least 51 former intelligence officials coordinated with the Biden campaign \nto issue a letter discrediting the reporting that President Joseph R. Biden’s son had abandoned his laptop at a computer repair business. Signatories of the letter falsely suggested that the news story was part of a Russian disinformation campaign. \nBefore being issued, the letter was sent to the CIA Prepublication Classifica-\ntion Review Board, the body typically assigned to formally evaluate the sensitive nature of documents prior to publication. Senior CIA officials were made aware of the contents of the letter, and multiple signatories held clearances at the time and maintained ongoing contractual relationships with the CIA. \nFederal policymakers must be able to rely on analysis conducted by the \nIntelligence Community and be confident that it is accurate, crafted with professionalism, and free from politically motivated engineering to affect political outcomes in the United States. The signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions. This fabrication of the impri-matur of the Intelligence Community to suppress information essential to the American people during a Presidential election is an egregious breach of trust reminiscent of a third world country. And now the faith of Americans in all other patriotic intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect the Nation has been imperiled. \nNational security is also damaged by the publication of classified information. \nFormer National Security Advisor John R. Bolton published a memoir for monetary gain after he was terminated from his White House position in 2019. The book was rife with sensitive information drawn from his time in government. The memoir’s reckless treatment of sensitive information undermined the ability of future presidents to request and obtain candid advice on matters of national security from their staff. Publication also created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed. \nTo remedy these abuses of the public trust, this Order directs the revocation \nof any active or current security clearances held by: (i) the former intelligence officials who engaged in misleading and inappropriate political coordination with the 2020 Biden presidential campaign; and (ii) John R. Bolton. \nSec. 2. Policy. (a) It is the policy of the United States to ensure that the \nIntelligence Community not be engaged in partisan politics or otherwise \nused by a U.S. political campaign for electioneering purposes. The term ‘‘Intelligence Community’’ has the meaning given the term in section 3003 of title 50, United States Code. \n(b) It is the policy of the United States that individuals who hold govern-\nment-issued security clearances should not use their clearance status to influence U.S. elections. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:00 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE2.SGM 29JAE2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOC6\n8344 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(c) It is the policy of the United States that classified information not \nbe publicly disclosed in memoirs, especially those published for personal \nmonetary gain. \nSec. 3.

Background. The State of Alaska holds an abundant and largely \nuntapped supply of natural resources including, among others, energy, min-\neral, timber, and seafood. Unlocking this bounty of natural wealth will raise the prosperity of our citizens while helping to enhance our Nation’s economic and national security for generations to come. By developing these resources to the fullest extent possible, we can help deliver price relief for Americans, create high-quality jobs for our citizens, ameliorate our trade imbalances, augment the Nation’s exercise of global energy domi-nance, and guard against foreign powers weaponizing energy supplies in theaters of geopolitical conflict. \nUnleashing this opportunity, however, requires an immediate end to the \nassault on Alaska’s sovereignty and its ability to responsibly develop these resources for the benefit of the Nation. It is, therefore, imperative to imme-diately reverse the punitive restrictions implemented by the previous admin-istration that specifically target resource development on both State and Federal lands in Alaska. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to: \n(a) fully avail itself of Alaska’s vast lands and resources for the benefit \nof the Nation and the American citizens who call Alaska home; \n(b) efficiently and effectively maximize the development and production \nof the natural resources located on both Federal and State lands within \nAlaska; \n(c) expedite the permitting and leasing of energy and natural resource \nprojects in Alaska; and \n(d) prioritize the development of Alaska’s liquified natural gas (LNG) \npotential, including the sale and transportation of Alaskan LNG to other regions of the United States and allied nations within the Pacific region. \nSec. 3.

        "body": "Presidential Documents8433 \nFederal Register \nVol. 90, No. 18 \nWednesday, January 29, 2025 \nTitle 3— \nThe President Executive Order 14156 of January 20, 2025 \nDeclaring a National Energy Emergency \nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States of America, including the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (‘‘NEA’’), and section 301 of title 3, United \nStates Code, it is hereby ordered: \nSection 1. Purpose. The energy and critical minerals (‘‘energy’’) identification, \nleasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation \ncapacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs. We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness. Caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administra-tion, our Nation’s inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans, particularly those living on low- and fixed-incomes. \nThis active threat to the American people from high energy prices is exacer-\nbated by our Nation’s diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors. Energy security is an increasingly crucial theater of global competition. In an effort to harm the American people, hostile state and non-state foreign actors have targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within international commodity markets. An afford-able and reliable domestic supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for the national and economic security of any nation. \nThe integrity and expansion of our Nation’s energy infrastructure—from \ncoast to coast—is an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States’ national and economic security. It is imperative that the Federal government puts the physical and economic wellbeing of the American people first. \nMoreover, the United States has the potential to use its unrealized energy \nresources domestically, and to sell to international allies and partners a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy. This would create jobs and economic prosperity for Americans forgotten in the present econ-omy, improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners, and support international peace and security. Accordingly, our Nation’s dangerous energy situation inflicts unnecessary and perilous constraints on our foreign policy. \nThe policies of the previous administration have driven our Nation into \na national emergency, where a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid, require swift and decisive action. Without immediate remedy, this situation will dramatically deterio-rate in the near future due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology. The United States’ ability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy and the integrity of our Nation’s electrical grid. Our Nation’s current inadequate development of domestic energy resources leaves us vul-nerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States’ prosperity and national security. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:43 Jan 28, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\29JAE6.SGM 29JAE6khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOCB\n8434 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 18 / Wednesday, January 29, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nThese numerous problems are most pronounced in our Nation’s Northeast \nand West Coast, where dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the pros-perity of not only local residents but the entire United States population. The United States’ insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Na-tion’s economy, national security, and foreign policy. In light of these find-ings, I hereby declare a national emergency. \nSec. 2. Emergency Approvals. (a) The heads of executive departments and \nagencies (‘‘agencies’’) shall identify and exercise any lawful emergency au-\nthorities available to them, as well as all other lawful authorities they may possess, to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, trans-portation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands. If an agency assesses that use of either Federal eminent domain authorities or authorities afforded under the Defense Production Act (Public Law 81–774, 50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) are necessary to achieve this objective, the agency shall submit recommenda-tions for a course of action to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. \n(b) Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)(ii)(III), the Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, after consultation with, and concur-rence by, the Secretary of Energy, shall consider issuing emergency fuel waivers to allow the year-round sale of E15 gasoline to meet any projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of gasoline across the Nation. \nSec. 3. Expediting the Delivery of Energy Infrastructure. (a) To facilitate \nthe Nation’s energy supply, agencies shall identify and use all relevant \nlawful emergency and other authorities available to them to expedite the completion of all authorized and appropriated infrastructure, energy, environ-mental, and natural resources projects that are within the identified authority of each of the Secretaries to perform or to advance. \n(b) To protect the collective national and economic security of the United \nStates, agencies shall identify and use all lawful emergency or other authori-ties available to them to facilitate the supply, refining, and transportation of energy in and through the West Coast of the United States, Northeast of the United States, and Alaska. \n(c) The Secretaries shall provide such reports regarding activities under \nthis section as may be requested by the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy. \nSec. 4.

Purpose. The privilege of United States citizenship is a priceless \nand profound gift. The Fourteenth Amendment states: ‘‘All persons born \nor naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.’’ That provision rightly repudiated the Supreme Court of the United States’s shameful decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), \nwhich misinterpreted the Constitution as permanently excluding people of African descent from eligibility for United States citizenship solely based on their race. \nBut the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizen-\nship universally to everyone born within the United States. The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not ‘‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’’ Consistent with this understanding, the Congress has further specified through legislation that ‘‘a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof’’ is a national and citizen of the United States at birth, 8 U.S.C. 1401, generally mirroring the Fourteenth Amendment’s text. \nAmong the categories of individuals born in the United States and not \nsubject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship \ndoes not automatically extend to persons born in the United States: (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth. \nSec. 2. Policy. (a) It is the policy of the United States that no department \nor agency of the United States government shall issue documents recognizing \nUnited States citizenship, or accept documents issued by State, local, or other governments or authorities purporting to recognize United States citi-zenship, to persons: (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth. \n(b) Subsection (a) of this section shall apply only to persons who are \nborn within the United States after 30 days from the date of this order. \n(c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect the entitlement \nof other individuals, including children of lawful permanent residents, to obtain documentation of their United States citizenship. \nSec. 3. Enforcement.

Purpose. This order creates a process by which certain inter-\nnational cartels (the Cartels) and other organizations will be designated \nas Foreign Terrorist Organizations, consistent with section 219 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1189), or Specially Designated Global Terrorists, consistent with IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702) and Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001 (Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism), as amended. \n(a) International cartels constitute a national-security threat beyond that \nposed by traditional organized crime, with activities encompassing: \n(i) convergence between themselves and a range of extra-hemispheric ac-tors, from designated foreign-terror organizations to antagonistic foreign governments; \n(ii) complex adaptive systems, characteristic of entities engaged in insur-\ngency and asymmetric warfare; and \n(iii) infiltration into foreign governments across the Western Hemisphere. \nThe Cartels have engaged in a campaign of violence and terror throughout \nthe Western Hemisphere that has not only destabilized countries with signifi-cant importance for our national interests but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs. \nThe Cartels functionally control, through a campaign of assassination, terror, \nrape, and brute force nearly all illegal traffic across the southern border of the United States. In certain portions of Mexico, they function as quasi- governmental entities, controlling nearly all aspects of society. The Cartels’ activities threaten the safety of the American people, the security of the United States, and the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere. Their activities, proximity to, and incursions into the physical territory of the United States pose an unacceptable national security risk to the United States. \n(b) Other transnational organizations, such as Tren de Aragua (TdA) and \nLa Mara Salvatrucha (MS–13) pose similar threats to the United States. Their campaigns of violence and terror in the United States and internation-ally are extraordinarily violent, vicious, and similarly threaten the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere. \n(c) The Cartels and other transnational organizations, such as TdA and \nMS–13, operate both within and outside the United States. They present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. I hereby declare a national emergency, under IEEPA, to deal with those threats. \nSec. 2. Policy.

Purpose. The American people have witnessed the previous admin-\nistration engage in a systematic campaign against its perceived political \nopponents, weaponizing the legal force of numerous Federal law enforcement agencies and the Intelligence Community against those perceived political opponents in the form of investigations, prosecutions, civil enforcement \nactions, and other related actions. These actions appear oriented more toward inflicting political pain than toward pursuing actual justice or legitimate governmental objectives. Many of these activities appear to be inconsistent with the Constitution and/or the laws of the United States, including those activities directed at parents protesting at school board meetings, Americans who spoke out against the previous administration’s actions, and other Ameri-cans who were simply exercising constitutionally protected rights. \nThe prior administration and allies throughout the country engaged in an \nunprecedented, third-world weaponization of prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process. It targeted individuals who voiced opposition to the prior administration’s policies with numerous Federal investigations and politically motivated funding revocations, which cost Americans access to needed services. The Department of Justice even jailed an individual for posting a political meme. And while the Department of Justice has ruthlessly prosecuted more than 1,500 individuals associated with January 6, and simultaneously dropped nearly all cases against BLM rioters. \nTherefore, this order sets forth a process to ensure accountability for the \nprevious administration’s weaponization of the Federal Government against the American people. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to identify and take \nappropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government \nrelated to the weaponization of law enforcement and the weaponization of the Intelligence Community. \nSec. 3. Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government. (a) The Attor-\nney General, in consultation with the heads of all departments and agencies \nof the United States, shall take appropriate action to review the activities of all departments and agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority of the United States, including, but not limited to, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission, over the last 4 years and identify any instances where a depart-ment’s or agency’s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies of this order, and prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of this order. \n(b) The Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the heads \nof the appropriate departments and agencies within the Intelligence Commu-nity, shall take all appropriate action to review the activities of the Intel-ligence Community over the last 4 years and identify any instances where the Intelligence Community’s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies of this order, and prepare a report to be submitted \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:53 Jan 27, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\28JAE0.SGM 28JAE0ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E0\n8236 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 17 / Tuesday, January 28, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nto the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and the \nNational Security Advisor, with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of this order.

Purpose. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nan amendment essential to the success of our Republic, enshrines the right \nof the American people to speak freely in the public square without Govern-ment interference. Over the last 4 years, the previous administration trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans’ speech on online platforms, often by exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the Federal Government did not approve. Under the guise of combatting ‘‘misinformation,’’ ‘‘disinformation,’’ and ‘‘malinformation,’’ the Federal Government infringed on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advanced the Government’s preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate. Government censorship of speech is intolerable in a free society. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to: \n(a) secure the right of the American people to engage in constitutionally \nprotected speech; \n(b) ensure that no Federal Government officer, employee, or agent engages \nin or facilitates any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free \nspeech of any American citizen; \n(c) ensure that no taxpayer resources are used to engage in or facilitate \nany conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen; and \n(d) identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by \nthe Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech. \nSec. 3. Ending Censorship of Protected Speech. (a) No Federal department, \nagency, entity, officer, employee, or agent may act or use any Federal re-\nsources in a manner contrary to section 2 of this order. \n(b) The Attorney General, in consultation with the heads of executive \ndepartments and agencies, shall investigate the activities of the Federal Government over the last 4 years that are inconsistent with the purposes and policies of this order and prepare a report to be submitted to the President, through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions to be taken based on the findings of the report. \nSec. 4.

Purpose. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a defining technology of \nour era. Recent advancements in AI demonstrate its rapidly growing relevance \nto national security, including with respect to logistics, military capabilities, intelligence analysis, and cybersecurity. Building AI in the United States will help prevent adversaries from gaining access to, and using, powerful future systems to the detriment of our military and national security. It will also enable the United States Government to continue harnessing AI in service of national-security missions while preventing the United States from becoming dependent on other countries’ infrastructure to develop and operate powerful AI tools. \nAdvances at the frontier of AI will also have significant implications for \nUnited States economic competitiveness. These imperatives require building AI infrastructure in the United States on the time frame needed to ensure United States leadership over competitors who, already, are racing to take the lead in AI development and adoption. Building AI in the United States requires enormous private-sector investments in infrastructure, especially for the advanced computing clusters needed to train AI models and the energy infrastructure needed to power this work. Already, AI’s electricity and computational needs are vast, and they are set to surge in the years ahead. This work also requires secure, reliable supply chains for critical components needed to build AI infrastructure, from construction materials to advanced electronics. \nThis order sets our Nation on the path to ensure that future frontier AI \ncan, and will, continue to be built here in the United States. In building domestic AI infrastructure, our Nation will also advance its leadership in the clean energy technologies needed to power the future economy, including geothermal, solar, wind, and nuclear energy; foster a vibrant, competitive, and open technology ecosystem in the United States, in which small compa-nies can compete alongside large ones; maintain low consumer electricity prices; and help ensure that the development of AI infrastructure benefits the workers building it and communities near it. \nWith this order, I provide a plan for protecting national security, preserving \nour economic competitiveness, revitalizing our energy infrastructure, and ensuring United States leadership in AI. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to enable the development \nand operation of AI infrastructure, including data centers, in the United \nStates in accordance with five guiding principles. When undertaking the actions set forth in this order, executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall adhere to these principles, as appropriate and consistent with applicable \nlaw: \n(a) The development of AI infrastructure should advance United States \nnational security and leadership in AI. Meeting this goal will require steps by the Federal Government, in collaboration with the private sector, to advance AI development and use AI for future national-security missions, including through the work described in National Security Memorandum 25 of October 24, 2024 (Advancing the United States’ Leadership in Artificial \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 15:37 Jan 16, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\17JAE0.SGM 17JAE0KHAMMOND on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOC\n5470 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 11 / Friday, January 17, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nIntelligence; Harnessing Artificial Intelligence to Fulfill National Security \nObjectives; and Fostering the Safety, Security, and Trustworthiness of Artifi-cial Intelligence) (NSM–25). It will also require the use of safeguards to improve the cyber, supply-chain, and physical security of the laboratories at which powerful AI is developed, stored, and used. Additionally, protecting United States national security will require further work to evaluate and manage risks related to the powerful capabilities that future frontier AI may possess. \n(b) The development of AI infrastructure should advance United States \neconomic competitiveness, including by fostering a vibrant technology eco-system. Already, AI is creating new jobs and industries, and its effects are being felt in sectors across the economy. The Federal Government must ensure that the United States remains competitive in the global economy, including through harnessing the benefits of this technology for all Ameri-cans. It must also promote a fair, open, and competitive AI ecosystem so that small developers and entrepreneurs can continue to drive innova-tion—a priority highlighted in both Executive Order 14110 of October 30, 2023 (Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence), and NSM–25—as well as to support secure, reliable supply- chain infrastructure for AI activities. \n(c) The United States can and should lead the world in operating the \nnext generation of AI data centers with clean power. Meeting this goal will require building on recent successes to modernize our Nation’s energy infrastructure; improve permitting processes; and support investments in, and expeditious development of, both currently available and emerging clean energy technologies, such as geothermal energy, nuclear energy, and long- duration energy storage used to store clean energy, as well as relevant supply chains. The United States must not be surpassed in its support for the development, commercialization, and operation of clean energy tech-nologies at home and abroad, and the rapid buildout of AI infrastructure offers another vital opportunity to accelerate and deploy these energy tech-nologies. To help ensure that new data center electricity demand does not take clean power away from other end users, result in resource adequacy issues, or increase grid emissions, the construction of AI infrastructure must be matched with new, clean electricity generation resources. \n(d) The development of AI infrastructure should proceed without raising \nenergy costs for American consumers and businesses, and it should have strong community support. The companies developing, commercializing, and deploying AI must finance the cost of building the infrastructure needed for AI operations, including the development of next-generation power infra-structure built for these operations. \n(e) The development of AI infrastructure should benefit those working \nto build it. Meeting this goal will require high labor standards and safeguards for the buildout of AI infrastructure, consultation and close collaboration with communities affected by this infrastructure’s development and oper-ation, and continuous work to mitigate risks and potential harms. The Amer-ican people more broadly must safely enjoy the gains and opportunities from technological innovation in the AI ecosystem. \nSec. 3. Definitions.

Policy. Adversarial countries and criminals continue to conduct \ncyber campaigns targeting the United States and Americans, with the People’s \nRepublic of China presenting the most active and persistent cyber threat to United States Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure net-works. These campaigns disrupt the delivery of critical services across the Nation, cost billions of dollars, and undermine Americans’ security and privacy. More must be done to improve the Nation’s cybersecurity against these threats. \nBuilding on the foundational steps I directed in Executive Order 14028 \nof May 12, 2021 (Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity), and the initiatives detailed in the National Cybersecurity Strategy, I am ordering additional actions to improve our Nation’s cybersecurity, focusing on defending our digital infrastructure, securing the services and capabilities most vital to the digital domain, and building our capability to address key threats, includ-ing those from the People’s Republic of China. Improving accountability for software and cloud service providers, strengthening the security of Federal communications and identity management systems, and promoting innova-tive developments and the use of emerging technologies for cybersecurity across executive departments and agencies (agencies) and with the private sector are especially critical to improvement of the Nation’s cybersecurity. \nSec. 2. Operationalizing Transparency and Security in Third-Party Software \nSupply Chains. (a) The Federal Government and our Nation’s critical infra-\nstructure rely on software providers. Yet insecure software remains a chal-lenge for both providers and users and makes Federal Government and critical infrastructure systems vulnerable to malicious cyber incidents. The Federal Government must continue to adopt secure software acquisition practices and take steps so that software providers use secure software development practices to reduce the number and severity of vulnerabilities in software they produce. \n(b) Executive Order 14028 directed actions to improve the security and \nintegrity of software critical to the Federal Government’s ability to function. Executive Order 14028 directed the development of guidance on secure software development practices and on generating and providing evidence in the form of artifacts—computer records or data that are generated manually or by automated means—that demonstrate compliance with those practices. Additionally, it directed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to require agencies to use only software from providers that attest to using those secure software development practices. In some instances, providers of software to the Federal Government commit to following cyberse-curity practices, yet do not fix well-known exploitable vulnerabilities in their software, which puts the Government at risk of compromise.

(ii) Within 120 days of the receipt of the recommendations described \nin subsection (b)(i) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the recommendations and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (the agency members of the FAR Council) shall jointly take steps to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement those recommenda-tions. The agency members of the FAR Council are strongly encouraged to consider issuing an interim final rule, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. \n(iii) Within 60 days of the date of the issuance of the recommendations \ndescribed in subsection (b)(i) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall evaluate emerging methods of generating, receiving, and verifying machine-readable secure software development attestations and artifacts and, as appropriate, shall provide guidance for software providers on submitting them to CISA’s RSAA website, including a common data schema and format. \n(iv) Within 30 days of the date of any amendments to the FAR described \nin subsection (b)(ii) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall develop a program to centrally verify the completeness of all attestation forms. CISA shall continuously validate a sample of the complete attestations using high-level artifacts in the RSAA. \n(v) If CISA finds that attestations are incomplete or artifacts are insufficient \nfor validating the attestations, the Director of CISA shall notify the software provider and the contracting agency. The Director of CISA shall provide a process for the software provider to respond to CISA’s initial determina-tion and shall duly consider the response. \n(vi) For attestations that undergo validation, the Director of CISA shall \ninform the National Cyber Director, who shall publicly post the results, identifying the software providers and software version. The National Cyber Director is encouraged to refer attestations that fail validation to the Attorney General for action as appropriate. \n(c) Secure software development practices are not sufficient to address \nthe potential for cyber incidents from resourced and determined nation- \nstate actors. To mitigate the risk of such incidents occurring, software pro-viders must also address how software is delivered and the security of the software itself. The Federal Government must identify a coordinated set of practical and effective security practices to require when it procures software. \n(i) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, shall establish a consortium with industry at the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence to develop \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:33 Jan 17, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\17JAE3.SGM 17JAE3KHAMMOND on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOCB\n6757 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 11 / Friday, January 17, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nguidance, informed by the consortium as appropriate, that demonstrates \nthe implementation of secure software development, security, and oper-ations practices based on NIST Special Publication 800–218 (Secure Soft-ware Development Framework (SSDF)). \n(ii) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, \nacting through the Director of NIST, shall update NIST Special Publication 800–53 (Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organi-zations) to provide guidance on how to securely and reliably deploy patches and updates. \n(iii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, \nacting through the Director of NIST, in consultation with the heads of such agencies as the Director of NIST deems appropriate, shall develop and publish a preliminary update to the SSDF. This update shall include practices, procedures, controls, and implementation examples regarding the secure and reliable development and delivery of software as well as the security of the software itself. Within 120 days of publishing the preliminary update, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director \nof NIST, shall publish a final version of the updated SSDF. \n(iv) Within 120 days of the final update to the SSDF described in subsection \n(c)(iii) of this section, the Director of OMB shall incorporate select practices for the secure development and delivery of software contained in NIST’s updated SSDF into the requirements of OMB Memorandum M–22–18 (Enhancing the Security of the Software Supply Chain through Secure Software Development Practices) or related requirements. \n(v) Within 30 days of the issuance of OMB’s updated requirements de-\nscribed in subsection (c)(iv) of this section, the Director of CISA shall prepare any revisions to CISA’s common form for Secure Software Develop-ment Attestation to conform to OMB’s requirements and shall initiate any process required to obtain clearance of the revised form under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. \n(d) As agencies have improved their cyber defenses, adversaries have \ntargeted the weak links in agency supply chains and the products and \nservices upon which the Federal Government relies. Agencies need to inte-grate cybersecurity supply chain risk management programs into enterprise- wide risk management activities. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, the Administrator of General Services, and the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC), shall take steps to require, as the Director deems appropriate, that agencies comply with the guidance in NIST Special Publication 800–161 (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations (SP 800–161 Revision 1)). OMB shall require agencies to provide annual updates to OMB as they complete implementation. Consistent with SP 800–161 Revision 1, OMB’s requirements shall address the integration of cybersecurity into the acquisition lifecycle through acquisition planning, source selection, re-sponsibility determination, security compliance evaluation, contract adminis-tration, and performance evaluation. \n(e) Open source software plays a critical role in Federal information sys-\ntems. To help the Federal Government continue to reap the innovation and cost benefits of open source software and contribute to the cybersecurity of the open source software ecosystem, agencies must better manage their use of open source software. Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, and the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services and the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall jointly issue recommendations to agencies on the use of security assessments and patching of open source software and best practices for contributing to open source software projects. \nSec. 3.

These pilot deployments shall be used to inform future directions for Federal identity, credentialing, and access management strategies. \n(c) The Federal Government must maintain the ability to rapidly and \neffectively identify threats across the Federal enterprise. In Executive Order 14028, I directed the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish procedures to immediately share threat information to strengthen the collective defense of Department of Defense and civilian networks. To enable identification of threat activity, CISA’s capability to hunt for and identify threats across FCEB agencies under 44 U.S.C. 3553(b)(7) must be strengthened. \n(i) The Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, in coordination with the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council and Federal Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Council, shall develop the technical capability to gain timely access to required data from FCEB agency endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and from FCEB agency security operation centers to enable: \n(A) timely hunting and identification of novel cyber threats and \nvulnerabilities across the Federal civilian enterprise; \n(B) identification of coordinated cyber campaigns that simultaneously \ntarget multiple agencies and move laterally across the Federal enterprise; and \n(C) coordination of Government-wide efforts on information security \npolicies and practices, including compilation and analysis of information about incidents that threaten information security. \n(ii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, acting through the Director of CISA, in coordination with the Federal CIO and CISO Councils, shall develop and release a concept of operations that enables CISA to gain timely access to required data to achieve the objectives described in subsection (c)(i) of this section. The Director of OMB shall oversee the development of this concept of operations to account for agency perspectives and the objectives outlined in this section and shall approve the final concept of operations. This concept of operations shall include: \n(A) requirements for FCEB agencies to provide CISA with data of suffi-\ncient completeness and on the timeline required to enable CISA to achieve the objectives described in subsection (c)(i) of this section; \n(B) requirements for CISA to provide FCEB agencies with advanced \nnotification when CISA directly accesses agency EDR solutions to obtain required telemetry; \n(C) specific use cases for which agencies may provide telemetry data \nsubject to the requirements in subsection (c)(ii)(A) of this section as op-posed to direct access to EDR solutions by CISA; \n(D) high-level technical and policy control requirements to govern CISA \naccess to agency EDR solutions that conform with widely accepted cyberse-curity principles, including role-based access controls, ‘‘least privilege,’’ and separation of duties; \n(E) specific protections for highly sensitive agency data that is subject \nto statutory, regulatory, or judicial restrictions to protect confidentiality or integrity; and \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:33 Jan 17, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\17JAE3.SGM 17JAE3KHAMMOND on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOCB\n6759 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 11 / Friday, January 17, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(F) an appendix to the concept of operations that identifies and addresses \ncertain types of specific use cases under subsection (c)(ii)(C) of this section \nthat apply to the Department of Justice, including certain categories of information described in subsections (c)(vi) and (c)(vii) of this section, and requires the Department of Justice’s concurrence on the terms of the appendix prior to implementation of the concept of operations on the Department of Justice’s or its subcomponents’ networks. \n(iii) In undertaking the activities described in subsection (c) of this section, \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall only make a change to an agency network, system, or data when such change is required for threat hunting by CISA, including access to the EDR tools described in subsection (c)(ii) of this section, or in furtherance of its authority to conduct threat hunting as authorized under 44 U.S.C. 3553(b)(7), unless otherwise authorized by the agency. \n(iv) Within 30 days of the release of the concept of operations described \nin subsection (c)(ii) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall establish working groups, open to all agencies, to develop and release specific technical controls that achieve the objectives set forth in subsection (c)(ii) of this section and to work with EDR solution providers to implement those controls in FCEB agency deployments of EDR solutions. The Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall, at a minimum, establish a working group for each EDR solution authorized by CISA for use in the CISA Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation Program. Each working group shall be open to all agencies and include at least one representative from an FCEB agency employing the designated EDR solution. \n(v) Within 180 days of the release of the technical controls described \nin subsection (c)(iv) of this section, the heads of FCEB agencies shall enroll endpoints using an EDR solution covered by those controls in the CISA Persistent Access Capability program. \n(vi) Within 90 days of the date of this order, and periodically thereafter \nas needed, the heads of FCEB agencies shall provide to CISA a list of systems, endpoints, and data sets that require additional controls or periods of non-disruption to ensure that CISA’s threat-hunting activities do not disrupt mission-critical operations, along with an explanation of those operations. \n(vii) In cases in which agency data is subject to statutory, regulatory, \nor judicial access restrictions, the Director of CISA shall comply with agency processes and procedures required to access such data or work with the agency to develop an appropriate administrative accommodation consistent with any such restrictions so that the data is not subject to unauthorized access or use. \n(viii) Nothing in this order requires an agency to provide access to informa-\ntion that is protected from non-disclosure by court order or otherwise required to be kept confidential in connection with a judicial proceeding. \n(d) The security of Federal information systems relies on the security \nof the Government’s cloud services. Within 90 days of the date of this \norder, the Administrator of General Services, acting through the Director of the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall develop FedRAMP policies and practices to incentivize or require cloud service providers in the FedRAMP Marketplace to produce baselines with specifications and recommendations for agency configuration of agency cloud-based systems in order to secure Federal data based on agency requirements. \n(e) As cybersecurity threats to space systems increase, these systems and \ntheir supporting digital infrastructure must be designed to adapt to evolving cybersecurity threats and operate in contested environments.

Routing information origi-\nnated and propagated across the internet, utilizing the Border Gateway Pro-tocol (BGP), is vulnerable to attack and misconfiguration. \n(i) Within 90 days of the date of this order, FCEB agencies shall take steps to ensure that all of their assigned internet number resources (internet Protocol (IP) address blocks and Autonomous System Numbers) are covered by a Registration Services Agreement with the American Registry for inter-net Numbers or another appropriate regional internet registry. Thereafter, FCEB agencies shall annually review and update in their regional internet registry accounts organizational identifiers related to assigned number re-sources such as organization names, points of contact, and associated email addresses. \n(ii) Within 120 days of the date of this order, all FCEB agencies that \nhold IP address blocks shall create and publish Route Origin Authorizations in the public Resource Public Key Infrastructure repository hosted or delegated by the American Registry for internet Numbers or the appropriate regional internet registry for the IP address blocks they hold. \n(iii) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the National Cyber Director, \nin coordination with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall recommend contract language to the FAR Council to require contracted providers of internet services to agencies to adopt and deploy internet routing security technologies, including publishing Route Origin Authoriza-tions and performing Route Origin Validation filtering. The recommended language shall include requirements or exceptions, as appropriate, for agency contracts regarding overseas operations and overseas local service providers. Within 270 days of receiving these recommendations, the FAR Council shall review the recommended contract language and, as appro-priate and consistent with applicable law, the agency members of the FAR Council shall jointly take steps to amend the FAR. Pending any such amendments to the FAR, individual agencies are encouraged to in-clude such requirements in future contracts, consistent with applicable law. \n(iv) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, \nacting through the Director of NIST, shall publish updated guidance to agencies on deployment of current, operationally viable BGP security meth-ods for Federal Government networks and service providers. The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, shall also provide updated guidance on other emerging technologies to improve internet routing security and resilience, such as route leak mitigation and source address validation. \n(c) Encrypting Domain Name System (DNS) traffic in transit is a critical \nstep to protecting both the confidentiality of the information being trans-\nmitted to, and the integrity of the communication with, the DNS resolver. \n(i) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall publish template con-tract language requiring that any product that acts as a DNS resolver (whether client or server) for the Federal Government support encrypted DNS and shall recommend that language to the FAR Council. Within 120 days of receiving the recommended language, the FAR Council shall review it, and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the agency members of the FAR Council shall jointly take steps to amend the FAR. \n(ii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, FCEB agencies shall enable \nencrypted DNS protocols wherever their existing clients and servers sup-port those protocols. FCEB agencies shall also enable such protocols within 180 days of any additional clients and servers supporting such protocols. \n(d) The Federal Government must encrypt email messages in transport \nand, where practical, use end-to-end encryption in order to protect messages \nfrom compromise. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:33 Jan 17, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\17JAE3.SGM 17JAE3KHAMMOND on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOCB\n6762 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 11 / Friday, January 17, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(i) Within 120 days of the date of this order, each FCEB agency shall \ntechnically enforce encrypted and authenticated transport for all connec-tions between the agency’s email clients and their associated email servers. \n(ii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB shall \nestablish a requirement for expanded use of authenticated transport-layer encryption between email servers used by FCEB agencies to send and receive email. \n(iii) Within 90 days of the establishment of the requirement described \nin subsection (d)(ii) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall take appropriate steps to assist agencies in meeting that requirement, including by issuing implementing directives, as well as technical guidance to address any identified capability gaps. \n(e) Modern communications such as voice and video conferencing and \ninstant messaging are usually encrypted at the link level but often are \nnot encrypted end-to-end. Within 180 days of the date of this order, to \nadvance the security of internet-based voice and video conferencing and instant messaging, the Director of OMB, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA; the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA); the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST; the Archivist of the United States, acting through the Chief Records Officer for the United States Government; and the Administrator of General Services shall take appropriate steps to require agencies to: \n(i) enable transport encryption by default; and \n(ii) where technically supported, use end-to-end encryption by default \nwhile maintaining logging and archival capabilities that allow agencies to fulfill records management and accountability requirements. \n(f) Alongside their benefits, quantum computers pose significant risk to \nthe national security, including the economic security, of the United States. \nMost notably, a quantum computer of sufficient size and sophistication— also known as a cryptanalytically relevant quantum computer (CRQC)— will be capable of breaking much of the public-key cryptography used on digital systems across the United States and around the world. In National Security Memorandum 10 of May 4, 2022 (Promoting United States Leader-ship in Quantum Computing While Mitigating Risks to Vulnerable Cryp-tographic Systems), I directed the Federal Government to prepare for a transition to cryptographic algorithms that would not be vulnerable to a CRQC. \n(i) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall release and thereafter regularly update a list of product categories in which products that support post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are widely available. \n(ii) Within 90 days of a product category being placed on the list described \nin subsection (f)(i) of this section, agencies shall take steps to include in any solicitations for products in that category a requirement that prod-ucts support PQC. \n(iii) Agencies shall implement PQC key establishment or hybrid key estab-\nlishment including a PQC algorithm as soon as practicable upon support being provided by network security products and services already deployed in their network architectures. \n(iv) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State \nand the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST and the Under Secretary for International Trade, shall identify and engage foreign governments and industry groups in key countries to encourage their transition to PQC algorithms standardized by NIST. \n(v) Within 180 days of the date of this order, to prepare for transition \nto PQC, the Secretary of Defense with respect to National Security Systems (NSS), and the Director of OMB with respect to non-NSS, shall each \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:33 Jan 17, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\17JAE3.SGM 17JAE3KHAMMOND on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOCB\n6763 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 11 / Friday, January 17, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nissue requirements for agencies to support, as soon as practicable, but \nnot later than January 2, 2030, Transport Layer Security protocol version 1.3 or a successor version. \n(g) The Federal Government should take advantage of commercial security \ntechnologies and architectures, such as hardware security modules, trusted \nexecution environments, and other isolation technologies, to protect and audit access to cryptographic keys with extended lifecycles. \n(i) Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, and the Admin-istrator of General Services shall develop guidelines for the secure manage-ment of access tokens and cryptographic keys used by cloud service pro-viders. \n(ii) Within 60 days of the publication of the guidelines described in \nsubsection (g)(i) of this section, the Administrator of General Services, acting through the FedRAMP Director, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA, shall develop updated FedRAMP requirements, incorporating the guidelines described in subsection (g)(i) of this section, as appropriate and consistent with guidance issued by the Director of OMB, concerning cryptographic key management security practices. \n(iii) Within 60 days of the publication of the guidelines described in \nsubsection (g)(i) of this section, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST; the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA; and the Administrator of General Services shall take appropriate steps to require FCEB agencies to follow best practices concerning the protection and management of hardware security modules, trusted execution environ-ments, or other isolation technologies for access tokens and cryptographic keys used by cloud service providers in the provision of services to agencies. \nSec. 5. Solutions to Combat Cybercrime and Fraud. (a) The use of stolen \nand synthetic identities by criminal syndicates to systemically defraud public benefits programs costs taxpayers and wastes Federal Government funds. To help address these crimes it is the policy of the executive branch to strongly encourage the acceptance of digital identity documents to access public benefits programs that require identity verification, so long as it is done in a manner that preserves broad program access for vulnerable populations and supports the principles of privacy, data minimization, and interoperability. \n(i) Within 90 days of the date of this order, agencies with grantmaking authority are encouraged to consider, in coordination with OMB and the National Security Council staff, whether Federal grant funding is available to assist States in developing and issuing mobile driver’s licenses that \nachieve the policies and principles described in this section. \n(ii) Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, \nacting through the Director of NIST, shall issue practical implementation guidance, in collaboration with relevant agencies and other stakeholders through the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, to support remote digital identity verification using digital identity documents that will help issuers and verifiers of digital identity documents advance the policies and principles described in this section. \n(iii) Agencies should consider accepting digital identity documents as \ndigital identity verification evidence to access public benefits programs, but only if the use of these documents is consistent with the policies and principles described in this section. \n(iv) Agencies should, consistent with applicable law, seek to ensure that \ndigital identity documents accepted as digital identity verification evidence to access public benefits programs: \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:33 Jan 17, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\17JAE3.SGM 17JAE3KHAMMOND on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOCB\n6764 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 11 / Friday, January 17, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(A) are interoperable with relevant standards and trust frameworks, so \nthat the public can use any standards-compliant hardware or software \ncontaining an official Government-issued digital identity document, regard-less of manufacturer or developer; \n(B) do not enable authorities that issue digital identity documents, device \nmanufacturers, or any other third party to surveil or track presentation of the digital identity document, including user device location at the time of presentation; and \n(C) support user privacy and data minimization by ensuring only the \nminimum information required for a transaction—often a ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ response to a question, such as whether an individual is older than a \nspecific age—is requested from the holder of the digital identity document. \n(b) The use of ‘‘Yes/No’’ validation services, also referred to as attribute \nvalidation services, can enable more privacy-preserving means to reduce \nidentity fraud. These services allow programs to confirm, via a privacy- preserving ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ response, that applicant-provided identity informa-tion is consistent with information already contained in official records, without needing to share the contents of those official records. To support the use of such services, the Commissioner of Social Security, and the head of any other agency designated by the Director of OMB, shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, consider taking steps to develop or modify services—including through, as appropriate, the initiation of a proposed rulemaking or the publication of a notice of a new or signifi-cantly modified routine use of records—related to Government-operated iden-tity verification systems and public benefits programs, with consideration given to having such systems and programs submit applicant-provided iden-tity information to the agency providing the service and receive a ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ response as to whether the applicant-provided identity information is consistent with the information on file with the agency providing the service. In doing so, the heads of these agencies shall specifically consider seeking to ensure, consistent with applicable law, that: \n(i) any applicant-provided identity information submitted to the services and any ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ response provided by the services are used only to assist with identity verification, program administration, anti-fraud oper-ations, or investigation and prosecution of fraud related to the public benefits program for which the identity information was submitted; \n(ii) the services are made available, to the maximum extent permissible \nand as appropriate, to public benefits programs; Government-operated iden-tity verification systems, including shared-service providers; payment integ-rity programs; and United States-regulated financial institutions; and \n(iii) the agencies, public benefits programs, or institutions using the services \nprovide reimbursement to appropriately cover costs and support the ongo-ing maintenance, improvement, and broad accessibility of the services. \n(c) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Administrator \nof General Services, shall research, develop, and conduct a pilot program \nfor technology that notifies individuals and entities when their identity information is used to request a payment from a public benefits program, gives individuals and entities the option to stop potentially fraudulent trans-actions before they occur, and reports fraudulent transactions to law enforce-ment entities. \nSec. 6. Promoting Security with and in Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intel-\nligence (AI) has the potential to transform cyber defense by rapidly identi-\nfying new vulnerabilities, increasing the scale of threat detection techniques, and automating cyber defense. The Federal Government must accelerate the development and deployment of AI, explore ways to improve the cyberse-curity of critical infrastructure using AI, and accelerate research at the inter-section of AI and cybersecurity. \n(a) Within 180 days of the date of the completion of the Defense Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency’s 2025 Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge, the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, acting \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:33 Jan 17, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\17JAE3.SGM 17JAE3KHAMMOND on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOCB\n6765 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 11 / Friday, January 17, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nthrough the Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, \nand the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall launch a pilot program, involv-ing collaboration with private sector critical infrastructure entities as appro-priate and consistent with applicable law, on the use of AI to enhance cyber defense of critical infrastructure in the energy sector, and conduct an assessment of the pilot program upon its completion. This pilot program, and accompanying assessment, may include vulnerability detection, auto-matic patch management, and the identification and categorization of anoma-lous and malicious activity across information technology (IT) or operational technology systems. \n(b) Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense \nshall establish a program to use advanced AI models for cyber defense. \n(c) Within 150 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, \nacting through the Director of NIST; the Secretary of Energy; the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Under Secretary for Science and Technology; and the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) shall each prioritize funding for their respective programs that encourage the development of large-scale, labeled datasets needed to make progress on cyber defense research, and ensure that existing datasets for cyber defense research have been made accessible to the broader academic research commu-nity (either securely or publicly) to the maximum extent feasible, in consider-ation of business confidentiality and national security. \n(d) Within 150 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, \nacting through the Director of NIST; the Secretary of Energy; the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Under Secretary for Science and Technology; and the Director of the NSF shall prioritize research on the following topics: \n(i) human-AI interaction methods to assist defensive cyber analysis; \n(ii) security of AI coding assistance, including security of AI-generated \ncode; \n(iii) methods for designing secure AI systems; and (iv) methods for prevention, response, remediation, and recovery of cyber \nincidents involving AI systems. \n(e) Within 150 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, \nin coordination with the Director of OMB, shall incorporate management of AI software vulnerabilities and compromises into their respective agencies’ existing processes and interagency coordination mechanisms for vulnerability management, including through incident tracking, response, and reporting, and by sharing indicators of compromise for AI systems. \nSec. 7. Aligning Policy to Practice. (a) IT infrastructure and networks that \nsupport agencies’ critical missions need to be modernized. Agencies’ policies \nmust align investments and priorities to improve network visibility and security controls to reduce cyber risks. \n(i) Within 3 years of the date of this order, the Director of OMB shall issue guidance, including any necessary revision to OMB Circular A– 130, to address critical risks and adapt modern practices and architectures across Federal information systems and networks. This guidance shall, at a minimum: \n(A) outline expectations for agency cybersecurity information sharing \nand exchange, enterprise visibility, and accountability for enterprise-wide cybersecurity programs by agency CISOs; \n(B) revise OMB Circular A–130 to be less technically prescriptive in \nkey areas, where appropriate, to more clearly promote the adoption of evolving cybersecurity best practices across Federal systems, and to include migration to zero trust architectures and implementation of critical ele-ments such as EDR capabilities, encryption, network segmentation, and phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication; and \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:33 Jan 17, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\17JAE3.SGM 17JAE3KHAMMOND on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOCB\n6766 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 11 / Friday, January 17, 2025 / Presidential Documents \n(C) address how agencies should identify, assess, respond to, and mitigate \nrisks to mission essential functions presented by concentration of IT ven-\ndors and services. \n(ii) The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST; \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of CISA; and the Director of OMB shall establish a pilot program of a rules-as- code approach for machine-readable versions of policy and guidance that OMB, NIST, and CISA publish and manage regarding cybersecurity. \n(b) Managing cybersecurity risks is now a part of everyday industry practice \nand should be expected for all types of businesses. Minimum cybersecurity \nrequirements can make it costlier and harder for threat actors to compromise networks. Within 240 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Com-merce, acting through the Director of NIST, shall evaluate common cybersecu-rity practices and security control outcomes that are commonly used or recommended across industry sectors, international standards bodies, and other risk management programs, and based on that evaluation issue guidance identifying minimum cybersecurity practices. In developing this guidance, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of NIST, shall solicit input from the Federal Government, the private sector, academia, and other appropriate actors. \n(c) Agencies face multiple cybersecurity risks when purchasing products \nand services. While agencies have already made significant advances to improve their supply chain risk management, additional actions are needed to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape. Within 180 days of the issuance of the guidance described in subsection (b) of this section, the FAR Council shall review the guidance and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the agency members of the FAR Council shall jointly take steps to amend the FAR to: \n(i) require that contractors with the Federal Government follow applicable minimum cybersecurity practices identified in NIST’s guidance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section with respect to work performed under agency contracts or when developing, maintaining, or supporting IT serv-ices or products that are provided to the Federal Government; and \n(ii) adopt requirements for agencies to, by January 4, 2027, require vendors \nto the Federal Government of consumer internet-of-Things products, as defined by 47 CFR 8.203(b), to carry United States Cyber Trust Mark labeling for those products. \nSec. 8. National Security Systems and Debilitating Impact Systems. (a) Except \nas specifically provided for in section 4(f)(v) of this order, sections 1 through 7 of this order shall not apply to Federal information systems that are NSS or are otherwise identified by the Department of Defense or the Intel-ligence Community as debilitating impact systems. \n(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, to help ensure that NSS \nand debilitating impact systems are protected with the most advanced secu-rity measures, the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Director of NSA as the National Manager for National Security Systems (National Manager), in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS), and in consultation with the Director of OMB and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), shall develop requirements for NSS and debilitating impact systems that are consistent with the requirements set forth in this order, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. The Secretary of Defense may grant exceptions to such requirements in circumstances necessitated by unique mission needs. Such requirements shall be incorporated into a proposed National Security Memorandum, to be submitted to the President through the APNSA. \n(c) To help protect space NSS with cybersecurity measures that keep \npace with emerging threats, within 210 days of the date of this order, the CNSS shall review and update, as appropriate, relevant policies and guidance regarding space system cybersecurity.

Within 110 days, the Departments of Education and Homeland Security will develop guidelines for effective, trauma-informed active-shooter drills in schools. This initiative aims to improve safety measures and reduce gun violence.",

        "body": "Presidential Documents80345 \nFederal Register \nVol. 89, No. 191 \nWednesday, October 2, 2024 \nTitle 3— \nThe President Executive Order 14127 of September 26, 2024 \nCombating Emerging Firearms Threats and Improving School- \nBased Active-Shooter Drills \nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: \nSection 1. Policy. During 2020, the last year of the prior administration, \nhomicides in the Nation increased nearly 30 percent over the previous \nyear—the largest 1-year increase in murders ever recorded. After that, the Vice President and I took action to reduce gun crime and other forms of violent crime. By the middle of 2022, we had already taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other administration at that point in time. On June 25, 2022, I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (Public Law 117–159)—the most significant new gun violence prevention law in nearly 30 years. Rates of homicide in the United States are falling at one of the fastest rates ever recorded. Year-over-year comparison shows that 2023 had one of the largest declines in the homicide rate in recent history. This life-saving progress has continued in 2024. While we have made great progress, much more work remains to be done to reduce gun violence and save lives. \nIt is the policy of my Administration to coordinate across executive depart-\nments and agencies (agencies) to reduce gun violence and save lives. This order directs enhanced coordination for two key challenges: combating emerg-ing firearms threats and understanding and improving school-based active- shooter drills. \nOne way to continue the progress on reducing gun violence is to stay \nahead of emerging violent crime threats involving firearms. My Administra-tion has always taken these threats seriously. In April 2021, one of my Administration’s first executive actions to reduce gun violence was directed at stopping the proliferation of firearms without serial numbers, often referred to as ‘‘ghost guns.’’ To expand these efforts, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) of the Department of Justice established an Emerging Threats Center, which focuses ATF’s resources on identifying developments in illicit firearm marketplaces, including the use of new tech-nologies to make and unlawfully distribute undetectable firearms and devices that convert semiautomatic firearms into illegal machineguns. The Vice Presi-dent and I strongly disagreed with the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down an important gun safety regulation on bump stocks—the device used in the shooting at a crowded music festival in Las Vegas—and called on the Congress to clarify that this dangerous accessory is a machinegun. \nThe Court’s decision addressing bump stocks did not alter the statutory \nprohibition on machinegun conversion devices, which are prohibited for non-governmental possession even when not installed on a firearm. The threat posed by the continued proliferation of these devices is particularly acute. These devices enable semiautomatic firearms, including easily conceal-able handguns, to match or exceed the rate of fire of many military machine-guns with a single engagement of the trigger—up to 20 bullets in one second and 1,200 rounds in one minute. From 2017 through 2021, ATF recovered 5,454 of these devices—a 570 percent increase over the previous 5-year period. These devices are often illegally imported or illegally made on a 3D printer. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 19:22 Oct 01, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\02OCE0.SGM 02OCE0lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC0\n80346 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 191 / Wednesday, October 2, 2024 / Presidential Documents \nUnserialized, 3D printed firearms—which can be used for illicit purposes \nsuch as gun trafficking, possession by people convicted of felonies or subject to domestic violence restraining orders, or unlawful engagement in the busi-ness of manufacturing or selling firearms—are another emerging threat. These firearms can be 3D printed from computer code downloaded from the internet and produced without serial numbers, which law enforcement uses to trace firearms recovered in criminal investigations. Some 3D printed firearms can be rendered undetectable by magnetometers used to secure airports, courthouses, and certain events. 3D printing technology is developing quick-ly, which can cause the safety threat of 3D printed firearms to suddenly increase. \nIn addition to the threat of domestic crime, these emerging firearms threats \npose a significant risk to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. Many foreign countries have heavily regulated automatic weapons and 3D printed and undetectable firearms. The wide availability of these emerging firearms threats would undermine other nations’ gun laws and the safety and security of our allies. Technical data and software for 3D printed firearms and machinegun conversion devices can be used by international gangs, criminals, and terrorists in a manner contrary to United States national security and foreign policy interests. \nMultiple agencies have the authority to help stop the proliferation of these \nemerging threats, and it is the policy of the United States to work collectively across agencies to identify threats, engage in information sharing, and work together to develop and implement effective strategies to combat these threats. Authorities that can address emerging firearms threats extend beyond the Gun Control Act (Public Law 90–618) and the National Firearms Act (Public Law 73–474). Focused and enhanced coordination is needed to ensure a unified and robust strategy for enforcing existing legal authorities and using every available tool and resource. This interagency effort will build on the life-saving work that has occurred to date to stop the proliferation of machinegun conversion devices, including the ongoing efforts at the De-partment of Justice and ATF. \nMy Administration also has invested significant resources in school safety \nand has taken steps to keeps firearms out of schools. These steps have focused on preventing unauthorized access to firearms for youth and individ-uals in crisis; supporting schools that are implementing evidence-based safety and gun-violence prevention and intervention solutions; and addressing the mental health needs of students, particularly those impacted by gun violence. \nKeeping students and educators, including teachers and other school per-\nsonnel, safe from gun violence in their schools is a top priority for my Administration, but there is more to do to make our schools safer. Since the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, according to one analysis, there have been more than 400 school shootings that exposed more than 375,000 students to gun violence. Exposure to school shootings takes a terrible toll on students and educators. A nationally representative study found that 51 percent of 14- to 17-year-olds in the United States worry about school shootings. \nThe majority of States require schools to conduct active-shooter drills for \nstudents and educators. About 95 percent of K–12 public schools in the United States conduct lockdown drills, which include drills to prepare for an active-shooter situation. These drills vary widely in their approach, and many parents, students, and educators have expressed concerns over the effectiveness of and trauma caused by some approaches to these drills. \nDespite their ubiquity, there is very limited research on how to design \nand deploy these drills to maximize their effectiveness and minimize any collateral harms they might cause. While additional research is ongoing, it is difficult to conclusively determine which specific practices are most effective in preparing schools for active-shooter incidents, preventing injuries \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 19:22 Oct 01, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\02OCE0.SGM 02OCE0lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC0\n80347 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 191 / Wednesday, October 2, 2024 / Presidential Documents \nand fatalities, and minimizing any associated psychological impacts or trau-\nmas. The Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Serv-ices, the Department of Education, and the Department of Homeland Security continue to work together on a range of school safety issues, including the beginnings of research into these important questions. It is time for these agencies to extend their efforts to help schools better design and conduct effective and age- and developmentally appropriate active-shooter drills. \nSec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order: \n(a) The term ‘‘machinegun’’ has the meaning given by 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(24) \nand 26 U.S.C. 5845(b), and includes a ‘‘machinegun conversion device,’’ \nwhich is any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combina-tion of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun. \n(b) The term ‘‘undetectable firearm’’ means a firearm as proscribed by \n18 U.S.C. 922(p). \n(c) The term ‘‘3D printing’’ refers to the additive manufacturing process, \nduring which producers transmit digital designs to 3D printers. The comput-erized design guides the fabrication of products, building them up layer by layer rather than cutting away from a large block of existing material as in most traditional manufacturing. This term includes additive manufac-turing technology used to produce a firearm, firearm frame or receiver, or machinegun conversion device. \nSec. 3. Combating Emerging Firearms Threats.

        "body": "Presidential Documents73559 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 176 / Wednesday, September 11, 2024 / Presidential Documents \nExecutive Order 14126 of September 6, 2024 \nInvesting in America and Investing in American Workers \nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: \nSection 1. Policy. The Federal Government has made significant strides \nin implementing the Investing in America agenda, a historic set of recently \nenacted laws aimed at rebuilding American infrastructure, bringing back American manufacturing, and catalyzing a clean energy economy. That agen-da has been furthered by Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation \nReduction Act of 2022), and Executive Order 14080 of August 25, 2022 (Implementation of the CHIPS Act of 2022). As implementation of the Invest-ing in America agenda continues, it is essential that it supports the creation of well-paying jobs, especially union jobs, that improve opportunities for millions of Americans. Investing in American workers is critical to growing the economy equitably and resiliently, increasing our Nation’s competitive-ness, and ensuring our Nation’s economic security. Workers understand the value of a good job that provides economic security for them and their families. Many companies also recognize that providing good-quality jobs while promoting workers’ free and fair choice to join a union makes those companies employers of choice, creating a clear competitive advantage. \nThe Federal Government has long promoted high labor standards to ensure \nfair competition, stability, and efficiency on federally assisted projects. The use of high labor standards on federally assisted projects, such as the use of prevailing wages, project labor agreements, and equal employment oppor-tunity policies, dates back almost a century. These tools ensure timely and economical completion of projects, provide a reliable source of highly skilled workers, support equitable workforce development, and improve worker health and safety on the job, while also improving outcomes for the communities in which projects are located. But these tools can and should be employed to a greater extent than they have been in the past. \nFor instance, providing incentives for federally assisted projects with high \nlabor standards—including those using collective bargaining agreements, project labor agreements, and certain community benefits agreements—drives efficient project completion while also supporting high-quality jobs, worker safety, and broader investment in communities. Ensuring that workers on federally assisted projects are paid competitive and equitable wages will enhance worker productivity, generate higher-quality work, and reduce turn-over, providing value for taxpayers. Promoting inclusivity, with equal oppor-tunity for all qualified workers, will help ensure that federally assisted projects have the workforce needed to implement the Investing in America agenda. \nTherefore, it is the policy of my Administration to promote the creation \nof equitable workforce development pathways for workers to obtain good jobs that pay family-sustaining wages, provide critical benefits, prevent work-place discrimination, ensure worker safety, and allow workers a free and fair chance to join a union. \nSec. 2.

Over half of Hispanic and Latino postsecondary students in America attend an HSI, and nearly 40 percent of those students attend a 2-year HSI. Hispanic-Serving Institutions serve a significant number of students from low-income backgrounds. Stu-dents enrolled at HSIs account for approximately 30 percent of all Pell Grant recipients, even though these colleges and universities make up only 13 percent of all postsecondary degree-granting institutions. Further, HSIs can play a critical role in fostering diversity in science, technology, engineer-ing, and mathematics fields. Notably, 69 percent of doctoral students in HSIs are enrolled in science- and engineering-related degrees, highlighting the significant role HSIs can play in ensuring a workforce that meets the Nation’s evolving needs in technical fields. \nAs Hispanic and Latino college enrollment has grown to historic levels \nover the last few decades, so has the number of HSIs, making HSIs’ success vital to the strength of the Nation. These institutions are creating and imple-menting evidence-based practices that lead to Hispanic and Latino student success. \nDespite the fact that HSIs represent a large and fast-growing segment of \nthe Nation’s colleges and universities, per-student Federal funding at HSIs is 25 percent less than at other degree-granting institutions. Over the last 30 years, the number of HSIs has more than doubled and Hispanic or Latino student enrollment at HSIs has more than tripled. But per-student Federal funding at HSIs remains low compared to degree-granting institutions generally, and many HSIs report having unmet physical and digital infrastruc-ture needs. This scarcity of resources often leaves HSIs at a disadvantage when compared with better-resourced institutions. Students, faculty, and staff at under-resourced HSIs often face challenges in accessing the resources they need to excel. \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 21:59 Jul 19, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\22JYE0.SGM 22JYE0ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E0\n59586 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 140 / Monday, July 22, 2024 / Presidential Documents \nDespite these funding disparities, research has shown that HSIs tend to \ndo more for Hispanic and Latino student success than non-HSI colleges and universities—and do so with fewer resources. Many HSIs are leaders in promoting economic mobility for Hispanic and Latino students, including by closing college access, completion, and success gaps. Hispanic-Serving Institutions could further improve outcomes for students if they were ade-quately funded. The Federal Government must strengthen the capacity of HSIs to improve and expand their reach, while recognizing that HSIs face discrete challenges and opportunities that reflect their history and the com-munities they serve. \nAs set forth in Executive Order 14045 of September 13, 2021 (White House \nInitiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Op-portunity for Hispanics), the Federal Government must collaborate with Hispanic and Latino communities to ensure their long-term success, including by eliminating barriers to Federal funding and strengthening the capacity of HSIs. This order builds on those policies by establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity Through Hispanic-Serving Institutions and the President’s Board of Advisors on Hispanic-Serving Institutions. \nIt is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity, excel-\nlence, and economic opportunity through strong partnerships with HSIs to ensure that they have access to Federal resources to help current and future generations of students succeed. The Federal Government must col-laborate with HSIs and the students, families, and communities they serve to address and overcome barriers that may impede educational attainment and upward economic mobility. Strengthening the capacity of the Nation’s HSIs is critical to fulfilling that objective. \nSec. 2. White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, \nand Economic Opportunity Through Hispanic-Serving Institutions. (a) In \nfurtherance of the policy set forth in section 1 of this order, there is estab-\nlished within the Department of Education (Department) the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Op-portunity Through Hispanic-Serving Institutions (Initiative), of which the Secretary of Education (Secretary) shall serve as Chair. The Secretary shall designate an Executive Director for the Initiative (Executive Director). The Executive Director shall manage the day-to-day operations of the Initiative, in consultation with the Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, as appropriate, and coordinate with senior officials in the Executive Office of the President, who shall lend their expertise and advice to the Initiative. \n(b) The Initiative shall advance educational equity, excellence, and eco-\nnomic opportunity through HSIs by focusing on the following goals: \n(i) identifying and promoting the availability of Federal programs and resources to enhance HSIs’ educational capacity, including with respect to research and infrastructure development, while also breaking down barriers and expanding pathways for HSIs to access such programs and resources; \n(ii) identifying best practices for HSIs on developing, implementing, ex-\npanding, and sustaining strategies, programs, and initiatives that support the educational success and economic mobility of their students; \n(iii) improving the ability of HSIs to align their program offerings with \nthe Nation’s economic needs and promote opportunities for careers in critical professions, with an emphasis on increasing the number of students preparing for careers in in-demand and high-wage fields, such as science, technology, engineering, and math, as well as teaching, including bilingual and multilingual education; \n(iv) coordinating efforts to improve the fiscal security of HSIs; (v) developing new relationships, and fostering collaboration, among HSIs \nand philanthropic organizations, public- and private-sector organizations, \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 21:59 Jul 19, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\22JYE0.SGM 22JYE0ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-E0\n59587 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 140 / Monday, July 22, 2024 / Presidential Documents \nelementary and secondary education providers, labor unions, and other \nentities to improve postsecondary affordability and degree attainment, path-ways for students to enroll in HSIs, career preparation at HSIs, and employ-ment opportunities that advance economic mobility for HSI students and graduates; \n(vi) strengthening Federal recruitment activities at HSIs to build accessible \nand equitable pathways into Federal career opportunities for HSI students, faculty, staff, and alumni; \n(vii) encouraging HSIs, as institutions that provide students with degrees \nthat lead to upward economic mobility, to participate in Federal policy-making processes; \n(viii) encouraging the development of highly qualified, diverse, multi-\nlingual, and culturally responsive educators who support and instruct HSI students and contribute to effectively meeting those students’ social, emotional, and academic needs; and \n(ix) providing data, tools, and analytics to support HSIs in improving \neducational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for students. \n(c) On an annual basis, the Executive Director, in consultation with the \nAssistant to the President for Domestic Policy, shall report to the President \non the Initiative’s progress in carrying out its mission and function under this order. \n(d) The Executive Director shall meet regularly with HSI students, leaders, \nand other representatives to discuss matters related to the Initiative’s mission and function. \n(e) The Department shall provide funding and administrative support for \nthe Initiative to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropria-tions.

President’s Board of Advisors on Hispanic-Serving Institutions. (a) \nIn furtherance of the policy described in section 1 of this order, there \nis established within the Department the President’s Board of Advisors on Hispanic-Serving Institutions (Board). \n(b) The Board shall consist of not more than 21 members, appointed \nby the President, and may include individuals who serve as representatives of their respective organizations and institutions, such as educational institu-tions, educational advocacy organizations, labor organizations, research insti-tutions, public and private philanthropic organizations, private-sector organi-zations, nonprofit organizations, and community-based organizations. Mem-bers of the Board should be knowledgeable about the experiences of those who attend, work for, and work to strengthen HSIs. \n(c) The President shall designate one member of the Board to serve as \nits Chair, and may designate another member of the Board to serve as Vice Chair. The Chair, in consultation with the Executive Director of the Initiative, shall convene regular meetings of the Board, determine the Board meeting agenda, and support the work of the Board consistent with this order. \n(d) The Department shall provide funding and administrative support \nfor the Board to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropria-tions.

Purpose. My Administration has fought and will continue to \nfight anti-Semitism in the United States and around the world. On December \n11, 2019, I issued Executive Order 13899, my first Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism, finding that students, in particular, faced anti- Semitic harassment in schools and on university and college campuses. Executive Order 13899 provided interpretive assistance on the enforcement of the Nation’s civil rights laws to ensure that they would protect American Jews to the same extent to which all other American citizens are protected. The prior administration effectively nullified Executive Order 13899 by fail-ing to give the terms of the order full force and effect throughout the Government. This order reaffirms Executive Order 13899 and directs addi-tional measures to advance the policy thereof in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, against the people of Israel. These attacks unleashed an unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our citizens, especially in our schools and on our campuses. Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and phys-ical threats and assault. A joint report by the House Committees on Education and the Workforce, Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, Oversight and Account-ability, Veterans’ Affairs, and Ways and Means calls the Federal Government’s failure to fight anti-Semitism and protect Jewish students ‘‘astounding.’’ This failure is unacceptable and ends today. \nSec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States to combat anti- \nSemitism vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to pros-\necute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence. \nSec. 3. Additional Measures to Combat Campus Anti-Semitism.

        "body": "Presidential Documents8757 Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 21 / Monday, February 3, 2025 / Presidential Documents \nExecutive Order 14183 of January 27, 2025 \nPrioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness \nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \nlaws of the United States of America, and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, and to ensure the readiness and effective-ness of our Armed Forces, it is hereby ordered: \nSection 1. Purpose. The United States military has a clear mission: to protect \nthe American people and our homeland as the world’s most lethal and \neffective fighting force. Success in this existential mission requires a singular focus on developing the requisite warrior ethos, and the pursuit of military excellence cannot be diluted to accommodate political agendas or other ideologies harmful to unit cohesion. \nRecently, however, the Armed Forces have been afflicted with radical gender \nideology to appease activists unconcerned with the requirements of military service like physical and mental health, selflessness, and unit cohesion. Longstanding Department of Defense (DoD) policy (DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6130.03) provides that it is the policy of the DoD to ensure that service members are ‘‘[f]ree of medical conditions or physical defects that may reasonably be expected to require excessive time lost from duty for necessary treatment or hospitalization.’’ As a result, many mental and physical health conditions are incompatible with active duty, from conditions that require substantial medication or medical treatment to bipolar and related disorders, eating disorders, suicidality, and prior psychiatric hospitalization. \nConsistent with the military mission and longstanding DoD policy, expressing \na false ‘‘gender identity’’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service. Beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life. A man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member. \nFor the sake of our Nation and the patriotic Americans who volunteer \nto serve it, military service must be reserved for those mentally and physically fit for duty. The Armed Forces must adhere to high mental and physical health standards to ensure our military can deploy, fight, and win, including in austere conditions and without the benefit of routine medical treatment or special provisions. \nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States Government to establish \nhigh standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, \nuniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, sur-gical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria. This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pro-nouns that inaccurately reflect an individual’s sex. \nSec. 3. Definitions.
