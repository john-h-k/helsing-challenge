This resulted from the incorporation of China and other developing countries into the world economy. There followed a profound shift in the balance of power between labour and capital and a tilt in the distributional struggle between debtors and creditors in favour of the latter.

Think only of the wholesale politicisation of monetary policy at times in Turkey or Argentina to register the point. The ability to carry out monetary policy insulated from governmental pressure is clearly valuable.

In effect the US economy will confront big supply shocks coinciding with expansionary fiscal policy.

What about if it is based on your feelings of guilt that your children have been left to care for you, with the wait for social care longer than your life expectancy?

There is, undeniably, a coercive impetus here, but the bill remains silent on these complications."}, {"type": "text", "content": "Such considerations tie in with another concern that the bill fails to address: coercion from medical and legal professionals themselves.

There are always people who will not budge on the topic of vaccination, but there is also a larger group who may delay on the basis of vaguely recalled rumours.

This resulted from the incorporation of China and other developing countries into the world economy.

In effect the US economy will confront big supply shocks coinciding with expansionary fiscal policy.
